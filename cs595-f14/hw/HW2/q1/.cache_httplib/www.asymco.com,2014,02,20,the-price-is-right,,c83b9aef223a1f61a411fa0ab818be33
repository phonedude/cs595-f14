			<div class="entry-content">
				<p>One of the axioms of hardware business is that prices fall over time. The consumer price index for personal computers and peripheral equipment from 1998 to 2014 is shown below:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.asymco.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/CUUR0000SEEE01_Max_630_378.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-6199" alt="CUUR0000SEEE01_Max_630_378" src="http://www.asymco.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/CUUR0000SEEE01_Max_630_378-620x372.png" width="620" height="372" /></a></p>
<p>The price index suggests that prices for computers should be 54% of 2007 levels. Charles Arthur <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/09/pc-value-trap-windows-chrome-hp-dell-lenovo-asus-acer">illustrated this</a> on a global basis using a separate set of data.</p>
<blockquote><p>The data shows that the weighted average selling price (ASP) of a PC has fallen from $614.60 in the first quarter of 2010 to just $544.30 in the third quarter of 2013, the most recent date for which data is available.</p></blockquote>
<p><span id="more-6196"></span>The result is a chronically low margin for computer manufacturers. As Charles points out, the average profit for a PC is less than the price of a coffee at Starbucks. LG and Sony&#8217;s exits from the market are symptomatic of the crisis. This is not a new phenomenon. There has been a long series of mergers, acquisitions and exits by incumbents.</p>
<p>Except of course for one incumbent.</p>
<p>The Mac, aged 30, seems to soldier on. Phil Schiller noted that of its original competitors, Apple is the only PC maker to still be in the market. One could imagine that this existence is marginal, or that the Mac managed to survive by giving up on unit volumes or pricing.</p>
<p>The following graph shows the revenue per unit for the Mac and its volumes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.asymco.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-20-at-2.59.43-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-6198" alt="Screen Shot 2014-02-20 at 2.59.43 PM" src="http://www.asymco.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-20-at-2.59.43-PM-620x214.png" width="620" height="214" /></a></p>
<p>The Mac not only continues to preserve pricing but it also seems to grow volumes at a time of overall market decline. Going back to the consumer price index, the Mac in December 2007 was priced, on average, at $1539. In December 2014, the price was $1322, with $40 deferred.</p>
<p>So rather than being 54% of December 2007 prices, the Mac is almost at 90%.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll note that along with the Mac I also illustrate the pricing of Apple&#8217;s other devices. Even with the iPod, the pricing has remained stubbornly consistent for over 7 years. Whether the volumes are falling, rising rapidly or remaining flat, Apple&#8217;s product pricing remains predictably consistent.</p>
<p>The point being that the violation of the axiomatic price erosion rule in PCs is not anomalous. It suggests something about the violation of the same rule in devices. It suggests that perhaps the company does not respond to the same market forces.</p>
<p>But we already know that. Jony Ive <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/apple/9283486/Jonathan-Ive-interview-Apples-design-genius-is-British-to-the-core.html">told us as much</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We’re keenly aware that when we develop and make something and bring it to market that it really does speak to a set of values. And what preoccupies us is that sense of care, and what our products will not speak to is a schedule, what our products will not speak to is trying to respond to some corporate or competitive agenda. We’re very genuinely designing the best products that we can for people.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The result is plain to see: Caring about the product means that it can be priced at a point which consumers care to pay.</p>
<p>Trouble is, judging by how Apple is valued, nobody believes that this is sustainable. Regardless of the evidence within Apple&#8217;s own history, it&#8217;s the exception, not the rule and the bet continues to be that they cannot continue to remain an exception.</p>
<p>Is Apple going to continue to repeal the laws that govern its industry, as it has for decades, or will it, as the market expects, abide by them?</p>

<p>Other than Ive&#8217;s comment —that is surely right— Apple is (almost) the only company that integrated hard&amp;soft… and volume.<br />
I can remember Amiga having its OS, Sun/Solaris, and other intents (like Be). But neither one had volume.</p>
<p>I think that to do Ive&#8217;s comment a reality, Apple had to follow Alan Kay&#8217;s advice: &#8220;Those who loves software, own the hardware.&#8221; (My words from the top of my mind.)</p>

<p>To my eyes, the implosion of that segment is one of the more interesting features of the recent smartphone market. Nokia dumped a bunch of 520&#8242;s into the market and either got the tail end of it, or simply trashed it. </p>
<p>(If I&#8217;m wrong, and the 5C was actually meant to capture China, then Apple is a lot stupider than I think and it owns the resultant low sales more.)</p>

Apple couldn&#8217;t have continued to make the 5 without substantially smaller margins than with th 5C.  </p>
<p>So I think it&#8217;s important to be specific in what you are comparing the choice to build the 5C with:  discontinuing the 5 and offering only the 5S?  Building a 5C with a metal case identical to the 5S?  Continuing to sell the 5 without design changes?  Or creating a clearly differentiated 2nd tier product?  </p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-58721" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>My belief was that the 5C was meant to be a clearly-differentiated, but <b>NOT 2nd-tier,</b> product for more active, younger and/or less formal-identifying users.</p>
<p>I believe it was meant to broaden the range of people Apple could appeal to strongly. I.e., it allowed Apple to make the 5S even more precious/jewel-like, which some love while others disdain…have a hard time relating to. Yes, a lower price would be part of that mix, but if you use my SUV analogy, you&#8217;ll note that many brands price the SUVs above their better sedans.</p>
<p>Ideally, the 5C would&#8217;ve gone to users who didn&#8217;t previously buy at the 5S level of price. But realistically, Apple would&#8217;ve been happy for more users to have switched to the 5C, and anticipated as much. In any case, the assembly costs are a tiny fraction of the sales prices and much less than the price difference between the two models; fab costs must be quite secondary to producing the product that its customers want to buy. Which, unsurprisingly, is pretty much what Apple has said, repeatedly.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-58724" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I tend to agree wih Boltar. Apple encountered a real problem with production of the aluminum-cased iPhone. As recently as last quarter we saw them run up against that limitation. The 4 and 4S were far more capable of growing production capacity. In effect, Apple got backed into a corner with the aluminum housing.</p>
<p>I think Apple is encountering a similar problem with the iPad: The aluminum enclosure is resisting scaling up, production-wise, since iPads need to compete with iPhones for machine time.</p>
<p>The plastic enclosure isn&#8217;t a bad idea, but it definitely needs to drop down to a lower price tier to truly be effective. Even there, it&#8217;s a question whether it isn&#8217;t wiser to create yet a fourth tier and keep the 4S around.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d also create a second tier plastic iPad ASAP, maybe  even mid-fiscal year. That will allow aluminum iPhone production to increase in the Fall.</p>
<p>Longer term, perhaps Apple can return to the 4/4S approach, but with saphire front and back. Now THAT would be a real gem!</p>

The old iPhone model is as luxury as the new one, it is only an older model the owner will change in due time, but the taste of the owner of an older model is the same as the owner of the new model, they only bought the iPhone in different times.<br />
The 5C is not the best model and you have bought is now that the 5S is available, so your taste for luxury is somewhat inferior. Buying a 5 today would not convey the same information about the owner than buying a 5C.</p>

<p>The 5C is a high quality device, irregardless of the purposefully created misperceptions being floated by Apple&#8217;s enemies. And over time, it will be seen as what it is; a lower priced yet still high quality entry device into the Apple ecosystem. Next year, the 5SC will have all the capability of the 5S at a substantially lower price. I expect it will sell like crazy.</p>

<p>In part it means building products that ultimately polarizes consumers and Wall Street. It means a pattern of growth that doesn&#8217;t follow the same pattern of its peers.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s refusal &#8211; overt or otherwise &#8211; to cow-tow is received by the market as dumb luck when the graph spikes upwards or anti-capitalistic when the same graph flattens out briefly (see demands to sell low-market products in every category to &#8220;fix&#8221; the all of Apple&#8217;s supposed problems). The sure sign of iDoom occurs when the graph turns downward for a quarter. The Macintosh is the poster child here, with its track record of out selling PCs in 30 of 31 previous quarters.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Apple turns in a seemingly unattended masterclass quarter after quarter by shipping a increasing numbers of product driven by values wholly _different_ from its competition. Were Apple building cars or handbags (say Porsche or Hermes, for example) I assume the company would not be the target of so much skepticism. But my question after being an Apple customer since &#8217;86 remains, why does Apple piss people off so much?</p>

They have to do with the persistent problems with iCloud (which appear to have been fixed, but it&#8217;s difficult to tell because so many developers were so burned) and Apple&#8217;s weak bench in machine learning. </p>
<p>Apple can charge more because they are (more or less) the best tool for the job. That changes if what the competition is offering may not look as nice and may have a clumsier UI, BUT it has contextual computing nailed, can do real-time translation in your ear, can scan your emails to remind you of things you should have done (or should not have included in the mail), etc etc. </p>
<p>Maps was a harbinger. Apple managed to recover from that (after some stumbling) but Maps is only the start. And maps shows the point. No matter how much you love your iPhone, if it didn&#8217;t have Maps (in any form &#8212; no app, not even a clumsy web interface) would that make you switch to Android? It probably would make me switch.</p>
<p>Contextual computing (in all its many forms) is the next Maps. Now, Translate, Goggles, these are all fragments of what we will expect from our future devices, and in all of them Apple is weak to non-existent.</p>

<p>I also like your Maps example. Surely Apple, even in its most full-of-BS moments, could not have thought that a function that Nokia bought for a few billion, could be duplicated with a couple dozen man-years and some 3rd-party data suppliers. More likely, in what was less than their most glorious hour, they predicted <b>pretty near exactly</b> what actually happened: users stayed with iPhones&#8217; weaker offering long enough for the worst of the V1.0 kinks to get worked out. IOW, Maps is not the killer app for many users, while other measures of quality, privacy and support continue to favor Cupertino.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Apple&#8217;s obvious show of power didn&#8217;t go unnoticed in Mountain View; these days stock Android appears to bump up against fewer of the Apple-claimed UX features and Android&#8217;s rapid ascent worldwide has not been matched by its market share in the wealthiest markets where both Apple and Google derive the great bulk of their income.</p>

<p>My time is worth something: I can&#8217;t bother to manage the computer, nor deal with getting the best out of it; or imagine that I will want to make some kind of hobby of it at the end of the day.</p>
<p>And I can&#8217;t be so idealistic that the mere idea of choosing one poor product simply because there are thousands of poor products to choose from on the same &#8220;open&#8221; or &#8220;customizable&#8221; platform should be any kind of incentive for me.</p>
<p>Have some jobs to be done, weigh the up-front cost with time and TCO, and choose the best tool. Done. Quality + productivity = high-value. The only &#8220;luxury&#8221; involved is peace of mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Luxuries&#8221;: Peace of mind (underrated) vs. Time (non-existent) and Idealism (overrated).</p>

Usually it is associated or come with high price, but it is not mandatory, it is a feeling some objects, experiences, have and some have not.<br />
If the object is felt as a luxury price is maintained over time much more easily.</p>

Luxury: a state of great confort and elegance<br />
Premium: an amount to be paid &#8230;<br />
I don&#8217;t see Apple&#8217;s product as premium, that is an old song about the apple&#8217;s cost, a markup put on less valued products.<br />
It is not so. The 27&#8243; iMac cost less than competitor&#8217;s equivalent solution, the iPad air is unmatched in price by competitors, even without considering TCO, and on and on.<br />
Apple management of the supply chain can deliver quality products at competitive price mostly unmatched by competitors, more so if you consider TCO.<br />
But Apple products are luxury items because the user experience is the one associated with luxury, they are elegant and comfortable and they convey the sense of owning something peculiar apart from other products.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-58793" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Premium vs luxury &#8212; actually it&#8217;s both, I think.  Obviously Apple has created an air of brand cachet, of coolness about their products.  </p>
<p>At the same time, they are very careful to make all their products be premium machines with high end specifications. For instance, aside from special educational i3 imacs, they don&#8217;t make<br />
any computers with celeron, pentium, or i3 processors. IIRC, except for their smallest form factor machines, all of their computers are equipped with at least quad core processors. Likewise, they&#8217;ve<br />
transitioned away from putting SATA ssd&#8217;s in their machines in favor of<br />
PCIe ssds. </p>
<p>I think a third strand to how they&#8217;ve kept the price of their computers from collapsing the way the rest of the industry has, is uniqueness &#8212; they don&#8217;t make generic computers.  Instead of beige desktops, they make NUC-style nanocomputers, all-in-ones, and professional workstations, all of which command a price premium compared to regular tower desktops.  The last few years they&#8217;ve been doubling down on the uniqueness aspect &#8212; their workstation used to *look* like a generic tower desktop, now it doesn&#8217;t.  Their laptops used to be unique only if you did a comparison of specs, now they&#8217;ve transitioned them to be all about ultraportability, with your choice of extremely thin &amp; light or slightly heavier but much more powerful with an ultra-high resolution display.</p>

If it only costs $1000 to own a luxury item like an Apple computer, then that&#8217;s not much of a price considering what you get from it. The relative price of owning an Apple product has gone down as the basic price has remained fairly steady, in part because of inflation and in part because people are willing to stretch to $1000 dollars for what they perceive as value. And even if they can&#8217;t afford that stretch, they can now buy a first class iPad for that price. It isn&#8217;t that much of a luxury in users&#8217; day to day lives. It&#8217;s a reasonable price for what they get and they know they are getting the best. So why settle for a cheaper, less capable non-luxury version?</p>

<p>So here&#8217;s a very crude SWAG: a 1998 IBM announcement has a 233 MHz Pentium II “priced at just $1,099”  and featuring “16 MB of SDRAM, and a 2.5 GB hard drive.” That machine would of course be unsalable today; today&#8217;s top-of-the-line MacBookPro might have 16GB (1000X) of memory and 1TB (400X) of much faster SSD storage, with maybe 50X the CPU throughput. Call it maybe 80X overall versus the nearly $4000 for the BTO being 4X the price, and you get pretty close to a price index 5% (4X/80X) of the 1998 cost for similar performance.</p>
<p>(Imperfect, in that the MacBook includes a first-class display, which the IBM did not, the keyboard is NOT 50X better, GPUs, yada yada.)</p>

<p>It IS true that the price of computing (and related issues like data storage,communication, even printing) have fallen astonishingly, and continue to fall, but that is an orthogonal issue to the fact that the PC market has become commoditized. </p>
<p>If you&#8217;re going to link the two, I think you have to spell out the link, because it&#8217;s not quite obvious. Perhaps the fact that computing is not just so cheap, but that most of us have all the compute we need is the link &#8212; ten years ago many of us were willing to pay the extra costs of the high end model (of any brand) because it delivered value we needed; now most consumers don&#8217;t care whether their laptop has a dual core i3 or a quad-core AMD &#8212; either way they know it&#8217;s good enough, so just look at the price. </p>
<p>The real story here is commodification, not the lower price of digital items.<br />
Airline tickets in the US, for example, are a commodity and have been subject to the same dynamic. </p>
<p>Autos represent the path that might have been &#8212; superficially a commodity, but the companies involved have done enough around various more-or-less intangible issues (branding, image, differentiation that may be superficial but is not completely worthless). </p>
<p>PCs might have gone down this path (as a simple example charging a little more for  crapware free, sticker free PC, or &#8220;we&#8217;re the one-and-only laptop company that sells you a trackpad that isn&#8217;t complete crap&#8221;) but none of them did. I&#8217;m not sure why. Maybe business sales were not receptive to the idea? Maybe MS and Intel between them had too much ability to force certain (in retrospect stupid) ideas like &#8220;you only get sticker money if you put the stickers on EVERY PC you ship&#8221;. Maybe the problem is that, pretty much from the day the 386 shipped, the PC vendors (like airlines, but not as mych like auto manufacturers) really WERE just what we think of them as today &#8212; engineering-free, IP-free assemblers with no value-add whatsoever, undeserving of any profit because they don&#8217;t do anything of real value? (That&#8217;s what happens when you have someone else doing all the hard parts&#8230;)</p>
<p>Relevance to today?<br />
ARM, Qualcomm, Broadcomm and Google are doing all the hard parts&#8230; HTC, Nokia, etc are doing very little that provide value customers care about. Samsung has managed to be king of this particular commodity, but with a very tenuous grip, and with little evidence that THEY  can provide additional value customers are willing to pay for. (Samsung does some parts of the hard stuff &#8212; eg the IC manufacturing &#8212; internally, which gives them some advantage, but until they have their own OS or their CPU design they&#8217;re still basically in the commodity game.)</p>
<p>I see no reason why Acer selling a me-too tablet, or Lenovo selling some weird Android+Windows hybrid is going to change any of this dynamic. They&#8217;re all still selling commodity products with NOTHING about them that makes a customer willing to pay 10% more.</p>

<p>They track maybe hundreds of attributes and attempt to bridge them at three different quality levels, working with models that change every few months (while old models stay on sale at higher prices, obscuring actual cuts). Yes, complicated. At least they don&#8217;t use the “hedonic” approach that would drown in the mess of data.</p>
<p>Your notes about the industry are interesting. Maybe 5 years ago, many believed that Intel had the CPU wars won, thanks to the billions of expense to fab at the next smaller geometry. The huge volumes in smartphones, which weren&#8217;t as performance sensitive, did the classic disruption thing, and now Intel finds itself competing with firms that have been able to finance their own expertise with high volumes of cheap parts.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;ll pile on a gratuitous shot at Samsung: not only do they need a differentiator; it needs to be perceived as more attractive. With Android OS costs trending pretty close to $0.00, we&#8217;re talking software features that Samsung has pretty spectacularly failed at impressing with.</p>

<p>My impression is that the strongest patents that Microsoft has asserted are already over a decade old. Doesn&#8217;t look like a growth industry for Microsoft. Nor would an alternative be a source of competitive differentiation, since the MS patents are very fundamental to OS&#8217;s. </p>
<p>Which was the point that the economic incentive to an alternative is near zero. As Google says, they&#8217;ve leveled the playing field, albeit leaving Apple some premium UX features.</p>

So when the iPhone showed up on the scene, we saw headlines about Nokia v Apple, etc.; those have faded.</p>
<p>Google and the Android partnership companies remain in the headlines, in part because those companies compete in nations with strong Intellectual Property regimes (the US and EU, especially), but also in weak-IP-rule countries such as India and China.  You can&#8217;t compete well if you lack features in the strong nations (where most of the ASP and profit is) and you can&#8217;t compete in the weak-IP nations (where the volume is) if you&#8217;re paying $40 more per handset for IP. These are existential issues so the fight goes on.</p>
<p>Regards Microsoft, Motorola is the sole Android® partner that has NOT seen the logic of settling with Microsoft; others went the licensing route. Especially inasmuch as Lenovo is a (the?) major Windows OEM, I imagine the Moto settlement will come soon enough, too.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-58697" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Great post! Is making me rethink whether Apple needs to sell a more affordable version of the iPhone (a la Christensen). Apple seems to be making a deliberate choice to avoid the &#8220;loser&#8217;s game&#8221; of price driven competition, which often seems like the net outcome of following Christensen&#8217;s advice to the letter.</p>
<p>It reminds me of the following quote from Benjamin Graham: &#8220;You can get in way more trouble with a good idea than a bad idea, because you forget the good idea has limits.&#8221; Apple&#8217;s first priority is making great products that consumers value. They can make these products affordable without following the low end herd and diving into blood red competitive waters. From a long term strategic standpoint, it makes little sense for Apple to copy the behavior of its competitors, as your post demonstrates.</p>
<p>A company&#8217;s goal should be a unique strategy that other companies can&#8217;t match &#8212; herd-like behavior is contrary to the goal of a unique, hard to match strategy in which priorities, processes, and resources fit well together (a la Christensen and Michael Porter).</p>
<p>If Apple is going to grow, then it&#8217;s going to be through new products like the &#8220;health maintenance&#8221; watch you mentioned in one of your recent podcasts. These kind of complementary products enhance Apple&#8217;s bundling strategy, and will drive sales growth in existing products like the iPhone (just like the iPhone has helped drive growth in Mac sales).</p>

<p>The other point to recall is that Apple isn&#8217;t interested in growing itself for the sake of growth. I personally suspect that to be the real reason the market isn&#8217;t giving AAPL the valuation it deserves. If a company isn&#8217;t perceived to be interested in huge ROI&#8217;s, then it&#8217;s stock is punished.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s interesting with Apple is that, because of its ability to make lateral, disruptive moves, it can in fact engender huge boosts in growth, thus continually surprising the market. But it must always be remembered that such growth spurts are in effect a secondary reaction, and never Apple&#8217;s primary focus.</p>

Everything that grows off that could be argued to be secondary reactions. The iPhone was the gateway drug to most non-Apple users, before that the iPod. The secondary reactions are seen in the additional Macs, MacBook, AppleTVs and so on sold. The iPad is somewhere in between. Established Apple customers jumped on it but it is bringing even more new people onboard.</p>

<p>Porter says this happens slowly, over time, leading to more and more industry homogeneity and direct competition. In this scenario, companies in an industry end up competing based solely on operational effectiveness, leading to price wars and declining margins. The point is that companies should preserve their unique strategies and pursue organic, sustainable growth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Today’s Market is beguiled by huge ROI’s. If a stock doesn’t appear to be able to provide it, the Market isn’t interested&#8230;[but] the Market, when it becomes irrational, loses the ability to separate wheat from chaff. Huge bets are placed on the chaff, forcing it up out of all reason. Meanwhile, boring old wheat languishes, because there’s no perception of a [potential] large ROI there.</p>
<p>That’s all fine and dandy, until the chaff gets blown away in the wind of reality, and only the wheat remains&#8230;Between two and three months from now, we’re going to see the wind of reality again make itself known, with more chaff getting blown away. Those who have either been nimble or have invested in wheat will be vindicated.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bring &#8216;em on!</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s first remember that Apple&#8217;s past success is all about not being the first kid on the block with a music player or computerphone or tablet; that success came from recognizing a set of customers with identifiable needs, and selling a product that those customers found good enough that they didn&#8217;t need to bother putting the pieces together to make a superior solution. </p>
<p>The 5C, for instance, <i>could have been</i> such a product, a more knockabout stablemate for young/hip consumers in wealthy markets, to complement the 5S jewelry. Nobody seems to think the 5C was a new product, however… just a day-late, dollar-short variant on a 6-year-old line. I don&#8217;t see how it could ever have competed against the no-IP, 2G devices in India and other low-income, IP-lite nations, so doubt that it was ever so intended. More likely, in another year or two the C line, with perhaps another $100 or $200 savings against the top of the line, could look pretty good against whatever Samsung fields in the price range. It <i>may yet</i> be such a product.</p>
<p>PS: in the next few months, Google is rumored to perform a substantial revamp to the low-level mechanism that Android uses to run programs, and while I expect there&#8217;ll be backward compatibility, the best performance and features <i>could</i> require notably different hardware and drivers that will tax the weaker OHA partners. Raising the bar on support could be helpful for its partners countering the open-source Android-like firms and could even change the relationship between fully-licensed Android® and the open-source. This could significantly shift the economics in countries that now find older-version Android phones good enough.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-58791" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Thanks for response Walt! It made me think of one other relevant point. While I do believe Apple can grow and deepen its strategic advantage through new integrated devices, Porter notes that the pursuit of global growth is a great way for a company to continue growing in a sustainable way without sacrificing a unique strategy. Apple is pursuing this exact strategy, pushing its devices and iTunes/App Store ecosystem all over the world. And unlike Google, Facebook, etc., Apple is only making acquisitions that enhance its integrated hardware/software products (e.g., AuthenTec, the GT Global sapphire deal, the recently announced TestFlight deal, etc.). Apple is using acquisitions to deepen its strategy of hard to match, integrated hardware/software products. </p>
<p>Contrast these acquisitions with the almost incoherent, defensive, and market share dominance based acquisitions of Facebook and Google. If you don&#8217;t have a unique, hard to match strategy, just buy up everything and go for market share dominance (hoping you don&#8217;t end up in a futile, whack a mole effort involving endless acquisitions of small, overpriced, but potentially threatening competitors).</p>

Disruption theory is more than a simple dichotomy of &#8220;high&#8221; and &#8220;low&#8221;.

It seems like where you are on that vertical scale depends, to a large degree, on the distinctiveness of your strategy. Apple&#8217;s at the high end because it has a unique, hard to duplicate strategy that leads to highly differentiated products. Android and AOSP phones are at the low end because they don&#8217;t have a unique strategy, so they&#8217;re subject to direct industry rivalry, price driven competition, and/or exorbitant advertising expenses (a la Michael Porter). It&#8217;s interesting that a notable exception to this brutal price-cutting may be Xiaomi, precisely because it does have a unique strategy that no one else is following.</p>

<p>Apple is getting away with what they can get away with, and they will do so until they can&#8217;t any more. And they are where they are largely because of the lie that are subsidized smartphone plans.</p>
<p>It is actually remarkable seeing people celebrate what is in effect greed at enormous scales. I&#8217;m a believer that greed is, effectively, good (Gekko), however to see people celebrate as if they are party to it is simply bizarre.</p>
<p>Apple could sell every one of their products for 1/2 the price and every employee would be paid just as well. The company would be healthy and robust. Etc. But they don&#8217;t because they don&#8217;t have to &#8212; you&#8217;ll pay the price regardless, probably lying to yourself about what it costs.</p>

<p>They obviously couldn&#8217;t because their net margin is not 50%. Unless you mean until their cash ran out, in which case they could easily give away every one of their products, by the same argument.</p>

What it <b>doesn&#8217;t</b> show is the <i>rate</i> at which (the BLS believes) the price has fallen. It makes it look like—<b>falsely implies</b> despite our brains&#8217; attempts to counter what our eyes clearly see—almost all the drop happened before 2002. This although we know performance per dollar continues to improve and that the ability to do more per dollar is hugely important in recent trends, especially smartphones.</p>
<p>The BLS conveniently allows users to select log scales; see <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?chart_type=line&#038;s1id=CUUR0000SEEE01&#038;log_scales=Left" rel="nofollow">http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?chart_type=line&#038;s1id=CUUR0000SEEE01&#038;log_scales=Left</a><br />
(Below the chart, you can pop down the “Graph” menu and also choose features such as a larger size.) This chart plainly shows the quick decline in prices in the earlier years (up to -35% per year early on!) and the reaccelerating of declines since 2010, but still only in the range of -7% – -10%. I got those numbers from the data download option, but they are visible in the log chart, which they are NOT in the linear chart.</p>
<p>BTW, the BLS page on the computer CPI shows how heroically they struggle to find what consumers are paying for a given level of quality, when quality is so sharply improving. And it&#8217;s important to note that the index displayed is for computers <i>and peripherals</i> that consumers spend their dollars on; printers, CD readers and the like all are all somehow included.</p>
<p>The linear scale chart appears (to me) to emphasize only the single fact of computers&#8217; price reductions over the last 15 years, with the caveat I gave above. That&#8217;s hardly news. The log scale shows the drop, plus makes visible:<br />
• over the range, prices have dropped to about 5% of their early value<br />
• rapid declines early; recent declines at only 1/3 the earlier rate<br />
• a pause around 2010, perhaps from reduced capex in the 2009 timeframe.<br />
• specific declines are easier to pick off: in the last 7 years prices have dropped by about half; in the prior <b>5</b> years they&#8217;d dropped about the same amount.</p>
<p>Maybe the things you can see in the log chart aren&#8217;t helpful, but I&#8217;d think anybody who cares about the chart would want the extras I can see, and I invite responses as to what facts are both important today and more visible, in the linear chart.</p>

<p>	The factor not included in the data is the lack of increase in processor speeds since those are limited by frequency.  If you were graphing the quality of the transistor per dollar, rather than the price per &#8220;machine&#8221; you would have seen a very different story.  Customers are no longer buying machines that offer a compelling improvement in processing speed.  A 4 year old computer today is now more analogous to a 4 year old TV rather than a 4 year old computer from 1999.  The power envelope is the limiting factor not the geometry that drove the earlier heyday of Moore’s Law.  One result of this is low powered devices were not limited by the same problems and actually were able to ramp frequency while computer’s could not.  A cell phone now offers much of the functionality of a $400 computer.  Sales of traditional computer’s will continue to drop because the product turnover is dropping, and there is more competition from other kinds of devices.  Dropping demand for computer’s definitely means there is less investment money to pay for the next processor node.  </p>
<p>	What I am curious about is why has the obvious slow down in increases of computer speeds been so ignored by the press? There has been more technology innovation than in the 90’s, but we have seen less growth in productivity.  Perhaps if we could name the problem, the solution would get more attention. Two types of processors have continued to improve while CPU’s of average PC’s have stagnated.  One is the graphics processor because of it’s ability to harness more improvement from running multiple cores, and the other is the low power computing devices.  Area’s economic productivity have followed in the wake of each of these two exceptions.  Petroleum exploration has benefited from the ability to find oil that was not practical to extract because this is processed with multicore machines with large graphics processors.  Cell phones are another growth area with smart phones leading the way towards new business innovation.  Apple’s big bet on ARM makes much more sense if we look at what happened to the 5th generation PowerPC chip and how it failed to match the growth in processor speeds that Intel was producing.</p>

<p>First, the tech press has been on the speed/power tradeoff at least since maybe 2009, when it was obvious that a huge market for smartphones existed, that Chipzilla was ill-equipped to serve. </p>
<p>Second, you need to be careful about measuring a chip purely by clock speed. Jobs that can exploit multiple cores well (and of challenging uses, that&#8217;s about all of &#8216;em) get big advantages from multi-core solutions, even with clock-speed untouched. And within a given core, architectural improvements mean some tasks that formerly took 8 clock cycles might now process in 6, or a given core can have more operations in flight in parallel. Realistic workload metrics capture this.</p>
<p>What you ARE seeing is that consumer functions don&#8217;t need the superchips to be able to work very well. I occasionally note less-than-zippy response on this 4-year-old laptop, but realistically I doubt it costs me a minute a day. Maybe when I get my whizbang analytical method going against some test files, then I&#8217;ll spring for a more capable device.</p>
<p>Oh, a PS: I refuted your assertion as if it meant a steady increase in clock speed, but as I&#8217;m sure you know, “Moore&#8217;s Law” says that <i>“the <b>number of transistors</b> on integrated circuits doubles approximately every two years.”</i> The R² of that rule (even in the more challenging log-log form) is VERY high, at least on the 1971-2011 data at Wikipedia.</p>

Or put another way, apples bet on arm doesn&#8217;t have to be so big. I mean, if apple were to buy a foundry , arguable they kind of are, but the history is they haven&#8217;t, then i get why you need your own cpu design teams. But armh by default is a cpu designer. In other words, why not use qualcom or generic arm design. If Armh is commoditizing the cpu, why bother with that level of design integration. It&#8217;s arguable it&#8217;s a differentiator. The phones can&#8217;t last more than a day on battery power, and the processing is done in the cloud. Speaking of cloud, apple sucks here, and there getting taken to school by google.</p>

<p>This is just a terribly cramped understanding of processors and also a misstatement of the BLS data shown here.</p>
<p>I could not find detailed BLS methodology, but the agency describes its attempts to measure “performance,” not simply a single attribute such as speed. This would be expected to (and, I think, <b>does</b>) account for the many architectural feature enhancements in a CPU. For example, bus speeds for communicating to memory, larger amounts of on-die, high-speed cache memory, smarter handling of the two different paths that can happen every time an <b>IF</b> condition is tested, the number of simultaneous instructions handled in each core, and many, many more. (I think those are the most relevant.)</p>
<p>As an example, the <b>current</b> MacBookPro, with a 2.6GHz i7 CPU, delivers about 3X the throughput as <b>this</b> 4-year-old MacBookPro, which has a 2.66GHz i7CPU (as measured by GeekBench). You&#8217;ll see (roughly) similar performance in desktop chips (a 17&#8243; MBP, with a big battery, isn&#8217;t very power-constrained), and in servers, which are likewise very sensitive to time lags accessing memory, lags in switching between processes etc.</p>
<p>The speed shown by this artificial benchmark has a real-world impact. When I have many pages loaded in Safari, my computer now can hang for a second or two when switching between them. That&#8217;s new with Mavericks, because the OS now compresses windows that are out of sight, in order to keep more of them in memory. The tradeoff allows me to keep MORE windows open, but the performance suffers because the compress/expand logic expects a faster CPU.</p>
<p>Of course, a personal computer is MUCH more than just the CPU, and the index measures personal purchases that include monitors, disk drives, networking gear and more. Those other items have NOT increased performance at 30%/year, so today&#8217;s index is dropping at a slower rate. Processor improvements are ALSO increasingly difficult to come by; Intel has obviously been smart enough to go for the lowest-hanging fruit in making their processors more attractive at a given price and heat budget.</p>
<p>Most desktop machines don&#8217;t really need much CPU so if you look at what people buy, it looks like Intel is slowing down much more. But the BLS even attempts to accommodate that, tracking budget, midrange and hi-performance definitions of PCs.</p>
<p>As I originally noted, the price/performance declines <b>have</b> slowed down — and my original point, that of showing the index on a log scale, actually shows that improvements <b>have</b> come a bit slower. (See the <b><a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?chart_type=line&amp;s[1][id]=CUUR0000SEEE01&amp;log_scales=Left" rel="nofollow">chart</a></b>!) But they have not hit a brick wall, as using just clock speed falsely implies.</p>
<p>I think this answers your question: the easy-to-see clock speed is fine for comparisons within a single architecture, but wildly misleading across time; analysts who follow the industry know this and steer journalists from drawing bad conclusions. We should do the same.</p>

They&#8217;re inferior for understanding the absolute (rather than relative) magnitudes of two or more items at selected points in time, as the last two charts do.</p>
<p>A price index has no absolute value — the BLS arbitrarily picks a date where the value is 100 and shows the relative change from there, , so the absolute magnitude is really without interest.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-58710" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Shared values are the foundation of loyalty. The Mac community proved resilient even in tough times and the community of Mac developers, although small, proved to be invaluable to iOS because of its shared values. &#8220;Community&#8221; gets talked about a lot with regard to products nowadays, but how many of those communities have shared values and how many are merely groups of customers? Having a product in common isn&#8217;t enough; that product has to embody values shared by the business and the customer.</p>
<p>What I think is most important to see, though, is that other companies communicate their values with their customers too, it&#8217;s just that those values constitute a cold-hearted utilitarianism. They establish a contract with their customers: &#8220;we do x, y and z &#8211; it says it right here on the box &#8211; and if you can find someone else who does x, y and z for a cheaper price, go to them.&#8221; The relationship is fickle from the start, because it&#8217;s defined that way from the start. What sort of relationship does market research imply? Or focus groups? Or A/B testing? What sort of relationship do business and marketing books full of the psychology of manipulation imply?</p>
<p>This is what Apple understands and Jony Ive articulates so well. Most analysts don&#8217;t understand it because they share the utilitarian values of a Microsoft or a Samsung. In fact, I wonder if this story is less the triumph of Apple and more the failure of business theory, because that whole edifice has been constructed on the wrong moral philosophy.</p>

<p>If Apple had not brought CoreAudio and CoreMIDI to iOS and enabled real multitrack audio and music in GarageBand and thousands of 3rd party apps, then I might think my current iPhone was expensive. But instead, this $700 phone replaced over $1000 of dedicated music and audio gear, and the iPhone setup (with Apogee audio hardware) is faster and has much more storage and much longer battery life and is much smaller and lighter.</p>
<p>The same happened with photo and video and art tools for many users.</p>
<p>Samsung, on the other hand, has re-skinned a bunch of baby Java phone apps that are barely better than Web apps. I can&#8217;t make a $400 Sansung device pay for itself, let alone a $700 one.</p>

<p>It seems that investors cannot get over the low valuation of AAPL recently when it could not be simpler. When Apple stock was shooting for the moon it had incredible year over year growth, things got frothy as they are wont to do in that situation. As soon as the market quite correctly sensed things were leveling off, as they must, the price dropped and has been range bound according to its growth prospects. Yes, the PE ratio is low but in line with the likes of, dare I say it, Microsoft, who the market perceives to have similar prospects. Apple fans seem to be having a lot of trouble coming to terms with the fact that the party is over until Apple can show that it can move the needle on growth. I have faith that they can do that but we&#8217;ll have to take a deep breath until we see the next shiny object. It&#8217;s a logical outcome and I think the manipulation angle is way overblown. It&#8217;s just the growth outlook people, no need to complicate things.</p>

<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, this is exactly the argument people used as Microsoft started to stall. Indeed, the same argument was used when RIM had a fat bank account and people started pointing out coming troubles.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have lots of money, therefore success is assured.&#8221;</p>
<p>Does anyone think Apple isn&#8217;t trying? That they aren&#8217;t beating their heads trying to make a wearable or home entertainment solution that will be the next trillion dollar product?

<p>Apple might do great things, or they might not. But having a big bank account in no way guarantees anything.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-58796" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>The concept of luxury in the IT market in recent. Even early Macs were not so much luxury items as hardware+software UFOs. The fact that Apple are alone in that niche doesn&#8217;t help legitimatizing it either (is that a word ? It is in French but the English version looks weird).<br />
I&#8217;m guessing Wall Street will catch on once the iPhone situation is stabilized (having a product at 50% market share in some markets, and at 10% in other similar markets rises questions), and if/when another or two luxury suppliers (Microsoft ? Nah, they&#8217;ll lose their nerve and go for volume) pop up.</p>

During the last 16 years, PCs have been utterly driven by the Wintel consortium, both of which grew an already-huge market share. That&#8217;s the antithesis of commoditization (where all sellers offer an utterly undifferentiated product). Pretty clearly, the mother board&#8217;s support chips, memory chips, disk drives and other components also came from extremely competitive, but leapfrogging firms. Finally, the nameplate is not a commodity either, as customers latch onto brands for signals about quality and value, too.</p>
<p>Net-net: no, consumers still actively choose brand and features in PCs.</p>
<p><i>“Apple being a premium brand don&#8217;t participate in the race to the bottom, but what really surprises me is that no PC maker (Sony tried with Vaio line) was able to at least step in the range between the bottom feeders and Apple.”</i></p>
<p>Half of selling PCs is selling thru what Jobs called “orifices” at Enterprises—the IT mavens (a phrase that had to have been calculated to insult). Especially in early years, a lot of home purchasers used PCs in their day jobs and worked with similar hardware at home. Sony, which at the checkbox level had undifferentiated products and higher prices, was disadvantaged.</p>
<p>One of the early comments I heard from Cook was that Apple acted as a Systems Integrator with its products, whereas buying components off the shelf explicitly requires that expertise by the buyer, and even a lot of the “will this printer work with this version of Windows on this hardware” questions required expertise/access that most individuals don&#8217;t have—and that Sony, as a niche player, imposed <b>more</b> angst on their customers. I agree that the Sony hardware was always beautiful, but there were always the nagging questions about compatibility, availability of replacement parts, etc. Quality of a consumer product is a lot more than a well-built, attractive design.</p>

On average the market isn&#8217;t wrong, so unless apple creates/buys new categories then their margins will deteriorate . That said when the market is wrong, it can be by a lot. The market doesn&#8217;t know what it doesn&#8217;t know, so they can&#8217;t really price unseen innovation, but right now they don&#8217;t seem to be overly impressed with Cooke. Cooke and jobs were dynamite. Cooke and Ive are still to be determined, but so far we&#8217;ve seen a lot of petty politics and continued evolution of successful products( a few I own ).  The reality to me are macs like iPhones  are a niche and very profitable market.<br />
To me pc video cards are sort of similar. Nvda has been able to carve out a niche out of a market that most people don&#8217;t care about. Frankly , if there is one lesson apple has taught is that you don&#8217;t always need the most market share, just the most profitable. Further, consumers aren&#8217;t stupid at the High end and they won&#8217;t buy crap. On average apples products have higher costing components, artisan like craftsmanship, at a bargain price( relatively) that tempts most even if they can&#8217;t afford or justify it. Cooke gets this and the data you show is consequence not a predictor or cause . </p>

This is not something that gets proven by some thesis on stock valuation. One big debate is really growth vs value, can apple continue to grow the top line. Any way i think as a user of apple products, which I am, and i think this is particularly important given that at the end of the day, we/ i am the target market, at what point do i believe that i&#8217;ve got the ultimate phone. That maybe i don&#8217;t even want a phone at all. What if someone else creates this future or if the market just stagnates and all these things are just commoditized pieces of glass and silicon. Why will apple be able to keep their margins/sales in such a future? This is the future that google is trying to create and it is an eminent threat to apple as the premium device (bauble ) maker in the world.</p>

<p>Anyway, if what&#8217;s important is the future, there is no indication that the Mac will deteriorate that much. It hasn&#8217;t in the past few years, and there is nothing major that&#8217;s coming that might change that. Wearables certainly aren&#8217;t going to disrupt it.</p>
<p>So again, if you say that we don&#8217;t know what the future holds, the most reasonable thing to expect is that Apple&#8217;s margins won&#8217;t deteriorate, not the contrary, unless you have evidence that it might.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-58870" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I hear your point. The question is this perhaps. Is the iPhone the iPod? nothing last forever. The valuations imply it is. Let me give you another example, I for one got upset years ago that i paid for text separate than data on my at&amp;t phone plan. I thought about things like ting.com and I eventually switched to tmobile, partly because i was just tired of being had and partly because tmobile was providing a credible alternative for my usage habits. Mind you I had at&amp;t since the first iPhone.  This business is worth billions to the major telcos, at least in the US. Now it is interesting that with iMessage apple attacked this high margin business from telecom companies like at&amp;t by providing a free alternative, but only if I both users are on apple devices. Let&#8217;s also not forget that the original plans on the iPhone supposedly had envisaged a future without the wireless telecoms. Fast forward to last week and FB buys whatsapp (texting for free essentially ) for 16b and people can&#8217;t understand the valuation. In other words, users didn&#8217;t really want to pay for something they can get for essentially free or that they were double paying for (text is data or the world is data ). I argue that all technology evolves to commodity more or less and the margins will erode. We&#8217;re just not be able to tell right away where the substation effect is going to come from. Another personal story is I have close and young member of my family ( a millennial ) and texting is far more important than voice as a medium of communication. In what&#8217;s app it seems fb bought a telecom co for cheap. If your telecom wireless provider, you ought to wonder at what point will people eventually stop paying for text. It was the golden goose that they milked for too long.</p>

Lloyd chambers does a pretty good job of pointing out crucial technical areas where apple keeps dropping the ball. I am photographer when it suits me, and i have about a terabyte of photos that i think i would like to manage and edit on the new mac pro, which is exceptional hardware, barring the storage limitation, but Lloyd has been making the case for some time that apple is dropping the ball on osx. At some point if the core is rotting the bottom line will fall out.</p>

Yes, like the cliche from sam savage&#8217;s book, ( the flaw of averages ), plans made on average on average fail, i am not actually trying to make a qualitative statement on apple based on an average. And if i did, which average did I use for you to disagree with? An average is a number by definition and I gave no numbers&#8230;I did not say that apple is not exceptional or that they are not profitable above the norm, or that Cooke/Jobs have found a clever and obvious way to make them insane amounts of profits partially thru global wage arbitrage. What i am saying is that in generally, I respect the market, and more times than not, it is right. If they are right, what does it really say about apples future or their enthusiasm on unreleased products. I am also from the Munger side when it comes to predicting the future prospects of a company. That is management matters, and that there is a lack of buy in by the market on Tum Cooke as the future of apple. These are my opinions, take it for what it&#8217;s worth.</p>

Are you saying that the average, because it is the average, is necessarily right?  You realize that the market can be wrong all the time and yet on average it is right, don&#8217;t you?  And that presupposes we have some way of knowing what is right.  I think what you mean is the market gets it right once it is able to look backwards, but that&#8217;s not exactly the critical perspective, right?  It&#8217;s looking ahead where all the interesting action is.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-58817" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Horace, you can&#8217;t label the &#8220;Mac Volume&#8221; with &#8220;millions of units&#8221; while having descriptor numbers on the y-axis like this. Right now that graph gives the number of macs in Q4/2013 as 50,000 millions of units. That would be 50,000,000,000 Macs.</p>
<p>Even if you take the y-axis description in the European sense of the comma, it would still be 50 million Macs.</p>
<p>If I&#8217;m not wrong you want to depict millions (as you described it). The correct way would be to label it &#8220;Mac Volume (hundreds of units)&#8221; since 100 times 50,000 is 5 million.</p>
<p>Oh and as always: nothings you write here considers earnings. I mean it&#8217;s neat that a Mac is three times as expensive as a regular PC but that says nothing about the earnings per Unit. I mean we all THINK we know how much the Chinese makers of those cheap PCs make, but do we REALLY know? No we don&#8217;t. Our gut feelings tell us that Apple earns more per Mac than a maker of regular PCs but then again Apple&#8217;s share prices are dictated by gut feelings as well so&#8230; ah whatever&#8230; </p>
<p>It&#8217;s just curious that you keep banging the &#8220;revenue&#8221; drum like crazy when in the end what counts is earnings. And you don&#8217;t talk about earnings. At all. All the time.</p>
<p>Yet every time Amazon is criticized here and elsewhere, you chide them for not being profitable. </p>
<p>But uh, look at those revenues! HUGE! REVENUES!</p>
<p>But again, whatever. I mean 91 comments and not one noticed that labeling error. It&#8217;s as if all your readers care about is numbers. You kind of have to question the way people read your site if you ask me. To be honest to me it feels like watching people watch Fox News or something. They want something to be true and there are graphs so hey &#8211; awesome. My preconceived notion is affirmed so everything I just read is awesome.</p>
<p>I mean the sheer fact alone that the &#8220;30 year old mac&#8221; was also there in 97 when the company nearly went bust&#8230; ah whatever. Everything&#8217;s awesome so Macs are awesome. </p>
<p>Awesome.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-58854" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Couple of points</p>
<p>1) I think Horace read what I wrote and then deleted so he knows it<br />
2) if you&#8217;d read my blog you&#8217;d know your remarks regarding that are moot<br />
3) if you think that the price of a Mac then and now doesn&#8217;t have anything to do with the topic then *drumroll* THERE YOU GO. Exactly what I was getting at. There&#8217;s no way anyone who&#8217;s reading Asymco is going to spend any time actually thinking about critically comments because<br />
10 Horace is right<br />
20 goto 10</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I deleted my comment. You&#8217;re not going to even try to think about my statement about the price of Macs back then and now. How hard was that to get anyway? Macs have been priced at a 2 to 2.5 ratio to regular PCs back when Apple was close to going bust and they are priced the same way today. How that is NOT pertaining to the friggin blog post is beyond me.</p>
<p>The differene between then and now is not that the price is actually right but that just like Breitling watches or Porsche 911s, Apple Macs have ALWAYS been priced like this and always will be priced like this because Apple is selling a brand and that brand needs to have the feeling of being something higher class. That&#8217;s not a criticism of Apple but to me it&#8217;s a given. Saying that today the &#8220;price is right&#8221; to me is&#8230; I don&#8217;t even know what it is&#8230; it feels like looking at data and desperately trying to find a narrative for a blog post and then hammering the data into the right form so people can look at it and go &#8220;Wow, he&#8217;s right&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like going to church or to a card reader in the way that you already know what you want to here and lo and behold here you get it. Exactly what you want &#8211; the feeling that the product is priced right because look at the data &#8211; people are buying in droves.</p>
<p>To me, the price ISN&#8217;T what the data reflects. That is my whole point. To me, the data reflects the changes in the company in that FINALLY after decades of putting mediocre products for the price on the market, with OS X and Laptops with an insane running time (battery life), FINALLY the products fit the bill of these prices. &#8220;Caring about the product&#8221; also isn&#8217;t a factor to me. I just don&#8217;t see the data fitting ANYTHING of what Horace wrote but hey, that&#8217;s just me actually thinking about the topic at hand.</p>
<p>Oh and another angle would be that people are buying Macs because they never would&#8217;ve thought about getting one if not for their iOS devices but what do I know. Something Gruber said three years ago.</p>
<p>But hey colorful graph is colorful. So data. Much impress.</p>

<p>Apparently cheng read what I wrote in the first three minutes it was online and chose to comment. </p>
<p>Most of it is now in the answers to cheng, the &#8220;5000 Million = 5,000,000,000&#8243; bit is about the graph which has the number of Macs as &#8220;millions of units&#8221;. With the vertical axis being labeled &#8220;thousands of units&#8221; and the graph showing the number of Macs sold being between 1,000 and 5,000 following graph labeling conventions this would mean there were up to 5,000 &#8220;millions of units&#8221; sold and 5,000 millions is 5,000,000 * 5,000 and that&#8217;s 5,000,000,000</p>

This is a misinterpretation of the law of commoditisation. It is also a complete misinterpretation of Apple&#8217;s business model: Apple isn&#8217;t just a hardware manufacturer. The iOS and OSX ecosystems are Apple&#8217;s products, not hardware. Apple is the only company on earth that sells these clearly differentiated products while the rest sell hardware. They are thus alone in their market, commoditisation does not apply and your data is moot. Apple does not sell a homogenous product and thus they are more akin to a monopoly when it comes to market forces. Furthermore, looking at a graph about the averages in the hardware market while discussing Apple is misguided at best. We all know Apple doesn&#8217;t sell average products they sell premium products. Therefore if you DO insist on comparing them to this market, you should compare them to the premium segment of the market only. I don&#8217;t have the data on hand, but I&#8217;m sure if you compare them to only Alienware or only Samsung&#8217;s flagship devices the graphs will match up more closely. I really feel you should make sure you understand the fundamentals of market laws better if you plan on writing articles about market trends. These concepts are explained well in University level Economics classes worldwide. </p>

For example, brands like Coach and Gucci swim in their own markets because they target a different segment of the buying public than their &#8220;common folk&#8221; counterparts. So trying to draw similarities consumer trends between them is comparing apples and oranges &#8211; they aren&#8217;t necessarily competing for the same consumers. And we know for example, that luxury brands are NOT following the same market trends as &#8220;common folk brands&#8221; as luxury brands are doing quite well because the wealthy are doing quite well, unlike the &#8220;common folk&#8221; space.</p>
<p>So kyron you have it backwards &#8211; it&#8217;s not about Apple&#8217;s business strategy (ecosystem or hardware) its about the _product_ people are buying.  And in the case of Apple, it IS the ecosystem that that Apple has produced that people are buying into. That is people aren&#8217;t buying just the hardware, they&#8217;re buying into the whole Apple ecosystem. And that&#8217;s a different type market than people who just buy a piece of PC hardware. And where the product and market is &#8220;the Apple ecosystem&#8221; that is distinct from PC hardware, then yes Apple is a monopolist in that market. If you want to buy into the Apple ecosystem as a product, there&#8217;s only one game in town and that&#8217;s Apple. If you want to buy in the PC market there are a number of players to choose from.</p>

<p>Well, of course, commoditization doesn&#8217;t just happen because of time; it is caused by producers seeing an opportunity to gain business by producing an undifferentiated commodity. But especially in a business with rapidly-changing tech, businesses have to learn how to produce the new state-of-the-art products, design them, and ramp up production. All that takes time, so commoditization happens over time.</p>
<p>Or maybe I&#8217;m misinterpreting what you call the “law of commoditisation.” — Google dished up articles about commodities law and “how to keep your law practice from being commoditized” so please feel to express what this law represents if NOT the notion that disruptive changes are eventually suffused through an industry.</p>
<p>So no wonder you&#8217;re exasperated that we don&#8217;t get it: you&#8217;ve skipped the point you think we should understand.</p>

<p>To put my point a bit more succinctly and without all the snarkiness: 1) New markets tend to become commodity markets over time, that does not mean Apple is competing in this commoditised hardware market by default. 2) Apple alone sells their ecosystem. The market behaviour proves that customers believe this is a clearly differentiated product alone in its own market 3) Thus all the market behaviour around Apple products is completely normal and not breaking any rules or universal laws, as Apple should be analysed as a Monopolistic company not as a company competing in a commoditised market.</p>

The Windows PC as a whole remains more profitable than the PC manufacturers&#8217; numbers belie.  It&#8217;s just that the profits are siphoned off by Microsoft.  Yes prices of Windows PCs have been on a steep downward trend but this is mostly from the vicious, cutthroat competition among the hardware manufacturers.  What is the trend on the price of Windows itself?</p>
<p>We should also note that Apple fends off downward price pressure by ramping up hardware specs.  e.g. Instead of cutting prices, they&#8217;ll raise the RAM or storage, or shift from HDs to SSDs.</p>

<p><b>IF</b> Microsoft gets $80 per OEM Windows license (and IIRC the number might be half that) and <b>IF</b> they&#8217;re still in the stratospheric 90%+ gross margin, then that&#8217;s $72 per device — tops.</p>
<p>In contrast, we see the Mac at around $1250 ASP, with Horace&#8217;s estimate of 26% gross margin, yielding $325 per device.</p>
<p>Microsoft may be capturing all the PC profitability, and at its huge 90%+ share of the desktop, that&#8217;s a huge business. But on a per-unit basis, the PC yields less than a quarter of the profitability.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure why you think it relevant that Macs regularly get spec upgrades. You simply can&#8217;t buy, because nobody bothers to build, a desktop machine with leading-edge specs from 2004. A simple glance at the weekend ads from Best Buy shows i5 or i7 processors, multi-GB RAM, etc., that was too expensive a few years back, but that customers now find worth the modest extra expense.</p>

To the extent that they are very similar for a given level of quality, there should be no reason to add those to one platform but not another.</p>
<p>The story still stands: 13% of a $600 PC is a quarter of 26% of a $1250 Mac. Add in the little gross margin at the manufacturers, and it&#8217;s still a lopsided contrast.</p>
