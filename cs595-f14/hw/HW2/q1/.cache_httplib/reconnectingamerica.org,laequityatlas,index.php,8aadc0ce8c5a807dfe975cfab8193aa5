</div>
      <p class="intro-copy">By 2014, five additional new light rail and subway lines will be under construction across Los Angeles County, part of an unprecedented regional transit expansion unrivaled in the 21st Century in the United States. With a $40 billion voter-approved transit investment being deployed over the next 20 years, along with other critical investments, Los Angeles County residents have decided to chart a path to a new future, redefining how we live, how we move, and how the rest of the world sees and experiences Los Angeles County.</p>

<p class="intro-copy">So, what does equity mean in relation to this $40 billion transit investment? In this future Los Angeles, we want to embrace the incredible cultural and racial diversity that makes Los Angeles one of the most dynamic and entrepreneurial places in the world, while also acknowledging that the majority of the people who contribute to that dynamism make up households that are predominantly low and moderate income.</p>

<div style="width:100%; text-align:center;">
  <img src="images/transpotoworkbyincome.jpg" width="900" height="285" alt="Transportation to Work by Worker Income Level"/> </div>
<p class="intro-copy">Today, workers earning less than $25,000 a year now make up 71% of the commute to work trips on the existing transit system.<sup><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup>  While we need to grow transit ridership to capture the benefit of this major new investment, this cannot be done at the expense of “core transit riders” who are already using the system.</p>

<p class="intro-copy">The Equity Atlas draws from existing research and material to understand geographic differences in performance towards achieving the countywide equity goals outlined in the report. The Equity Atlas clearly articulates how these goals related to transportation and land use investments. The Equity Atlas overlays the transit network on different measures to understand how we perform as a county today, and to help identify the key gaps and assets in individual communities, along corridors, or in station areas along the frequent transit lines.</p>

<h2>How to read this Atlas</h2>
<p class="intro-copy">The Atlas has been designed to be a reference document, where a reader can understand basic facts about any given issue facing the transit network in a consistent format. Each of the major themes is broken into six unique outcomes, each with its own set of data, maps, and recommendations.</p>

<p class="intro-copy">The <a href="20131101-laequityatlas-final.pdf" target="_blank">Atlas document</a> includes the following information for each outcome. </p>

			<h3>Chapter 1 Maps A: Increasing Mobility, Access, and Connectivity</h3>
		   <div class="accordion-content">
           	  <p class="intro-copy">One of the biggest issues for low and moderate-income families in Los Angeles County is the cost of living.  Not only is housing in Los Angeles County expensive but so is the cost of transportation.  Creating a system where transportation costs are lower is important for all transit riders, especially low and moderate income households in the region who spend a greater proportion of their income on transportation. The $40 billion transit investment represents a meaningful opportunity to build the system in a way that benefits all users, especially low income and transit dependent riders.</p>

<p class="intro-copy">An important equity outcome would be to increase the number of households that are benefitting from investments that connect low and moderate income riders to major transportation access points and key destinations such as jobs, schools and daycare.  This means bike and pedestrian infrastructure as well as high quality and high frequency bus service that make access to destinations easier and more affordable.  Additionally, not every community will be able to support greater transit investments, but it is important to consider how mobility can be improved for people in all parts of the County.</p>

			<h3>Chapter 2 Maps B: Preserving and Creating Affordable Housing and Managing Neighborhood Change</h3>
			<div class="accordion-content">
            	<p class="intro-copy">Providing housing that is affordable to people of all incomes is a fundamental tenent of building more equitable and sustainable communities and regions. By 2035, the region is expected to add four million people, a majority of them non-white. The best way to ensure that these new residents do not contribute to an increase in congestion and worsen air quality with their transportation choices or lack thereof, is to provide opportunities for them to live in locations that offer other mobility options other than the car. The data shows that households living near transit today are more than twice as likely to take transit to work than the average household, with transit ridership being much higher among very-low and low-income residents in the County.</p> 

<p class="intro-copy">SCAG has forecasted that 40% of the 624,000 new households projected by 2035 (or 250,000 households) will need housing affordable to very-low and low incomes.  Therefore we need to focus on ensuring that current housing opportunities for low income people in transit rich communities are preserved, and that new housing near transit meets the needs of people at a range of incomes.</p>

			<h3>Chapter 4 Maps D: Investing in Healthy Communities</h3>
			<div class="accordion-content">
            <p class="intro-copy">As more is learned about the connection between the built environment and public health, actionable steps need to be taken to influence the factors that have the most impact on improving health outcomes such as lowering risks of injury from collisions, eliminating pollution that contributes to chronic disease and returning physical activity into our daily lives.</p> 
 
<p class="intro-copy">Creating environments for walking and biking that are safe are important activities that can influence health outcomes. Improving access to fresh food and supportive amenities such as parks can reduce health problems and lower health care costs for families as well as government. Health care facility access and better air quality are important as well.  Freeways and other sources of pollution like industrial areas trigger higher rates of childhood asthma and other health impacts for those living nearby.  Action should be taken to ensure low-income residents are not disproportionately impacted by stationary and mobile sources of pollution.  Finally these communities should be safe. Crime and violence is a major health issue, with premature death and debilitating injuries leading to losses in productivity and family stress, which place a large burden on the health care and social service system.</p>

<p id="recommendations" class="intro-copy">The accordions below contain a full list of the recommendations described in each of the Outcome sheets of the Atlas, with identification of potential responsible parties who could implement each recommendation. Collectively this list includes 72 recommendations (3 each for 24 outcomes). However many of these recommendations are interrelated, and generally boil down into four key themes:
<ol class="intro-copy">
<li>Be mindful about how transit routes are aligned, to connect residents of greatest need (and with the greatest potential to take transit) with valuable work, education, recreational and service destinations;</li>
<li>Be purposeful about making supporting investments in infrastructure, development, programming and services to prioritize areas near transit, and communities with gaps and needs. The Equity Atlas as a document with specific information about individual neighborhoods can help inform policies;</li>
<li>Be innovative in considering new financing mechanisms, implementation strategies, and policies to expand affordable housing, services, and local infrastructure to fill gaps in communities;</li>
<li>Be coordinated in implementation by prioritizing key geographies and investments, identifying potential assets such as public agency land, timing changes in regulations (e.g. higher densities, reduced parking, smaller building footprints) with actions such as land banking, development, or financing new uses, and working across agencies and sectors.</li>
