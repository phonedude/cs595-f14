     <p>By <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jawbone.com">Hosain Rahman</a>, CEO of Jawbone &amp; sf.citi Board Member, and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ymcasf.org/">Chuck Collins</a>, President and CEO of the YMCA <br /> <br></p>

<p>April 14, 2014 - <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/default/article/We-need-a-one-city-approach-in-San-Francisco-5399544.php" target="_blank">San Francisco Chronicle</a><br />
When tech companies and social service organizations met recently at City Hall, we expected the meeting to expose some of the tensions we had been reading about in the press - you know the story: corporate shuttle buses attacked, millionaires' homes targeted while thousands of hard-working city dwellers struggle to find affordable housing.
<br><br>
But the truth is we have much more in common than not.
<br><br>
For example, one attendee said she relied upon the services of the Boys & Girls Club when, after high school, she found herself homeless. Today she is the vice president of engineering for a San Francisco tech company. Another argued that we could use our world-class skills in data analysis to better understand, and help solve, the problem. This was not the argument of a data scientist, but of the leader of a large social service organization.
<br><br>
The meeting produced no silver-bullet solutions. But being in the same room together allowed us to share our hopes and our experiences, renew our appreciation for each other, and realize that if we are going to tackle some of the city's most pressing issues, then we will have to establish stronger and more effective partnerships.
<br><br>
In short, we concluded that we need a "one city" approach.
<br><br>
We need closer collaboration to reach our shared goals. Instead of standing on opposite sides of an imaginary line drawn in the sand, tech workers and members of the larger community need to sit around a table together - just as our organizations did at the request of Mayor Ed Lee and urging of tech organization sf.citi.
<br><br>
That is not a new idea.
<br><br>
San Francisco businesses have always partnered with community service organizations to bring about positive change. Throughout its history, which long predates the tech industry, the YMCA's commitment to healthy children has required the collective efforts of the whole city working together.
<br><br>
The tech industry, however, is a relatively new sector, and many of the tech companies based here are only a few years old. We acknowledge that building a culture of community service inside companies takes time and effort - but we know the opportunity is now and the potential is enormous. It's a goal we are committed to working toward together.
<br><br>
What are our shared goals? Each of our communities wants the character of San Francisco to remain intact. Each wants to reduce poverty here and make the city a place where middle-class families can survive. Each wants the local economy to thrive. A "one city" approach can help us accomplish those goals.
<br><br>
Jawbone understands that its employees have the power to positively influence the city we all call home. It and other tech companies can reach for that goal by engaging with the local community. Some have already begun to - such as Zynga, which mobilizes its workforce to build playgrounds and community gardens, and sf.citi, which is working to support schools that have large populations of students from disadvantaged backgrounds.
<br><br>
Better collaboration needs to take place, too, among nonprofits. Developing a common set of metrics among social service organizations will go a long way toward meeting our shared goals. Will we define success as fewer homeless San Franciscans, a reduced number of evictions, a healthier population, or better educated young people?
<br><br>
Nearly three dozen individuals attended this meeting, representing both the tech and service communities.
<br><br>
Community organizations outlined what they believe are the most pressing challenges facing San Francisco: workforce development, the technology gap for children growing up in poverty, the need for additional units of affordable housing. Representatives of tech companies offered ideas about how they believe they can be most effective in helping to address those needs.
<br><br>
We committed to take on some immediate tasks, together. Top of the list: helping to prevent families from being evicted in San Francisco by advocating in support of state Sen. Mark Leno's legislation to reform the Ellis Act.
<br><br>
Another example is Senate Bill 391, which seeks to restore hundreds of millions of dollars in state funding for new affordable housing. It sits dormant in the state Assembly Appropriations Committee, but we believe our collective voice can be powerful in moving this bill through the Legislature for the benefit of San Francisco and other cities.
<br><br>
We're also going to explore ways data analytics can help community service organizations use their resources even more effectively.
<br><br>
This is just a start. As we learn to work together, we're certain that new ideas and new projects will emerge - as will new challenges. We may just be getting to know one another but we have the same goals for our city and we'll be reaching for them with a "one city" approach.</p>
