hooligan&#39;s death sparks a week of debate and navel-gazing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;A dark cloud passed over Spanish football last weekend as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/soccerphile/players/lionel-messi.html&quot;&gt;Lionel Messi&lt;/a&gt; was struck on the head by a bottle&amp;nbsp;hurled from the stands in Valencia as he celebrated Barcelona’s winner, while over in Madrid a man was killed in a fight between hooligans attached to Atletico Madrid and Deportivo La Coruna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ROht2jWnMik/VIOqmjnl5ZI/AAAAAAAAicM/VRRIQb733Y8/s1600/calderon.jpg&quot;

/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Messi left the Mestalla bruised but not wounded by the plastic missile and the club have vowed to find and ban the offender. Meanwhile the media has gone into soul-searching meltdown over the hooligan&#39;s death, helped by the fact hazy video footage captured the moment when Atletico thugs dropped their Deportivo counterpart into the Manzanares river following a battering to his skull.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Approximately 200 Atletico thugs battled 80 hooligans predominantly from La Coruna, with some help from groups attached to Alcorcon and Rayo Vallecano. The nominal clash was political - Frente Atletico being right-wing and the Riazor Blues from the left. Twelve further fans were injured and 24 arrested when the police showed up.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;In English terms, the debate here seems to be positioned circa 1990, when a decade and a half of serious violence had led to several conclusions being drawn, most notably that it was near-impossible to detach hooliganism any further from football.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;It has been a blast from the past hearing calls for more CCTV within stadia, a debate which resounded around England around the mid-1980s and the nadir of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/soccerphile/news/sean/heysel.html&quot;&gt;Heysel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Once British thugs had been expelled from stadia and their environs by intense policing, they took to taking down each other&#39;s numbers and arranging punch-ups between each other in isolated locations, as happened in Madrid.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The only remaining connections with the sport were that the gangs identified themselves with teams and their fights took place on match days.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;As in England, the hooligan scene here is pathetic from a distance, an ugly spectacle of grown men stuck in the mentality of the school playground. The death of the Deportivo thug crossed the line of ultra culture of course. His ilk go to fight and not to kill, which explains why the top boys from the various groupings have each other’s phone numbers on speed dial. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;These are not top-drawer criminals, who kill without qualms or the preamble of an arranged set-to. Like the protagonists of Chuck Palahniuk&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Fight Club&lt;/i&gt;, they are grown men lacking something in their lives and who make up for it with a bloody punch-up in private. This is not a footballing problem beyond the fact the fixtures calendar gives the police a clue to forthcoming scraps.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Sunday’s fatal clash in Madrid happened 300 metres away from Atletico’s Vicente Calderon ground but was planned using &lt;i&gt;WhatsApp&lt;/i&gt; and took place at eight-thirty on a Sunday morning, so to centre the blame on the sport must be wide of the mark. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;More than one press outlet referred to the hooligans as ‘aficionados’ (fans) of the clubs, which is an insult to genuine supporters, who have no wish to stain the name of their team in that way.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The dead man was not a season-ticket holder and possibly had no intention of going to the match, at noon.&amp;nbsp;Some of the arrested thugs had match tickets in their pockets but many did not.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Add the fact that he was 43 years old and had convictions for violence, abuse and drug-dealing, was married with two children, yet travelled 600 km with dozens of like-minded men for pre-match entertainment on a Sunday morning involving baseball bats and iron bars, makes it hard to feel much sympathy.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;While it is not always possible for the average fan to avoid the effects of football hooliganism, this victim clearly went looking for it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Questions have been asked about the police’s failure to pre-empt the confrontation of course (they had deemed the match low-risk), while the football authorities have been encouragingly quick to promise a clampdown on the ultra culture. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Atletico have said the ‘Frente Atletico’ will no longer be allowed to enter the stadium, while the Riazor Blues are debating disbanding following the tragedy. The 88 identified participants in the riot have been slapped with €60,000 fines and five-year stadium bans.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The league and federation have spoken of deducting points and closing stadia of clubs who co-operate in future with ultra groupings, although it remains to be seen if the ultras will vanish.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;One familiar absence from the debate has been the much-criticised head of the Spanish Federation &amp;amp; FIFA Ex.Co. member Angel Maria Villar Llona, whose silence has been depressing, if not unexpected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align=&quot;center&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;tr-caption-container&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SSU86YrVteo/VIOvNOjZ5PI/AAAAAAAAicY/yfR-lhJ9FLA/s1600/calderon-2.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Area around the Vicente Calderon Stadium.&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SSU86YrVteo/VIOvNOjZ5PI/AAAAAAAAicY/yfR-lhJ9FLA/s1600/calderon-2.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Area around the Vicente Calderon Stadium&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;tr-caption&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Area around the Vicente Calderon Stadium&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Spanish stadia appear similar to Italian ones and unlike English ones with their organised fan groupings, and some gangs, the Ultras Sur of Real Madrid and Barcelona’s Boixos Nois for example, seem every bit as fierce as the worst of Serie A, but the overall tone of Spanish fandom is less harsh than in Italy.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Football is fairly peaceful in Spain. An Athletic Bilbao fan died two years ago when his team played Schalke in the Champions League, but it has been 11 years since a Spaniard died at a game involving two domestic teams. There were three deaths in the 1980s and five in the &#39;90s by comparison.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;One can only hope this moment is a watershed and that the military-style groups clinging to clubs like parasites with their irrelevant political posturings, are flushed down the toilet in Spain forever. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;(c) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/soccerphile/columnists/sean-oconor.html&quot;&gt;Sean O&#39;Conor&lt;/a&gt;

The 36-year-old scored in Wednesday&#39;s 3-0 victory over Tottenham and continues to show that Mourinho was right to bring him back to Stamford Bridge following his spells in China and Turkey. &quot;It&#39;s remarkable,&quot; said the Blues boss. &quot;I was expecting exactly this. The important thing is that he&#39;s here and he&#39;s going to finish his career with Chelsea. &quot;It looks, for me, that he&#39;s going to stay doing other things when he finishes his career.&quot; Chelsea, 1/4 with bet365 to win the Premier League title outright, are 7/1 to remain unbeaten in the league this season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/11/georgespremiership-predictions-november.html&quot;&gt;Last time&#39;s predictions&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/feeds/8373342832067520972/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7424337262078805962&amp;postID=8373342832067520972' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/8373342832067520972'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/8373342832067520972'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/12/georges-premiership-predictions.html' title='George&#39;s Premiership Predictions December 6 2014'/><author><name>Soccerphile</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='6' src='http://bp3.blogger.com/_USzog_GOzyA/R-enhnyI37I/AAAAAAAADcs/gy7OPVaMJSY/S220/japan-visitor-logo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7424337262078805962.post-3307409938654825123</id><published>2014-11-28T13:00:00.003Z</published><updated>2014-12-05T13:03:07.022Z</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Betting"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="English Premier League"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="football betting"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Predictions"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Premiership"/><title type='text'>George&#39;s Premiership Predictions November 29 2014</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href=&quot;http://imstore.bet365affiliates.com/Tracker.aspx?AffiliateId=3771&amp;amp;AffiliateCode=365_027632&amp;amp;CID=358&amp;amp;PID=149&amp;amp;TID=3&amp;amp;LNG=1&amp;amp;DID=27&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;bet365&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://imstore.bet365affiliates.com/?AffiliateCode=365_027632&amp;amp;CID=358&amp;amp;PID=149&amp;amp;LNG=1&amp;amp;TID=3&amp;amp;DID=27&quot; title=&quot;bet365&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;George had a mixed week last week correctly predicting the score of Hull v Spurs and Everton v West Ham plus home wins for Chelsea, Newcastle and Man City.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saturday, 29 November 2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;West Brom 0 v Arsenal 2&lt;br /&gt;Burnley 1 v Aston Villa 0&lt;br /&gt;Liverpool 1 v Stoke 0&lt;br /&gt;Man Utd 2 v Hull 0&lt;br /&gt;QPR 2 v Leicester 0&lt;br /&gt;Swansea 1 v Crystal Palace 0&lt;br /&gt;West Ham 2 v Newcastle 2&lt;br /&gt;Sunderland 0 v Chelsea 2&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunday 30 November 2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Southampton 0 v Man City 2&lt;br /&gt;Tottenham 1 v Everton 1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Man City 10/11 To Qualify – 11/8 To Finish Bottom!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Champions League qualification from Group E will be going to the wire with bet365 asking where Manchester City will finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sergio Aguero inspired side are 10/11 to nab the all-important second spot, 6/1 to finish third and end up in the Europa League and 11/8 to finish bottom of the pile after their comeback against runaway group leaders Bayern Munich on Tuesday night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bet365&#39;s Steve Freeth &quot;A roller coaster of a night at the Etihad would have had Man City In-Play backers (biggest price 50/1) cheering Aguero to the rafters and if we&#39;ve done our maths correctly, they now go into Matchday 6 at odds-on to qualify.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2014/15 Champions League Group E&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where Will Manchester City Finish&lt;br /&gt;2nd 10/11 3rd 6/1 4th 11/8&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To Qualify&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Man City 10/11 Roma Evs CSKA Moscow 16/1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soccer - Allen confident of Champions League progress&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liverpool midfielder Joe Allen is pleased that the team&#39;s Champions League hopes are still in their own hands going into the final group game against Basel. The Reds can still reach the last-16 despite Wednesday&#39;s 2-2 draw with Ludogorets in Sofia which means they have only won one of their five Group B encounters. However, Liverpool will qualify for the knockout stages of the competition if they beat Basel at Anfield next month. &quot;It&#39;s still in our hands and that&#39;s a big bonus for us,&quot; Allen said. &quot;We all believe we can do it. We&#39;re at Anfield and we&#39;ll be calling on all our supporters to get behind us and make it a seriously tough night for Basel.&quot; Liverpool entertain Stoke City at Anfield on Saturday in the Premier League and are 15/2 with bet365 to win the match 2-0. They can be backed at 4/7 to qualify for the last-16 of the Champions League.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/11/georges-premiership-predictions_21.html&quot;&gt;Last time&#39;s predictions&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/feeds/3307409938654825123/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7424337262078805962&amp;postID=3307409938654825123' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/3307409938654825123'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/3307409938654825123'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/11/georgespremiership-predictions-november.html' title='George&#39;s Premiership Predictions November 29 2014'/><author><name>Soccerphile</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='6' src='http://bp3.blogger.com/_USzog_GOzyA/R-enhnyI37I/AAAAAAAADcs/gy7OPVaMJSY/S220/japan-visitor-logo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7424337262078805962.post-773728225299318887</id><published>2014-11-27T15:28:00.000Z</published><updated>2014-11-27T15:29:02.435Z</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="England FIFA Ranking"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Fifa World Rankings"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="world rankings"/><title type='text'>Fifa World Rankings November 2014</title><content type='html'>&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pYYDc0SabEw/UbByb2DLTDI/AAAAAAAAdn8/TonfgSojRhQ/s1600/fifa-rankings2.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;FIFA World Fifa Rankings&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pYYDc0SabEw/UbByb2DLTDI/AAAAAAAAdn8/TonfgSojRhQ/s200/fifa-rankings2.jpg&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; title=&quot;FIFA World Fifa Rankings&quot; width=&quot;177&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Fifa&#39;s World Rankings for November 2014 were published today at FIFA HQ in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/soccerphile/euro2008/city_guide/zurich.html&quot;&gt;Zurich&lt;/a&gt;, Switzerland.

There are a lot of games to play in the Premier League and Champions League. &quot;We have 27 more games to play and there are a lot of points (to be contested), so we will see at the end who will be the best team this year.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/11/georges-premiership-predictions.html&quot;&gt;Last time&#39;s predictions&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/feeds/6490624144807331070/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7424337262078805962&amp;postID=6490624144807331070' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/6490624144807331070'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/6490624144807331070'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/11/georges-premiership-predictions_21.html' title='George&#39;s Premiership Predictions November 22 2014'/><author><name>Soccerphile</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='6' src='http://bp3.blogger.com/_USzog_GOzyA/R-enhnyI37I/AAAAAAAADcs/gy7OPVaMJSY/S220/japan-visitor-logo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7424337262078805962.post-2129295450495011977</id><published>2014-11-18T22:57:00.003Z</published><updated>2014-11-27T12:44:24.427Z</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="cristiano ronaldo"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="international friendlies"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Leo Messi"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Old Trafford"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Sean O&#39;Conor"/><title type='text'>Friendly fire</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2Y2kBtsLzpw/VHU7heDW0sI/AAAAAAAAh0U/zn0D3W-aZg0/s1600/corner-flag-1.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Friendly fire.&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2Y2kBtsLzpw/VHU7heDW0sI/AAAAAAAAh0U/zn0D3W-aZg0/s1600/corner-flag-1.jpg&quot; title=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Tue 18th Nov 2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;World Champions &lt;b&gt;Germany &lt;/b&gt;slid and slipped in a Vigo monsoon to a &lt;b&gt;1-0 win over Spain&lt;/b&gt;.

A Wayne Rooney brace took him to third in the list of all-time England goalscorers, while Scotland lost their first in five. The world&#39;s oldest football international dates back to 1870.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fabio Capello, unpaid for five months, got some relief as &lt;b&gt;Russia &lt;/b&gt;enjoyed a first win in four, 2-1 against Hungary in Budapest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Greece &lt;/b&gt;followed up their embarrassing defeat to the Faroes by losing 2-0 at home to &lt;b&gt;Serbia&lt;/b&gt;, their fourth reverse in five.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Japan &lt;/b&gt;won their AFC derby against &lt;b&gt;Australia &lt;/b&gt;2-1 in Osaka. Yasuyuki Konno and Shinji Okazaki were on the mark for the Samurai Blue, while Tim Cahill netted a consolation for the Socceroos. In Teheran, &lt;b&gt;Iran &lt;/b&gt;beat &lt;b&gt;South Korea&lt;/b&gt; 1-0.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Poland &lt;/b&gt;drew 2-2 with &lt;b&gt;Switzerland &lt;/b&gt;in Wroclaw, &lt;b&gt;Italy &lt;/b&gt;beat &lt;b&gt;Albania &lt;/b&gt;1-0 in Genoa and fast-improving&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;Romania &lt;/b&gt;beat Denmark 2-0 in Bucharest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Late kick-offs:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bolivia v Venezuela, Chile v Uruguay, Peru v Paraguay, Panama v Canada, Nicaragua v El Salvador&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;-&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/soccerphile/columnists/sean-oconor.html&quot;&gt;Sean O&#39;Conor&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; Soccerphile&lt;/i&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/feeds/2129295450495011977/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7424337262078805962&amp;postID=2129295450495011977' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/2129295450495011977'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/2129295450495011977'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/11/friendly-fire.html' title='Friendly fire'/><author><name>Sean O&#39;Conor</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='33' height='20' src='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_alcLfIha2wA/SfGD9nB7_6I/AAAAAAAAA9w/hefDCUsPw00/S220/puma.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2Y2kBtsLzpw/VHU7heDW0sI/AAAAAAAAh0U/zn0D3W-aZg0/s72-c/corner-flag-1.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7424337262078805962.post-4870134257608762754</id><published>2014-11-15T03:41:00.001Z</published><updated>2014-11-26T03:21:17.137Z</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Colombia"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Craven Cottage"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Fulham"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="international friendlies"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="James Rodriguez"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Jose Pekerman"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Jurgen Klinsmann"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Sean O&#39;Conor"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="USA"/><title type='text'>Colombian gold melts the solid States</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1kW5LUukNJw/VHPvXLpl6pI/AAAAAAAAhyk/XB28a0DXB0Q/s1600/balls.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Colombian gold melts the solid States.&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1kW5LUukNJw/VHPvXLpl6pI/AAAAAAAAhyk/XB28a0DXB0Q/s1600/balls.jpg&quot; title=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;International Friendly, London&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;USA 1:2 COLOMBIA&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;Meaningless&#39; friendlies are supposed to be on borrowed time. The national associations are getting fed up of endless spats with big clubs who don&#39;t want their precious stars coming back injured from international duty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But any skeptics of these games&#39; value should have been at Craven Cottage tonight where &lt;b&gt;Colombia and the USA &lt;/b&gt;went at it all guns blazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sell-out crowd who turned up on the back of both nations&#39; impressive World Cup showings got their value for money after a fiery friendly by the Thames.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both teams picked up where their World Cups in Brazil had ended - the USA still stout, well-marshalled and trying to win via counter-attacks and set pieces against superior opponents, and Colombia fearlessly positive with an attacking and energetic game-plan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The crowd made the occasion memorable. Despite US Soccer hosting a &#39;home&#39; game, London&#39;s oft-forgotten Colombian community had turned out en masse: Cumbia drums, straw hats and flags aplenty, children decked out in national colours and plenty of beautiful women. This was a national carnival run riot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Colombia pulled back &lt;b&gt;Jozy Altidore&lt;/b&gt;&#39;s early penalty for the US with strikes from &lt;b&gt;Carlos Bacca&lt;/b&gt; and Teofilo Gutierrez, their fans celebrated as wildly as anything Fulham had seen before. And whenever &lt;b&gt;James Rodriguez&lt;/b&gt;, skippering the side, merely touched the ball, the decibel level shot up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2-1 to Colombia was a fair result given their dominance of the 90 minutes, but once again Jurgen Klinsmann showed his US eleven are no pushovers and can startle the great, in this case the team who are third in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/home/fifa-rankings&quot;&gt;FIFA World Rankings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Americans kept their shape and solidity and in Brazil 2014 stars Kyle Beckerman, John Brooks and Jermaine Jones, have a new spine to build around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The US also had attacking elements which could trouble Colombia, albeit in isolation. And they certainly had their chances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Altidore, still forgotten about by Sunderland, maintained his double life as a first-choice international striker, worrying Colombia&#39;s modest centre-back pairing of Pedro Franco and Jeison Murillo with his prize-fighter&#39;s physique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the right flank, DeAndre Yedlin&#39;s fast feet reminded Tottenham fans what they can look forward to when he makes the move from Seattle in 2015.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A quicksilver dash by Yedlin late in the game almost yielded a goal but Pablo Armero&#39;s last gasp lunge saved the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Debutant US striker Rubio Rubin, all of 18 years old, was a revelation, slotting effortlessly into the starting lineup and providing Altidore with a talented foil in attack. On his knees in prayer before the kick-off, the Utrecht forward might have had divine assistance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the magic deserted him just after half time when he guided a header from Alejandro Bedoya&#39;s delightful cross achingly just wide of the Colombian net.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Hawaiian Bobby Wood, old by Rubin&#39;s standards at 22, was another useful young marksman who equally spurned a chance, toe-poking a shot at Colombian goalie Camilo Vargas at the end of a lovely move forged by US substitutes DaMarcus Beasley and Lee Nguyen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rodriguez had it tough, surrounded by American jerseys every time he loitered in his favourite spot, in the centre, twenty yards from the opposition goal. His goalscoring threat remained limited to set pieces until on the hour mark he was instrumental in Colombia&#39;s equaliser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combining with Bacca on the edge of the box, the Real Madrid man slotted his return pass expertly between US defenders for the Sevilla striker to bypass Brad Guzan and fire home from an acute angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bacca found himself sidelined in Brazil but started tonight ahead of Jackson Martinez and Adrian Ramos, and made a virtuoso audition for being Colombia&#39;s main striker in the absence of Falcao, who was watching from the stands, wrapped up warm and nursing a calf injury.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He almost found the target in the first half, swerving a shot inches wide of the post after twenty minutes and finding the woodwork on the half hour mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colombia&#39;s winner came three minutes from time when Gutierrez met a cross from substitute Edwin Cardona and flicked his header past the diving Guzan. It was as much as they deserved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Juan Cuadrado, once again, was their real ace in the pack. The Fiorentina winger was the most lively of Jose Pekerman&#39;s soldiers from the start, beat players with effortless abandon and almost scored himself late on when he forced Guzan into a diving stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colombia have quickly come from nowhere, no World Cup qualification since 1998 to be precise, to being one of the most feared teams in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their insistence on playing on the front foot, often involving five men streaking upfield in attack, has rightly made them popular in world football, as have their joyful dancing celebrations, which they performed en cue in London this evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being ranked just behind World Cup finalists Germany and Argentina is some reward for Brazil kicking them out at the quarter-final stage in the summer, with unpunished rotation fouling on James.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maintaining that momentum into the 2016 Copa America and the 2018 World Cup with elevated expectations is now the challenge for their gentlemanly coach Jose Pekerman. On tonight&#39;s evidence, their World Cup fever is still high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The US, ranked 23rd by comparison, can console themselves with another steady performance with more promising youngsters making the step up to the national team. Klinsmann, who is also the technical director of US Soccer, is witnessing his masterplan of uniting the myriad branches of the American game beginning to bear fruit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Tuesday he takes his side to Dublin for a friendly with Eire, while Colombia visit the beautiful city of Ljubljana to take on Slovenia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike European teams who qualify for the European Championships, teams in North and South America qualify automatically for their regional tournaments, which makes games like tonight&#39;s so vital for gaining experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colombia and the United States at least, kept the friendly fires burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;GOALS&lt;/b&gt;: Altidore (USA) 1:0 10&#39;, Bacca (COL) 1:1 60&#39;, Gutierrez (COL) 1:2 87&#39;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;USA:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Four years later they won silver, losing 1:0 to Czechoslovakia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1964 and 1972 they won bronze, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P65hjJFUmqE&quot;&gt;defeating hosts West Germany 3:2&lt;/a&gt; along the way in front of 80,000 in Munich, presaging an even greater scalp of their other half at the World Cup two years later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike their Olympic team, which did not fully separate from the West until the late 1960s, East Germany fielded a separate national side from 1952 but never quite matched the same heights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RuTcbLvrFBg/VGKfjaIGmCI/AAAAAAAADrk/Z_MCfBBbFnM/s1600/ddr.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;East German national team&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;192&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RuTcbLvrFBg/VGKfjaIGmCI/AAAAAAAADrk/Z_MCfBBbFnM/s320/ddr.jpg&quot; title=&quot;DDR team&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jurgen Sparwasser&lt;/b&gt;&#39;s winning goal against West Germany in Hamburg in 1974 is remembered as their finest hour and they left their only finals appearance with credit, having also beaten Australia 2:0 and drawn 1:1 with Chile, topping Group A above their embarrassed hosts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the second round their luck run out however and they were eliminated, losing 1:0 to Brazil, 2:0 to the Netherlands and drawing 1:1 with Argentina.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sparwasser&#39;s lone goal at the finals needless to say turned him into a national hero, but he later defected to the West, a year before the Berlin Wall came down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6H3R8K1jQt8/VGKodOsDnxI/AAAAAAAADsQ/Gh1AAbGYQHE/s1600/jsjs.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6H3R8K1jQt8/VGKodOsDnxI/AAAAAAAADsQ/Gh1AAbGYQHE/s200/jsjs.jpg&quot; width=&quot;172&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The aptly named &lt;b&gt;Joachim Streich&lt;/b&gt; netted twice at the finals, and he went on to become his country&#39;s all-time scorer and most capped player, with an impressive 55 goals in 102 games.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Streich was equally prolific at club level, bagging 229 goals in 378 outings for Hansa Rostock and Magdeburg between 1969 and 1985.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At club level, Stasi favourite &lt;b&gt;Dynamo Berlin &lt;/b&gt;(now Berliner FC Dynamo) won the most domestic titles (10) but never got further than the last eight of the UEFA Champions Cup, losing to Nottingham Forest in 1980 and Roma in 1984.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wismut Karl Marx Stadt (now Erzebirge Aue) reached the same stage in 1959, losing to Young Boys of Berne, while Carl Zeiss Jena and Lokomotive Leipzig went one further in the Cup Winners Cup, both reaching, but losing the final.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jena dumped Roma, Valencia, Newport and Benfica out&amp;nbsp;in the 1981 European Cup Winners Cup,&amp;nbsp;before losing the final 2:1 to Dinamo Tblisi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leipzig, whom Tottenham had beaten in the 1974 semi-final, lost 1:0 in 1987&#39;s final to an Ajax side featuring Arnold Muhren, Frank Rijkaard and a young Dennis Bergkamp. Marco Van Basten scored the winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;FC&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;Magdeburg &lt;/b&gt;remain the only East German club to win a trophy in Europe, having beaten&amp;nbsp;Milan 2:0 in the 1974 Cup Winners Cup final.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the wall finally fell in 1989, the German Olympic programme saw an immediate boost in its performances. Franz Beckenbauer said that with the addition of East Germany, the&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Mannschaft&lt;/i&gt;, already world champions, would then be on top for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The German national team,&amp;nbsp;united for the first time at&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;Euro &#39;92&lt;/b&gt;, added three East German internationals, Thomas Doll, Matthias Sammer and Andreas Thom, to their squad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-R6f5XjuS4JQ/VGKim4WWgGI/AAAAAAAADr8/PGQsjHF-OpQ/s1600/ms.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-R6f5XjuS4JQ/VGKim4WWgGI/AAAAAAAADr8/PGQsjHF-OpQ/s200/ms.jpg&quot; width=&quot;134&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Doll was a tricky left-winger who went on to play for Lazio and Sammer became one of the game&#39;s greatest sweepers, winning a host of prizes including the Bundesliga as a player and later as a coach, the Champions League, European Championship and the European Footballer of the Year Award in 1996.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Germany lost the Euro &#39;92 final to Denmark, but went one stage further than their semi-final exit at Euro &#39;88. West Germany had won the World Cup in 1990, but the united Germany exited in the quarter-finals at USA &#39;94. Two years later they won Euro &#39;96 with one player from the former East, Sammer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others who swapped their blue shirts for white ones were Ulf Kirsten, Olaf Marschall, Heiko Scholz, Dirk Schuster and Dariusz Wosz. Uwe Rösler, who became a cult hero at Manchester City, played five times for East Germany.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/soccerphile/players/michael-ballack.html&quot;&gt;Michael Ballack&lt;/a&gt; is the most notable of later&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;German internationals&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;who grew up in the communist East&amp;nbsp;but there was also Robert Huth, Carsten Jancker, Jens Jeremies, Bernd Schneider and poor Robert Enke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-oywlPGYqeQg/VGK6JeHc7HI/AAAAAAAADsg/05B7pKNMVBo/s1600/tk.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Toni Kroos&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-oywlPGYqeQg/VGK6JeHc7HI/AAAAAAAADsg/05B7pKNMVBo/s200/tk.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Toni Kroos&quot; width=&quot;128&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Seven of Germany&#39;s 2002 squad were &#39;Ossi&#39; in origin, but that number trickled down to one in 2014 -&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;Toni Kroos&lt;/b&gt;, who was less than a year old when the wall came down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it is still possible for a player born behind the Iron Curtain to play for Germany, the prospects for further East German-born players making it to the Mannschaft look slim and Kroos could well be the last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;East German clubs and their youth systems have less funding than their western counterparts and none of the current 18 teams in the Bundesliga hail from the former DDR Oberliga first division.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Union Berlin, RB Leipzig and Erzgebirge Aue are the best-placed Eastern German clubs today, yet all ply their trade in the German second flight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below them in the third tier (Bundesliga 3), we find former DDR clubs Dynamo Dresden, Hansa Rostock, Energie Cottbus, Chemnitzer and Hallescher while Magdeburg, the only East German club to win a European trophy, are down in the fourth tier, the Regionalliga Nordost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;303&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/MRfOuOxt2Lg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;(c) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/soccerphile/columnists/sean-oconor.html&quot;&gt;Sean O&#39;Conor&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; Soccerphile&lt;/i&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/feeds/6301689842554471612/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7424337262078805962&amp;postID=6301689842554471612' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/6301689842554471612'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/6301689842554471612'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/11/when-ball-was-over-wall.html' title='When the ball was over the Wall'/><author><name>Sean O&#39;Conor</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='33' height='20' src='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_alcLfIha2wA/SfGD9nB7_6I/AAAAAAAAA9w/hefDCUsPw00/S220/puma.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7424337262078805962.post-5794224484530011139</id><published>2014-11-11T21:08:00.001Z</published><updated>2014-11-24T16:49:07.613Z</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="African Cup of Nations"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="David Moyes"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="FC Barcelona.

The new host was due to be announced at the finals draw, scheduled for the 26th of November, but Al-Jazeera TV has reported it will be revealed on Wednesday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only Algeria and Cape Verde have secured their qualification, with the remaining 14 teams decided on the 15th and 19th of this month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holders Nigeria are currently third in Group A, with their clash in Congo on the 15th key to making it through.

The most eye-catching UEFA Euro 2016 tie on Friday sees little &lt;b&gt;Gibraltar&lt;/b&gt;, who have shipped seventeen goals and scored none in their first three qualifiers, visiting world champions &lt;b&gt;Germany&lt;/b&gt; in Nuremberg.

The 21-year-old has fired in eight goals in 13 appearances for Albion this season and has now been rewarded with a spot in Roy Hodgson&#39;s latest squad. Hodgson has also included Manchester United midfielder Michael Carrick in his Three Lions side, despite leaving him out of the World Cup, while Arsenal&#39;s Theo Walcott also returns to international football following an injury. West Ham winger Stewart Downing gets his first call-up since May 2012 after an excellent start to the season with the Hammers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soccer  Pellegrini worried by City crisis &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini admits his players are suffering from a crisis of confidence after losing at home to CSKA Moscow in the Champions League. The Premier League champions are now 4/1 with bet365 to qualify for the last-16 of the competition after Seydou Doumbia’s brace secured the Russians the win at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://devonvisitor.blogspot.com/2012/05/etihad-stadium-sport-city-manchester.html&quot;&gt;Etihad Stadium&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday. City, who also had Yaya Toure and Fernandinho sent off, are now bottom of the group with two games left to play, and Pellegrini says he can’t understand why they are struggling in the Champions League. &quot;It&#39;s very difficult to understand why we played so badly,&quot; Pellegrini told Sky Sports. &quot;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s just this competition. I think in the last two weeks we are not playing bad, but we are not playing the way we normally do. &quot;It is a crisis of confidence and we must find out why by talking to the players every day.&quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/10/georges-premiership-predictions.html&quot;&gt;Last time&#39;s predictions&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/feeds/3197308885262254233/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7424337262078805962&amp;postID=3197308885262254233' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/3197308885262254233'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/3197308885262254233'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/11/georges-premiership-predictions.html' title='George&#39;s Premiership Predictions November 8 2014'/><author><name>Soccerphile</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='6' src='http://bp3.blogger.com/_USzog_GOzyA/R-enhnyI37I/AAAAAAAADcs/gy7OPVaMJSY/S220/japan-visitor-logo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7424337262078805962.post-6489080447596380527</id><published>2014-11-07T01:09:00.000Z</published><updated>2014-11-24T13:44:37.902Z</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="CHuck Blazer"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Emirates"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="FIFA 2022 Qatar"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="FIFA corruption"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Mohamed Bin Hammam"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Sean O&#39;Conor"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Sunil Gulati"/><title type='text'>Emirates fly from FIFA, FBI key to Blazer betrayal </title><content type='html'>&lt;b&gt;Emirates Airlines&lt;/b&gt; has withdrawn from sponsoring the World Cup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Dubai-based company was one of &lt;b&gt;FIFA&lt;/b&gt;&#39;s six &#39;Tier One&#39; major World Cup sponsors along with &lt;b&gt;Coca-Cola, Visa, Hyundai/Kia, Sony and Adidas&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-plKPqE-X52w/VFwT9XkTr-I/AAAAAAAADqI/5TxdhlYD6m4/s1600/em.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-plKPqE-X52w/VFwT9XkTr-I/AAAAAAAADqI/5TxdhlYD6m4/s1600/em.jpg&quot; height=&quot;167&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Their press release gave little away: &quot;This decision was made,&quot; it explained, &quot;following an evaluation of FIFA&#39;s contract proposal which did not meet Emirates&#39; expectations.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it would be a surprise if the volte-face was not down to the continuingly negative news surrounding FIFA&#39;s notorious double World Cup vote in 2010.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emirates not only had the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/home/world-cup-2022&quot;&gt;2022 tournament&lt;/a&gt; on their doorstep in Qatar but are already heavily involved in football, sponsoring many tournaments and high-profile teams including Real Madrid, Milan, Paris Saint-Germain and Arsenal, whose stadium is named after the airline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of the six big sponsors look good in the light of relentless corruption stories, but only &lt;b&gt;Sony &lt;/b&gt;has so far hinted at following Emirates&#39; lead. Second-tier sponsors BP and Budweiser have expressed worries about FIFA&#39;s soiled reputation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hitting football&#39;s governing body where it hurts, in the pocket, is perhaps the only hope of washing away the den of thieves who have run football for too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-35sKy_nAWwU/VFwYlgRydLI/AAAAAAAADqo/bc93hp-WiO4/s1600/balls.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-35sKy_nAWwU/VFwYlgRydLI/AAAAAAAADqo/bc93hp-WiO4/s1600/balls.jpg&quot; height=&quot;144&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Visa, Sony and &lt;b&gt;Adidas&lt;/b&gt;, whose relationship with FIFA is apparently umbilical since the founder&#39;s son Horst Dassler befriended FIFA boss Joao Havelange, expressed concern at the corruption allegations back in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet Qatar Airways and Samsung are rumoured to be willing to step in to form part of the magic circle of six if anyone else pulls out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emirates have gone from the top table, but with the World Cup still the planet&#39;s biggest draw, it is hard to see how the biggest global companies will refuse to claim their places at the feast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only this weekend, the &lt;b&gt;New York Daily News&lt;/b&gt; ran a story revealing that former Executive Committee stalwart &lt;b&gt;Chuck Blazer&lt;/b&gt; was used by the &lt;b&gt;FBI&lt;/b&gt; to spy on his colleagues until they hung him out to dry in 2013, when FIFA suspended him from all football-related activities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4uqFfzhIRaE/VFwTOeH5KrI/AAAAAAAADqA/5hKYDqaqZRU/s1600/NYDN.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4uqFfzhIRaE/VFwTOeH5KrI/AAAAAAAADqA/5hKYDqaqZRU/s1600/NYDN.jpg&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; width=&quot;161&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Blazer&#39;s champagne lifestyle and embezzlement of football funds had already been well documented, featuring Caribbean properties, a pad in Trump Tower and a $6 million flat for his cats, but the FBI link finally explains his shopping of his CONCACAF boss Jack Warner &amp;amp; FIFA Presidential candidate Mohamed Bin Hammam in 2011.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pair had tried to bribe the Caribbean Football Union with bags of cash to vote for Bin Hamman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The super-sized American&#39;s huge girth and even larger self-aggrandizement, as evinced by his &lt;a href=&quot;http://chuckblazer.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;pompous blog&lt;/a&gt;, could not have made his malfeasance more obvious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The New Yorker cruised around the Big Apple&#39;s top restaurants in a motor scooter while his vintage Mercedes was parked in Zurich for FIFA business.

Summer temperatures in the USA are not ideal either if played like in 1994 at times to suit European television audiences, although evening kick-offs are possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Australia would be the ideal choice as June-July is their rather mild winter, but if winter it must be, runners-up the US &amp;amp; Australia surely have a case in taking FIFA to court for breach of contract.

The world&#39;s most expensive footballer was an unused substitute in the 5-0 thrashing of Levante at Estadi Ciudad de Valencia in La Liga earlier this month. The 25-year-old also sat out the Champions League win against Liverpool at Anfield and the El Clasico victory against bitter rivals Barcelona on Saturday because of a hip injury. &quot;It&#39;s a lie that Bale couldn&#39;t play three consecutive matches,&quot; Ancelotti said ahead of Real Madrid&#39;s Copa del Rey clash with Cornella on Wednesday. &quot;He just has a small injury.&quot; The likes of summer signing James Rodriguez and Spain forward Isco have been the principal beneficiaries of Bale&#39;s absence but coach Ancelotti insisted the former Tottenham flyer still has a big future with the capital giants. &quot;It seems like many have forgotten that Gareth Bale scored in the Copa del Rey and UEFA Champions League finals [last season],&quot; he added. &quot;He is equally important as James Rodriguez and Isco.&quot; Real Madrid are currently priced 5/6 by bet365 in the La Liga outright betting and 10/3 to win this season&#39;s Champions League.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soccer - El Clasico now in the past for Enrique&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barcelona coach Luis Enrique has said he will have no problem motivating his players for Saturday&#39;s La Liga visit of Celta Vigo to Camp Nou. The Spanish leaders conceded and lost for the first time this season when suffering a 3-1 defeat to title rivals Real Madrid in the capital on Saturday in Enrique&#39;s first El Clasico since taking charge in the summer. Enrique said his players have already moved on from the setback and are determined to get back to winning ways against Eduardo Berizzo&#39;s men this weekend. &quot;It&#39;s never nice for a Barca fan to see their team lose but I am not especially upset about it. If anything, it&#39;s renewed our motivation,&quot; he told a media conference. &quot;At the end of the day, we are joint leaders after nine games and for me it&#39;s much more important to be top of the league than to have beaten Real Madrid.&quot; The 44-year-old also said he would have no issue losing again to Carlo Ancelotti&#39;s men and champions Atletico Madrid this season as long as Barca end up winning the title. &quot;I&#39;d happily settle for getting beaten at Camp Nou against Madrid, Atletico and anybody else as long as we end up winning the title.&quot; Barcelona are currently priced 1/8 by bet365 in the match betting and the draw is quoted 15/2. Celta Vigo are available to back in the 90 minutes market at 16/1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/10/georges-premiership-predictions-october.html&quot;&gt;Last time&#39;s predictions&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/feeds/6073133916179067221/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7424337262078805962&amp;postID=6073133916179067221' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/6073133916179067221'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/6073133916179067221'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/10/georges-premiership-predictions.html' title='George&#39;s Premiership Predictions November 1 2014'/><author><name>Soccerphile</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='6' src='http://bp3.blogger.com/_USzog_GOzyA/R-enhnyI37I/AAAAAAAADcs/gy7OPVaMJSY/S220/japan-visitor-logo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7424337262078805962.post-1267051742869409798</id><published>2014-10-28T23:30:00.000Z</published><updated>2014-11-24T13:45:21.684Z</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2014 World Cup"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2018 World Cup logo"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="FIFA"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Russia 2018"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Sean O&#39;Conor"/><title type='text'>2018 World Cup logo revealed</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CzDYrN6QWdc/VFAZrPUK8NI/AAAAAAAADpg/pCKRIvNuwv0/s1600/wc%2B2018.jpeg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CzDYrN6QWdc/VFAZrPUK8NI/AAAAAAAADpg/pCKRIvNuwv0/s1600/wc%2B2018.jpeg&quot; height=&quot;320&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;It was midnight in &lt;b&gt;Moscow &lt;/b&gt;as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/russia2018/organisation/media/newsid=2462679/index.html&quot;&gt;three Russian astronauts&lt;/a&gt; from the international space station revealed the emblem of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/home/world-cup-2018&quot;&gt;next World Cup finals&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The image was then projected onto the facade of the famous Bolshoi Ballet. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.es/search?q=world+cup+logos&amp;amp;oq=world+cup+logos&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.2862j0j4&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;es_sm=93&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&quot;&gt;World Cup logos&lt;/a&gt; go it is pretty inoffensive, if not rather conservative, as perhaps befitting of the Russian Republic, but it is undeniably elegant at the same time and given the litany of dodgy sporting emblems, we can hardly complain.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It appears a more elegant and refined version of Brazil&#39;s 2014 effort, although vaguely reminiscent of a deodorant in its rounded smoothness.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The shape is loosely the FIFA World Cup trophy once more and the red, gold and black are nods to the medieval tradition of Russian icon painting.

Empoli was the highest-placed Italian club with seven, the same as Arsenal.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ajax&lt;/b&gt;, outside the five big leagues but with a legendary youth system, have 15 own-grown players, but are topped by Argentina&#39;s River Plate, with 17.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;When it comes to importing &lt;b&gt;players from overseas&lt;/b&gt;, the Premier League came top in 2013-&#39;14 with a percentage almost twice as big as France&#39;s.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Premier League &amp;nbsp; 63%&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Serie A &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 55%&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Bundesliga &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 41%&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;La Liga &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 39%&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Ligue 1 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 32%&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the overall picture, at least in England and Italy, is of clubs buying in more and more talent despite spending a fortune on youth systems to avoid the huge costs that entails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The situation is really quite curious. For ambitious young players trying to make it at Europe&#39;s biggest clubs, the best chance of success paradoxically seems to be to get transferred to another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;- &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/soccerphile/columnists/sean-oconor.html&quot;&gt;Sean O&#39;Conor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/feeds/266554811910151572/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7424337262078805962&amp;postID=266554811910151572' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/266554811910151572'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/266554811910151572'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/10/buy-first-develop-players-later.html' title='Buy first, develop players later'/><author><name>Sean O&#39;Conor</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='33' height='20' src='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_alcLfIha2wA/SfGD9nB7_6I/AAAAAAAAA9w/hefDCUsPw00/S220/puma.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7424337262078805962.post-3811644222685829064</id><published>2014-10-27T10:02:00.000Z</published><updated>2014-10-28T00:21:27.835Z</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2010 FIFA World Cup"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Bafana bafana"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="crime in South Africa"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Orlando Pirates"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Sean O&#39;Conor"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Senzo Meyiwa"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="South Africa"/><title type='text'>South Africa captain dies </title><content type='html'>&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1Yk3piriO6s/VE4WtxIlHTI/AAAAAAAADpQ/XiNqsUXjJrk/s1600/sw.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1Yk3piriO6s/VE4WtxIlHTI/AAAAAAAADpQ/XiNqsUXjJrk/s1600/sw.jpg&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; width=&quot;193&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18.9871444702148px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;South Africa&lt;/b&gt; &amp;amp; Orlando Pirates captain &lt;b&gt;Senzo Meyiwa&lt;/b&gt; has been killed in an armed burglary.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18.9871444702148px;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18.9871444702148px;&quot;&gt;At 8pm yesterday two men entered the house he was visiting in Vosloorus and following an altercation over a mobile phone, Meyiwa was shot and pronounced dead on arrival at hospital in Johannesburg.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18.9871444702148px;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18.9871444702148px;&quot;&gt;Meyiwa led a complex private life and at the time of his death was visiting th&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18.9871444702148px;&quot;&gt;e house of actress/singer Kelly Khumalo, with whom he had fathered a child.

It is so often assumed that the title will go to one or other of the giants that these games are seen as deciders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Atletico Madrid won last season&#39;s championship, Sevilla are a point ahead of Real and Valencia and Atletico are only a point behind in the table but these salient facts have almost been forgotten in the hype approaching tonight&#39;s game at the Bernabeu.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With revenues comfortably outstripping their rivals, the twice-yearly extravaganza that is Real v Barça goes on, the two enterprises cherry-pick the brightest stars each summer for their particular galaxies, and press coverage of this&amp;nbsp;clásico descends into another duel between famous individuals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So once again it is Lionel Messi v Cristiano Ronaldo, the two finest footballers in the world. Then there is the sub-plot of Neymar, Andres Iniesta and the much-anticipated debut of Luis Suarez for the Blaugrana versus Karim Benzema, James Rodriguez and Gareth Bale for Real, although the Welsh wonder will miss out through injury.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tCKZwWiVvXk/VHU8I2IaCPI/AAAAAAAAh0c/MA4o56ncIoI/s1600/modric-2.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Clásico in Spain, Suarez bites back.&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tCKZwWiVvXk/VHU8I2IaCPI/AAAAAAAAh0c/MA4o56ncIoI/s1600/modric-2.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Modric.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The loss of Bale and the sale of Angel di Maria to Manchester United leaves Real without much pace to support Ronaldo, but arriving on the back of a 3-0 humbling of Liverpool at Anfield while Barça maintained their stuttering Champions League form, the home side should have the edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suarez&#39;s return to competitive football after his flesh-eating fiasco in the World Cup could be the stuff of legend if the Uruguayan runs riot on an unprepared Real defence. Alternatively he may struggle for match sharpness in his first real run-out since June.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The former Liverpool man is set to start on the bench for Barça and come on as an impact sub, as is Real&#39;s Chicharito, who could just as well steal the headlines with a game-winning cameo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the outcome of today&#39;s clash is most likely to be decided by the relative brilliance of Messi or Ronaldo again, unsung heroes like attacker Pedro, or midfield anchor Sergio Busquets could hold the key for Barça. On the other side, the much-improved Benzema and Isco could be decisive for Real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &#39;return-leg&#39; of this annual jamboree is on the 22nd of March 2015 at the Camp Nou.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;Probable teams&lt;/u&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Real Madrid &lt;/b&gt;(4-4-2) - &lt;i&gt;Casillas, Carvajal, Marcelo, Pepe, Ramos, Modric, Kroos, Rodriguez, Isco, Benzema, Ronaldo&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Barcelona &lt;/b&gt;(4-3-3) - &lt;i&gt;Bravo, Alves, Alba, Mathieu, Pique, Iniesta, Busquets, Xavi, Neymar, Messi, Pedro&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;-Sean O&#39;Conor&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/feeds/2707815583164839604/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7424337262078805962&amp;postID=2707815583164839604' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/2707815583164839604'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/2707815583164839604'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/10/clasico-in-spain-suarez-bites-back.html' title='Clásico in Spain, Suarez bites back'/><author><name>Sean O&#39;Conor</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='33' height='20' src='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_alcLfIha2wA/SfGD9nB7_6I/AAAAAAAAA9w/hefDCUsPw00/S220/puma.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OsiOBG5KksA/VE4VfZqSC0I/AAAAAAAAg7U/WC5z9Kug0vk/s72-c/bernabeu-1.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7424337262078805962.post-8909571925504906627</id><published>2014-10-24T21:16:00.004+01:00</published><updated>2014-10-24T21:20:33.258+01:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="ECA"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="FIFA"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="FIFA 2022 Qatar"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Sean O&#39;Conor"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="winter World Cup"/><title type='text'>Europe&#39;s clubs back a Spring World Cup, but Blatter wants November</title><content type='html'>The tussle over when to host the &lt;b&gt;2022 World Cup&lt;/b&gt; rumbles on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Days after potential FIFA Presidential candidate Harold Mayne-Nicholls, the Chilean with the oh-so English name, proposed moving the tournament back a month to&lt;b&gt; May 2022&lt;/b&gt; and kicking off as late as 1am to temper the effects of the summer heat, Europe&#39;s clubs seem to be moving in that direction.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The &lt;b&gt;European Club Association&lt;/b&gt; which represents the continent&#39;s top clubs is set to back a switch to &lt;b&gt;April or May &lt;/b&gt;of 2022. Their initial preference for January and February now seems to have bitten the dust after the International Olympic Committee, which counts FIFA President &lt;b&gt;Sepp Blatter&lt;/b&gt; as a member, refused to contemplate moving the 2022 Winter Olympics to accommodate FIFA&#39;s cock-up.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Blatter has gone on record saying the winter is his ideal date, which would put him on a collision course with Europe the financial heart of football. &quot;We cannot play the World Cup in summer,&quot; he reiterated this week.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Yet the &lt;b&gt;Association of European Professional Leagues&lt;/b&gt; has also stated it is dead against any disruption to its winter schedules and reluctantly maintains that summer 2022 is the only option.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;European players&#39; unions, whose members made up around three-quarters of the footballers at the last World Cup, are yet to get involved in the dispute although former Australian custodian Mark Schwarzer said earlier this week about a summer tournament in Qatar, &quot;It&#39;s ridiculous to play at that time of year. I don&#39;t know why there is a debate.&quot; Their clubs might favour the minimum disruption to their businesses, but how many players will want to kick-off in an average of 35 Celsius, three degrees above FIFA&#39;s own threshold for extreme risk?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/--B3NX7Dt2Ck/VEq0efmNXRI/AAAAAAAADos/uB_W7qq0FlA/s1600/arupp.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/--B3NX7Dt2Ck/VEq0efmNXRI/AAAAAAAADos/uB_W7qq0FlA/s1600/arupp.jpg&quot; height=&quot;249&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Underlying the latest developments is a suspicion that the climate-cooling technology promised in 2010 may not materialise, as it has never been tested on a large-scale before.

Luis Enrique&#39;s Barcelona will make the hotly-anticipated trip to the Spanish capital having had an extra day&#39;s rest from Tuesday&#39;s 3-1 win against Ajax in the Champions League. Ronaldo and Camp Nou icon &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/soccerphile/players/lionel-messi.html&quot;&gt;Messi&lt;/a&gt; have long been pitted together as big rivals for the world&#39;s best-player tag, but the Portugal superstar says Saturday&#39;s showdown is not about individuals. The Catalan capital title-chasers have only dropped two points from their opening eight games in the top flight and have yet to concede a goal in Spain&#39;s La Liga. Ballon d&#39;Or winner Ronaldo says Los Blancos need to beat Barca to have any hope of usurping their rivals in the title race and is expecting a massive test. &quot;It will be a difficult match because Barcelona are playing well,&quot; he told the official club website. &quot;I&#39;m not going to play against Messi, I&#39;m going to play against Barcelona. They are a great team. Real Madrid and Barcelona are playing each other.&quot; Real Madrid are currently priced 11/8 by bet365 in the match betting and the draw is quoted 13/5. Barcelona are available to back in the 90 minutes market at 7/4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soccer - Rafael won&#39;t hide from Chelsea test&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rafael da Silva has said Manchester United should not fear the visit of leaders Chelsea on Sunday and demanded his team-mates make their own Premier League statement. The west London club have only dropped two points from their opening eight games - in a 1-1 draw against Manchester City - and have not lost in six previous meetings against the former champions. Young defender Rafael says Louis van Gaal&#39;s men are relishing the visit of Jose Mourinho&#39;s early-season pacesetters and said they can inflict a first defeat on the capital club. &quot;Everyone is beatable,&quot; he told the club&#39;s official website. &quot;We have to do our best, of course. They are playing well. &quot;We&#39;re playing at Old Trafford though and we&#39;ve been getting results there so they are definitely beatable.&quot; The 24-year-old is convinced Van Gaal&#39;s new signings are starting to have an impact at Old Trafford and feels victory against Chelsea could give the supporters a huge lift. He added: &quot;Football is about results and, when you don&#39;t play well and draw, like on Monday night [2-2 at West Brom], of course everyone will speak. But hopefully we can play well against Chelsea and, if we get the result, it would be very positive for us and the whole team.&quot; Manchester United are currently priced 9/5 by bet365 in the match betting and the draw is quoted 12/5. Chelsea are available to back at 7/5 in the 90 minutes market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/10/georges-premiership-predictions-18.html&quot;&gt;Last time&#39;s predictions&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/feeds/1344109350747154455/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7424337262078805962&amp;postID=1344109350747154455' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/1344109350747154455'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/1344109350747154455'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/10/georges-premiership-predictions-october.html' title='George&#39;s Premiership Predictions October 25 2014'/><author><name>Soccerphile</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='6' src='http://bp3.blogger.com/_USzog_GOzyA/R-enhnyI37I/AAAAAAAADcs/gy7OPVaMJSY/S220/japan-visitor-logo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7424337262078805962.post-775471174407650830</id><published>2014-10-23T13:37:00.000+01:00</published><updated>2014-10-27T09:52:21.348Z</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="England"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="England FIFA Ranking"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="FIFA"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Fifa World Rankings"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="scotland"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="USA"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="wales"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="world rankings"/><title type='text'>Fifa World Rankings October 2014</title><content type='html'>&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pYYDc0SabEw/UbByb2DLTDI/AAAAAAAAdn8/TonfgSojRhQ/s1600/fifa-rankings2.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;FIFA World Fifa Rankings&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pYYDc0SabEw/UbByb2DLTDI/AAAAAAAAdn8/TonfgSojRhQ/s200/fifa-rankings2.jpg&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; title=&quot;FIFA World Fifa Rankings&quot; width=&quot;177&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Fifa&#39;s World Rankings for October 2014 were published today at FIFA HQ in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/soccerphile/euro2008/city_guide/zurich.html&quot;&gt;Zurich&lt;/a&gt;, Switzerland.

The Clarets face West Ham United at Turf Moor this weekend before playing Everton on home soil on 26th October. Sean Dyche&#39;s side have drawn four of their first seven league matches of the season and are 4/11 with bet365 to be relegated. However, Burnley winger Kightly is optimistic that a victory is imminent, saying: &quot;We&#39;re disappointed not to have won a game but we&#39;ve got two home games after this international break and hopefully we can get a win. &quot;We just haven&#39;t had the rub of the green and we haven&#39;t got that win that we&#39;ve deserved. We know it will come.&quot; Burnley can be backed at 17/2 to beat the Hammers 1-0.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soccer - Beleaguered Redknapp wins Rio&#39;s backing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rio Ferdinand is convinced that Harry Redknapp is the right man to lead QPR away from the relegation zone this season. QPR are rooted to the foot of the Premier League table and face Liverpool on Sunday before playing Chelsea and Manchester City in the next month. Former Tottenham and West Ham United boss Redknapp has come under pressure following his side&#39;s poor start to the campaign and they are currently 8/15 with bet365 to be relegated this season and 20/1 to beat Liverpool 1-0 on Sunday. However, Ferdinand told the Evening Standard: &quot;We are not even in double figures for the amount of games played yet. To push the panic button now would be crazy in my eyes. Harry still comes across to me as a fighter and a man with a lot of fight left in him.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/10/georges-premiership-predictions-4.html&quot;&gt;Last time&#39;s predictions&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/feeds/5130267462757647026/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7424337262078805962&amp;postID=5130267462757647026' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/5130267462757647026'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/5130267462757647026'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/10/georges-premiership-predictions-18.html' title='George&#39;s Premiership Predictions 18 October 2014'/><author><name>Soccerphile</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='6' src='http://bp3.blogger.com/_USzog_GOzyA/R-enhnyI37I/AAAAAAAADcs/gy7OPVaMJSY/S220/japan-visitor-logo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7424337262078805962.post-2023413632514794778</id><published>2014-10-16T12:27:00.002+01:00</published><updated>2014-11-05T03:53:08.860Z</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="English Premier League"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Euro 2016"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="FC Barcelona.

Rather, English football has been exploiting the unique brand loyalty that is supporting a team ever since the Premier League turned &lt;i&gt;clubs &lt;/i&gt;into rapacious capitalists. A true club does not exploit its own members.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If demand is&amp;nbsp;rising&amp;nbsp;because England teams are now full of foreign stars, whose elephantine wages come from increased ticket costs rather than TV money, now that is another argument. But it is highly unlikely fans enjoy paying ever-larger sums for the product, to use that awful word, well aware that similar leagues or entertainment options come much cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The correlation between increasing attendance and rising ticket costs is not a simple economic equation of cold, hermetically-sealed logic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Football fans are more like devout churchgoers than pure brand-comparing customers whose choices come more from the head than the heart. It would be convenient if a cradle-to-grave, die-hard Arsenal follower could swap the Gunners tomorrow in favour of say, the more affordable Barnet F.C. up the road, but fandom does not work like that. That paradox allows irresponsible club owners to exploit supporters with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no reason why English football clubs could not sell more reasonably-priced tickets. When I was a teenager our clubs dominated Europe while charging prices kids could afford. They still &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/aug/13/bundesliga-premier-league-germany-ticket-prices&quot;&gt;charge sensibly&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;b&gt;Bundesliga &lt;/b&gt;after all and their league appears to be in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2794233/the-premier-league-looks-bundesliga-envy-bayern-munich-chairman-taunts-english-football.html&quot;&gt;pretty good health&lt;/a&gt;, with the highest attendances in the world to boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Szymanski retorts however that German tickets are too cheap and in some cases fuel a black market, as if no such touting exists in England. In other words, the market must rule, end of story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A new book on &lt;b&gt;Pep Guardiola at Bayern Munich&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;is released today, penned by Catalan journalist &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.totalbarca.com/2011/opinion-pieces/the-team-that-travels-together/#more-98663&quot;&gt;Marti Pernanau&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An aura surrounds the former Barça manager, for that golden team he forged in the &lt;i&gt;Cantera &lt;/i&gt;of the Camp Nou, and it no surprise to learn he was snowed in by job offers during his year-long self-imposed exile in New York City.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mFpMNYV4fWw/VD-ocZ8HlzI/AAAAAAAADoM/kRPp1KrQScw/s1600/bus32.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mFpMNYV4fWw/VD-ocZ8HlzI/AAAAAAAADoM/kRPp1KrQScw/s1600/bus32.jpg&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Alex Ferguson wined and dined him, Roman Abramovich courted him for Chelsea of course, but he agreed to coach Bayern from the 2013-&#39;14 season back in 2012. It&lt;br /&gt;seems the best fit for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elsewhere, Guardiola curiously lambasts &lt;b&gt;tiki-taka&lt;/b&gt; as a &quot;useless&quot; way of playing and calls Bayern&#39;s mauling by Real Madrid in last season&#39;s Champions League &quot;the biggest f*ck-up of my career.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extrapolating, he says that possession for possession&#39;s sake is pointless unless it leads to a goal and that Barcelona&#39;s pretty passing had a clear purpose in moving the majority of their team into the opponents&#39; final third.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once that has occurred, &quot;The secret is to overload one side of the pitch so that the opponent tilts his defence to cope,&quot;says Guardiola. &quot;And when we&#39;ve done all that, we attack and score from the other side.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus far, his reputation as a miracle worker remains intact and he remains the most sought-after manager in world soccer, but aged only 43, the Catalan still has a long way to go in coaching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having bagged two Champions Leagues, two Club World Cups, three Spanish league titles and two Spanish Cups by the age of 40, creating what some said was the greatest team of all time, has he already achieved too much, too soon?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stephen Keshi&lt;/b&gt; has been fired as Nigeria coach. &#39;Big Boss&#39; won the 2013 African Cup of Nations for Nigeria and became the first African coach to take a team to the knock-out s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Y2_tBsElDfE/VD-oJJyRR1I/AAAAAAAADoE/ukqLKfYLgms/s1600/Scotland%2Bv%2BNigeria%2B036.JPG&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Y2_tBsElDfE/VD-oJJyRR1I/AAAAAAAADoE/ukqLKfYLgms/s1600/Scotland%2Bv%2BNigeria%2B036.JPG&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;tages of the World Cup Finals this year, where the Super Eagles lost 2:0 to France.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One point from three games in qualifying for 2015&#39;s African Cup of Nations and an ongoing wage dispute with the federations led to the parting of ways.

Serbian defender Stefan Markovic grabbed the flag precipitating a brawl involving players and supporters. The two nations remain in dispute over Kosovo, a historically Serbian territory now populated by people of largely Albanian origin. Belgrade police arrested the brother of Albania&#39;s Prime Minister for allegedly organising the drone stunt. Georgia and Russia were previously banned from being drawn against each other while Armenia &amp;amp; Azerbaijan and Spain &amp;amp; Gibraltar are still kept apart by UEFA.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Neymar &lt;/b&gt;scored four as Brazil beat Japan 4-0. Dunga has a 100% record over four games since taking over from Felipe Scolari after the World Cup.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;World Cup Golden Boot winner &lt;b&gt;James Rodriguez &lt;/b&gt;scored the only goal as Colombia won 1-0 in Canada.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Argentina walloped Hong Kong 7-0 while 2022 World Cup hosts Qatar beat Australia 1-0. China beat Paraguay 1-0 but South Korea lost 3-1 at home to Costa Rica.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In their first game since &lt;b&gt;Landon Donovan retired&lt;/b&gt;, the USA drew 1-1 with Honduras in Boca Raton, Florida.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;World Champions &lt;b&gt;Germany &lt;/b&gt;slipped up again by conceding a last-gasp equalizer to Eire in their Euro 2014 qualifier in Gelsenkirchen. John O&#39;Shea levelled on the occasion of his 100th cap. The Mannschaft are equal third in Group D.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the same group, &lt;b&gt;Gibraltar &lt;/b&gt;got their best competitive result yet - a 3-0 loss at home to Georgia following two 7-0 defeats, while Poland and Scotland battled to a 2-2 draw in Warsaw.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In Group E, &lt;b&gt;Switzerland &lt;/b&gt;won their first points at the third attempt by winning 4-0 in San Marino.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Northern Ireland &lt;/b&gt;are the unlikely leaders of Group F after winning 2-0 in Greece.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cristiano Ronaldo&lt;/b&gt; got Portugal on the board in Group I with a last-minute winner against Denmark in Copenhagen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Italy, Sweden, Denmark, England, Portugal, Germany and Serbia booked their places in the &lt;b&gt;UEFA U21&lt;/b&gt; Championship in the Czech Republic next summer, but holders Spain, France and the Netherlands are among those who miss out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;English football continues to be &lt;b&gt;unaffordable &lt;/b&gt;according to a BBC study, with average ticket prices rising at double the rate of the cost of living since 2011.

Former Rangers shot-stopper McGregor faces a spell on the sidelines because of a shoulder injury that seems certain to force him to miss Scotland&#39;s Euro 2016 qualifiers against Georgia and Poland later this month. The 39-year-old former Newcastle United keeper Harper made 19 appearances for the Tigers in all competitions last season and featured in the Capital One Cup defeat to West Brom last month.

The 23-year-old has made 65 Premier League appearances for the Saints since moving to St Mary&#39;s from Crystal Palace in the summer of 2012 and has been in fine form so far this season. Hodgson said: &quot;He has impressed us for quite a while, even before the World Cup he was a name we were constantly considering. &quot;Now of course we have lost &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/soccerphile/premier-league/glen-johnson.html&quot;&gt;Glen Johnson&lt;/a&gt; and Kyle Walker and we were looking for another candidate for the right-back post and Nathaniel has been asked to come.&quot; Daniel Sturridge has not been selected for the qualifiers though as the Liverpool striker has a thigh injury. England are 14/1 with bet365 to win Euro 2016 outright and 2/9 to top Group E in qualifying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/09/georges-premiership-predictions-27.html&quot;&gt;Last time&#39;s predictions&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/feeds/3054200355722653702/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7424337262078805962&amp;postID=3054200355722653702' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/3054200355722653702'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/3054200355722653702'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/10/georges-premiership-predictions-4.html' title='George&#39;s Premiership Predictions 4 October 2014'/><author><name>Soccerphile</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='6' src='http://bp3.blogger.com/_USzog_GOzyA/R-enhnyI37I/AAAAAAAADcs/gy7OPVaMJSY/S220/japan-visitor-logo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7424337262078805962.post-3680450166108818171</id><published>2014-10-02T13:04:00.000+01:00</published><updated>2014-11-05T03:53:45.890Z</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="England"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Estonia"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Euro 2016"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Roy Hodgson"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="San Marino"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Sean O&#39;Conor"/><title type='text'>England squad announcement</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class=&quot;ng-scope&quot;

But lest we forget, &lt;i&gt;La Liga &lt;/i&gt;clubs made a clean sweep of UEFA trophies last season, as Real Madrid won the Champions League &amp;amp; Super Cup and Sevilla the Europa League.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;While the national team finally returned to winning ways with a 5-1 victory over Macedonia in their first Euro 2016 qualifier, the &lt;i&gt;Primera&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;has also resumed proceedings with the annual &lt;b&gt;Barça-Real &lt;/b&gt;ding-dong back into full swing.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Barcelona &lt;/b&gt;have resumed normal service, topping the Primera after six outings with five wins and a draw. &lt;b&gt;Real Madrid &lt;/b&gt;have started more slowly, surprisingly losing their opening two games of the season, away at Real Sociedad and at home to &lt;b&gt;Atletico Madrid&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Their city rivals are of course the reigning champions and Champions League runners-up, and it is very much to be hoped they can maintain that success to make the race for the Spanish title at least a little more interesting than a tussle between the usual two suspects.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Valencia &lt;/b&gt;is the most likely candidate to make it a four-horse race and the club coached by Portuguese Nuno Espirito Santo have made an encouraging start and find themselves second to Barça so far, just ahead of Atletico and Europa League winners&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;Sevilla&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The rest of the Spanish top flight once more looks depressingly weedy however, with the likes of Almeria, Eibar and Getafe unlikely to set many pulses racing.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Barça v Real may be an overblown, vulgar carnival at least twice a season, but the pulling power of the star-heavy lineups remains undeniable.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Their first clash, at the Bernabeu on the 25&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of October, has been on people&#39;s lips since the start of the campaign, particularly as it will feature the long-awaited debut of &lt;b&gt;Luis Suarez&lt;/b&gt; for the blaugrana.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;If the domestic league turns out to be as predictable as ever, then at least in &lt;b&gt;Europe &lt;/b&gt;the big two Spanish clubs face a battle.

The 27-year-old Frenchman is currently on loan at the Tigers from Newcastle United where he featured in 76 Premier League matches. Bruce has also signed the likes of Tom Ince, Michael Dawson, Abel Hernandez and Mohamed Diame since the end of last season, and Hull have made a solid start to the campaign, losing only one of their first five league matches. Ben Arfa said: &quot;It was the last five minutes of the transfer window when I arrived at Hull. The coach has built something interesting and I think we can expect to be in the top 10.&quot; Hull, 7/1 with bet365 to draw 1-1 against Manchester City on Saturday, can be backed at 4/1 to clinch a top-half finish this season. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2014 Ryder Cup - Punters Yet To Come For Passionate Poulter&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ian Poulter, the man who kick-started the &#39;Miracle of Medinah&#39; back in 2012 remains 8/1 and, so far, relatively unbacked with bet365 to be the top European at the 2014 Ryder Cup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bet365&#39;s Steve Freeth &quot;The 2012 Ryder Cup should hold happy memories for every European supporter, but it was the complete opposite for our golf In-Play traders who still carry the scars after taking a pounding at the hands of punters on that late September weekend. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Two years on, that double figure price comeback remains one of our worst ever golf results, but the man earmarked by the United States, Ian Poulter, is yet to be supported to continue his impressive record.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poulter is 13/8, behind 11/8 favourite Justin Rose, to be top Englishman at Gleneagles and 16/1 to hole the winning putt, whilst Europe are 8/13 favourites to win outright with USA at 7/4 and the tie at 10/1. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2014 Ryder Cup&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To Win Outright&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Europe 8/13 Tie 10/1 USA 7/4&lt;br /&gt;Top European E/W ¼ 1,2,3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rory McIlroy 4/1 Sergio Garcia 5/1&lt;br /&gt;Justin Rose 6/1 Henrik Stenson 8/1&lt;br /&gt;Ian Poulter 8/1 Martin Kaymer 9/1&lt;br /&gt;Graeme McDowell 10/1 Lee Westwood 12/1&lt;br /&gt;Jamie Donaldosn 18/1 Victor Dubuisson 20/1&lt;br /&gt;Stephen Gallacher 25/1 Thomas Bjorn 28/1&lt;br /&gt;Top Englishman&lt;br /&gt;Rose 11/8 Poulter 13/8 Westwood 5/2&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/09/georges-premiership-predictions-20.html&quot;&gt;Last time&#39;s predictions&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/feeds/4230217200776090782/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7424337262078805962&amp;postID=4230217200776090782' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/4230217200776090782'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/4230217200776090782'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/09/georges-premiership-predictions-27.html' title='George&#39;s Premiership Predictions 27 September 2014'/><author><name>Soccerphile</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='6' src='http://bp3.blogger.com/_USzog_GOzyA/R-enhnyI37I/AAAAAAAADcs/gy7OPVaMJSY/S220/japan-visitor-logo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7424337262078805962.post-50621468687305301</id><published>2014-09-19T12:36:00.001+01:00</published><updated>2014-11-05T03:55:13.753Z</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Betting"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Champions League"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="English Premier League"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="football betting"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Predictions"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Premiership"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Sports Betting"/><title type='text'>George&#39;s Premiership Predictions 20 September 2014</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href=&quot;http://imstore.bet365affiliates.com/Tracker.aspx?AffiliateId=3771&amp;amp;AffiliateCode=365_027632&amp;amp;CID=358&amp;amp;PID=149&amp;amp;TID=3&amp;amp;LNG=1&amp;amp;DID=27&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;bet365&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://imstore.bet365affiliates.com/?AffiliateCode=365_027632&amp;amp;CID=358&amp;amp;PID=149&amp;amp;LNG=1&amp;amp;TID=3&amp;amp;DID=27&quot; title=&quot;bet365&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;George had five correct Premier League predictions last week but no perfect scores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This weekend&#39;s standout tie is Manchester City, last year&#39;s Premier League champions against this year&#39;s current leaders with a 100% record.

The £16million striker, signed from Manchester United, marked his Gunners debut by hitting the woodwork against Manchester City, before spurning several opportunities in the 2-0 Champions League loss at Borussia Dortmund. However, Wenger is certain that England international Welbeck, who is 33/1 with bet365 to be top goalscorer in the Premier League this season, will come good in the very near future. He commented: &quot;Danny will improve, I don&#39;t think we have to make a problem of that. &quot;He had a very lively first half. He had two or three good chances but couldn&#39;t finish them. There was one obvious one. We have to be patient with him.&quot; The next challenge for Arsenal and Welbeck is a visit to Aston Villa on Saturday, with the hosts having taken ten points from a possible 12 from their opening four league games of the campaign. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soccer - Rodgers: Reds still adapting &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manager Brendan Rodgers believes that victories are key to allow his Liverpool side to move from being a work in progress to becoming the finished article. Rodgers was speaking after seeing his side edge a 2-1 victory at home to Ludogorets Razgrad in their opening Champions League Group B fixture, with the Reds needing a last-gasp Steven Gerrard penalty to take the spoils. And, with his side 7/2 with bet365 to top Group B, Rodgers said: &quot;There is a lot of adaptation going on as we have a lot of players who have come in and are still adapting. We are a work in progress and while we do that it is important we win games. &quot;It was very important to get back in the competition, but it was always going to be a tricky tie for us because they are the champions of their country and there are not too many bad teams in the competition. &quot;Maybe in the first six months we would have drawn and maybe even lost it, but we showed the resilience and character in the group.&quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/09/georges-premiership-predictions-13.html&quot;&gt;Last time&#39;s predictions&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/feeds/50621468687305301/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7424337262078805962&amp;postID=50621468687305301' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/50621468687305301'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/50621468687305301'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/09/georges-premiership-predictions-20.html' title='George&#39;s Premiership Predictions 20 September 2014'/><author><name>Soccerphile</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='6' src='http://bp3.blogger.com/_USzog_GOzyA/R-enhnyI37I/AAAAAAAADcs/gy7OPVaMJSY/S220/japan-visitor-logo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7424337262078805962.post-4654851052475480158</id><published>2014-09-18T12:49:00.001+01:00</published><updated>2014-10-23T13:31:57.490+01:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="England"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="England FIFA Ranking"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Euro 2016"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="FIFA"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Fifa World Rankings"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Germany"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="World Cup"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="world rankings"/><title type='text'>Fifa World Rankings September 2014</title><content type='html'>&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pYYDc0SabEw/UbByb2DLTDI/AAAAAAAAdn8/TonfgSojRhQ/s1600/fifa-rankings2.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;FIFA World Fifa Rankings&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pYYDc0SabEw/UbByb2DLTDI/AAAAAAAAdn8/TonfgSojRhQ/s200/fifa-rankings2.jpg&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; title=&quot;FIFA World Fifa Rankings&quot; width=&quot;177&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Fifa&#39;s World Rankings for September 2014 were published today at FIFA HQ in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/soccerphile/euro2008/city_guide/zurich.html&quot;&gt;Zurich&lt;/a&gt;, Switzerland.

He told reporters: &quot;It is well known I prefer to play through the middle, so when I get my opportunity I just want to show what I can do. &quot;Once I get into the box and get the opportunities I have got faith in my ability. &quot;Before I wasn&#39;t getting into the box because I wasn&#39;t playing too much as a striker and I had to worry about my defensive work.&quot; Welbeck is poised to make his debut for the Gunners on Saturday when they host the reigning Premier League champions, Manchester City.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soccer - Fabianski dreams of top four&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Swansea City goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski has called on his side to continue their good start to the new season, with a top-four finish in the Premier League a possibility. Fabianski and the Swans have won all three of their league games to date and head to Chelsea on Saturday to take on the only other side to have taken nine points out of nine. Poland international Fabianski sees no reason why City should not aim as high as possible, with the Welsh outfit 66/1 with bet365 to secure a top-four spot. Former Arsenal keeper Fabianski said: &quot;Obviously it is early in the season and it is too early for things like that (talk of a top-four finish), but if we keep going as we are game by game, you never know in football. &quot;Hopefully we could do it, why not? We don&#39;t have to be afraid of anything. &quot;It&#39;s a shame the international break came when it did because we made a great start to the season with three wins from three.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/05/georges-premiership-predictions-may-11.html&quot;&gt;Last time&#39;s predictions&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/feeds/3049143004938972370/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7424337262078805962&amp;postID=3049143004938972370' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/3049143004938972370'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/3049143004938972370'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/09/georges-premiership-predictions-13.html' title='George&#39;s Premiership Predictions 13 September 2014'/><author><name>Soccerphile</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='6' src='http://bp3.blogger.com/_USzog_GOzyA/R-enhnyI37I/AAAAAAAADcs/gy7OPVaMJSY/S220/japan-visitor-logo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7424337262078805962.post-4922049701246581659</id><published>2014-09-08T09:35:00.000+01:00</published><updated>2014-12-10T16:09:24.200Z</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Asian Champions League"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="FC Seoul"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Gyeongnam FC"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Hong Myong-bo"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Jeonbuk Motors"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Lee Dong-gook"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Pohang Steelers"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="South Korea"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Uli Stielike"/><title type='text'>Stielike, Seoul, Struggles - September in South Korea</title><content type='html'>This has been one crazy summer and most in Korean football are glad to see the back of it. The events of the World Cup are well-known. What comes next remains to be seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The search for Stielike&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;When the KFA reluctantly accepted the resignation of Hong Myung-bo in early July, they had no idea as to the identity of his replacement. Indeed, a number of senior figures in the organisation also resigned following the World Cup failure including vice-president &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/soccerphile/news/korean-soccer/huh-jung-moo.html&quot;&gt;Huh Jung-moo&lt;/a&gt;and chairman of the technical committee Hwangbo Kwan. His successor is Lee Yong-soo, who held the post back in 2002. Lee and the new committee wanted a European with World Cup experience, club experience and experience in developing young players as well as decent English skills. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bert Van Marwijk was the name on top of the list. Lee went to the Netherlands to talk to the man who led the Oranje to the final of the 2010 World Cup but the deal broke down mainly due to the Dutchman&#39;s desire to spend much of his time in Europe. The KFA wanted someone willing to get involved at all levels of the country&#39;s football scene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Former Juventus coach Ciro Ferrara was also high on the list but in the end, the successful candidate was something of a surprise. Uli Stielike was a fantastic midfielder for Real Madrid and West Germany in the seventies and eighties yet his coaching career is not quite as impressive. Unremarkable national team spells with Switzerland in the late eighties and the Ivory Coast in the previous decade are peppered by short-lived club terms, the most recent of which came in the volatile coaching region of West Asia. Years spent with German youth teams at the turn of the century appealed to the KFA and basically being German helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reaction was not especially positive or negative, though there is some relief that the post has been filled with the Asian Cup just four months away. Friendlies in October and November will give him a little time, though not much, to prepare for Australia. His bosses are looking longer-term but a bad start will, obviously, make it tough for a man whose record does not excite. Fans seem open-minded but there is not much credit in the bank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stumbles in the K-League&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pohang Steelers and Jeonbuk Motors have been here before and know well what it takes to win the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/home/k-league-k-league-classic&quot;&gt;K-League&lt;/a&gt; title. That doesn&#39;t mean they won&#39;t be frustrated at their recent slips in form. The only positive is that the two defeats in the last three that Jeonbuk have suffered and the dropping of eight points from the last four games from Pohang have not been capitalised on by rivals such as Suwon Bluewings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-M6bs50m_9Uc/VA10Yd9EoFI/AAAAAAAAgds/K6a70vcdpI0/s1600/lee-dong-gook.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Lee Dong-gook&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-M6bs50m_9Uc/VA10Yd9EoFI/AAAAAAAAgds/K6a70vcdpI0/s1600/lee-dong-gook.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Lee Dong-gook&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Jeonbuk are three points clear and the happier of the two, especially after their recent and clinical 2-0 win in Pohang, their bogey team in recent years. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/soccerphile/news/korean-soccer/lee-dong-gook.html&quot;&gt;Lee Dong-gook&lt;/a&gt; was on the scoresheet once again and remains on the top of the K-League goalscoring charts, not bad for a 35 year-old. Such form earned him a recall to the national team and the Lion King scored two fine goals in a very welcome 3-1 win over Venezuela on September 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the bottom, Gyeongnam FC are propping up the other 11 and despite not playing that badly of late have just not been getting the results that they have deserved. Two-time Asian champs and seven-time domestic winners Seongnam are starting to climb free of trouble, helped the return of legendary coach Kim Hak-beom. If he can perform anything like the same magic as the middle part of last decade, fans in the satellite city are in for a happier time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only team in excellent form are FC Seoul. The 2012 champions started the season so badly that their recent run is not going to end in a title challenge but it should at least ensure a top-half finish. Sixteen points from the last eighteen has taken some pressure off coach Choi Yong-soo though whether this season is regarded as a success will depend on what happens in a different theatre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Seoul of Asia?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is one of the slogans that can be seen around the big stadium in the capital city. Seoul reached the final of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/home/asian-football-confederation-asian-champions-league&quot;&gt;Asian Champions League&lt;/a&gt; in 2013, losing on away goals to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.beijing-visitor.com/china-travel-guides/guangzhou-guide&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Guangzhou&lt;/a&gt;Evergrande. The Koreans are now one game (if two legs) away from a repeat performance after seeing off Pohang in a turgid quarter-final that ended goalless after 210 minutes of football. The Steelers failed to score a single spot-kick and Choi Yong-soo&#39;s men sneaked through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Western Sydney Wanderers lie in wait in the semi-final and while it will be tough, an in-form Seoul, even one not as strong as the 2013 version, should be able to get through and then take on Al Ain or Al Hilal of Saudi Arabia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Seoul can collect a first continental title, then they will at least be able to end what has been a traumatic year for Korean football on a high.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/feeds/4922049701246581659/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7424337262078805962&amp;postID=4922049701246581659' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/4922049701246581659'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/4922049701246581659'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/09/stielike-seoul-struggles-september-in.html' title='Stielike, Seoul, Struggles - September in South Korea'/><author><name>John Duerden</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/18030826434552320752</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-M6bs50m_9Uc/VA10Yd9EoFI/AAAAAAAAgds/K6a70vcdpI0/s72-c/lee-dong-gook.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7424337262078805962.post-3962111322338909264</id><published>2014-08-14T11:34:00.001+01:00</published><updated>2014-11-05T03:55:48.777Z</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Euro 2016"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="FIFA"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Fifa World Rankings"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Germany"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="world rankings"/><title type='text'>Fifa World Rankings August 2014</title><content type='html'>&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pYYDc0SabEw/UbByb2DLTDI/AAAAAAAAdn8/TonfgSojRhQ/s1600/fifa-rankings2.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;FIFA World Fifa Rankings&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pYYDc0SabEw/UbByb2DLTDI/AAAAAAAAdn8/TonfgSojRhQ/s200/fifa-rankings2.jpg&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; title=&quot;FIFA World Fifa Rankings&quot; width=&quot;177&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Fifa&#39;s World Rankings for August 2014 were published today at FIFA HQ in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/soccerphile/euro2008/city_guide/zurich.html&quot;&gt;Zurich&lt;/a&gt;, Switzerland.

height=&quot;180&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Los Cafeteros have made the game beautiful again. They play to win and win attractively, dancing in joyous celebration and reminding the football world that a billion people are watching and want to be entertained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;God forbid we get another World Cup Final like 2010, when one team (the Netherlands) turned up looking to foul and kick their way to the trophy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colombia counter-attacking is about the best reason to get out of one&#39;s seat at Brazil 2014, and in the land of &lt;i&gt;o jogo bonito&lt;/i&gt;, they have out scored and out performed the home side, whom they face today in the quarter-final.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brazil v Colombia would have been a great final, but FIFA&#39;s misguided ranking system overloaded the first half of the draw and dumped four of the six South American teams in the same quarter of the second round.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Argentina have been spluttering along firing mostly blanks, leaving tonight&#39;s clash as the South American final of the World Cup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RAB-DPeqD2o/U7bGE5hAVbI/AAAAAAAADng/HFoAFTVDwXs/s1600/jp.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RAB-DPeqD2o/U7bGE5hAVbI/AAAAAAAADng/HFoAFTVDwXs/s1600/jp.jpg&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; width=&quot;149&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Colombia have been on a steady upwards curve since former Albiceleste boss &lt;b&gt;Jose Pekerman&lt;/b&gt; took over in 2012 and guided the coffee-makers to their first World Cup finals since 1998. Pekerman, who is distantly related to Hollywood legend Gregory Peck, carries himself with the same amount of dignity, refusing to get drawn into the narratives of journalists, whom he tends to shun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Serious and austere he may be, a striking contrast to the singing and dancing image of Colombia, but he lets his results do the talking and is a national hero in Colombia, albeit a most reticent one. When the Cafeteros have found the net, Pekerman&#39;s exterior has melted somewhat as he has briefly joined in with&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/colombia&quot;&gt;the hysteria&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Colombian nation has been allowed to smile again too. It suffered greatly from the narco-war of the 1990s, which spilled overt into its football, most notably with the collapse of the much-vaunted 1994 World Cup team and subsequent assassination of Andres Escobar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colombia is still a very economically divided nation with rampant corruption and paramilitary violence spilling over into people&#39;s lives too often. Football cannot solve these problems but can at least temporarily soothe them and give everyone&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FDecHa37Kk&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;a feeling of communal happiness&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact Colombia are a relative novelty at the finals created a lot of curiosity and the team have turned the global interest into admiration by winning every game with aplomb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-aAvHVtExeOs/U7bF0B_o63I/AAAAAAAADnY/zfdEJoBqIdA/s1600/jrod.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-aAvHVtExeOs/U7bF0B_o63I/AAAAAAAADnY/zfdEJoBqIdA/s1600/jrod.jpg&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;James Rodriguez&lt;/b&gt;, who also has an Argentine connection having spent two years with Banfield, is the unexpected top scorer at the World Cup so far, netting one more than the marketing men&#39;s favourites Neymar and Lionel Messi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unfortunate injury to &lt;b&gt;Falcao&lt;/b&gt;, who scored nine in qualifying, has let the 22 year-old Rodriguez take centre stage unexpectedly, and his exquisite goals, particularly the shimmy and deft chip against Japan and the exquisite chest to foot rocket against Uruguay, have made him the tournament&#39;s poster boy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are also the flying wingers Andres Cuadrado and Victor Ibarbo, whose high-speed raids have been thrilling, and goals from Jackson Martinez. Carlos Sanchez is a strong midfield enforcer and Mario Yepes at the age of 38 has been solid at the back. Bringing on 43 year old Faryd Mondragon was a lovely touch, and Colombia have won millions of fans for their joyful dance routines after scoring. Football is fun again and this team is impossible to dislike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that could end in tears tonight if as widely expected, the home team respond to their fans and the ghosts of 1950. Such is life in the knockout stages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having sailed through one of the weaker groups and demolished a demoralised Uruguay, Colombia face their first real test tonight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether Brazilian or Colombian coffee tastes the sweeter at the end, Colombia&#39;s return to the world stage has been a fantastic one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/72tm5Elv7Cc&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp_2plj-LqQ&quot;&gt;Learn the Colombian dance steps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(c) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/soccerphile/columnists/sean-oconor.html&quot;&gt;Sean O&#39;Conor&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; Soccerphile</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/feeds/7192221475431924686/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7424337262078805962&amp;postID=7192221475431924686' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/7192221475431924686'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/7192221475431924686'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/07/colombia-are-world-cup-winners-in-joy.html' title='Colombia are the World Cup winners, in joy at least'/><author><name>Sean O&#39;Conor</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='33' height='20' src='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_alcLfIha2wA/SfGD9nB7_6I/AAAAAAAAA9w/hefDCUsPw00/S220/puma.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-UBB9kJwPb_8/U7bCeFjokPI/AAAAAAAADnM/wVQSjojrUyE/s72-c/colombia-baile-celebracion-mundial.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7424337262078805962.post-1353744244927134863</id><published>2014-07-01T03:39:00.001+01:00</published><updated>2014-11-05T03:56:03.675Z</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Brazil"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="FIFA"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Ross Clegg"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="World Cup 2014"/><title type='text'>Reflection on two weeks in Brazil</title><content type='html'>A tale of nine cities.

Thinking about the revelations about companies outed In the UK, and the fact that the majority either made a donation or agreed to change the way they operate, why does FIFA not do the same. Are they a law unto themselves? Because they will say that they are investing money in football projects all over the world, which in encouraging people to be active and promotes healthier life styles?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brazil was under military rule only 25 years ago. This is a relatively short space of time in which it has been open to the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They need more openness to be able to change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What change was brought about by the creation of &lt;a href=&quot;http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/06/brasilia.html&quot;&gt;Brasilia&lt;/a&gt; in the 1960&#39;s, yes they created some wonderful science-fiction styled photo opportunities but what has that done for the people?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now FIFA have left their legacy with 12 magnificent stadiums, what will that do for the people?  What use will they get out of the stadiums in Manaus, Brasilia and Cuiaba where there is no major team in the cities to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some of the examples, I hinted at:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my bus on the way to Porto Alegre,  the driver was giving his health and safety talk when someone at the back put their hand up and said in English &quot;I can&#39;t understand&quot; (No, it wasn&#39;t me). The driver immediately said &quot;English, No.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He could have said &quot;Desculpe.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was on an escalator behind a local and I could sense he was confused. It reached the top, he got off and froze. With me behind him trying to get off, another Brazilian behind me saw what was happening, laughed and gave me a sympathetic look. The point is that he was confused as to where he wanted to go and in his panic simply froze, he didn&#39;t know what to do and didn&#39;t think about anyone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One time I went to collect my bus ticket, the person behind the counter struggled as the content of my email was in English. He told me he couldn&#39;t help for this sole reason. I had been watching him on his computer and saw that all he needed was my destination .... which was on the bit of paper in English where it said &lt;a href=&quot;http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/06/porto-alegre.html&quot;&gt;Porto Alegre&lt;/a&gt;. I told him Porto Alegre, he said OK. He was confused because he had been put into a situation he was not used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A number of times when buying food , I wouldn&#39;t know the name for something and so would use the trusty finger to point out what I would like, when they then bombarded me with a number of Portuguese questions and realised I didn&#39;t understand they gave up. They didn&#39;t want to serve me. Yet I was there with my money in their shop wanting to buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The point being that they are very uncomfortable with change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The people want government reform and they are the only ones that can make it happen. The people also have to change. The World Cup was a wonderful opportunity to start this process, but I fear time has been wasted, but I also hope lessons learnt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brzil is already a diverse country and one in which it is proud of the mixture of races present and the opportunity it gives to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Juliana told me about her studies where she achieved 600 marks and didn&#39;t qualify for the next year of her course, yet a friend who achieved 400 marks did - because she was black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is part of a government policy to acknowledge the debt owed due to enforced slavery. You can see both sides of the argument.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now in what is a multicultural country which wants to better itself why would you not encourage your best students.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The corruption hinted at in the 60&#39;s is still present today. Some have told me that this is the Brazilian way, that nobody gets anything for free that everyone wants their cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#39;t accept that this is a Brazilian problem. Greed is the problem and that is human nature and seen everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The person on the street is doing all they can to survive they are entitled to look for their cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But those in power need to be properly regulated, and accept this, they are already in a privileged position and should not be abusing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a lot of wealth in Brazil (remember the 2 year old on the remote control car- BH) but this wealth is in the hands of far too few people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One worry amongst some Brazilians is that they will win the World Cup, and if that happens the government will tell the people everything is fine we just had a wonderful party. As that is just what Brazilians do to forget their problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Italy v Costa Rica a Brazilian man approached an Italian and asked &quot;Why do you look so sad?&quot; She said &quot;We lost&quot;.

Except I am trying not to pop the blisters. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, Friday, there is no football, so once again it is like a holiday. I travelled overnight from &lt;a href=&quot;http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/06/curitiba.html&quot;&gt;Curitiba&lt;/a&gt; and arrived back in Belo Horizonte about 11a.m. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uAjQvEXB_cg/U6-7pSLMclI/AAAAAAAAgE8/iwazANp1TV4/s1600/bh4.JPG&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Modern Art Museum Belo Horizonte&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uAjQvEXB_cg/U6-7pSLMclI/AAAAAAAAgE8/iwazANp1TV4/s1600/bh4.JPG&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; title=&quot;Modern Art Museum Belo Horizonte&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decided to go up to the Lake at Pampulpa. Had a hobble round to the Art Museum (you&#39;ll have guessed, designed by Oscar) was going to see his church, but decided to save it for my next visit. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the evening Lou was singing so I went to see her, before returning to Espitinho Mangabeiras, where this all began.  On the Saturday, my final day, I was up early as I had received an email when I got in last night about 1am giving me an address to go to meet my wheelchair companion. Pampulpha is near the stadium and I was worried that they would shut the roads off. I didn&#39;t want to walk. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wLyQAX5xO3Y/U6-7ovTUldI/AAAAAAAAgEs/JgDT6NKlQ38/s1600/bh2.JPG&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Lou singing in BH, Brazil&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wLyQAX5xO3Y/U6-7ovTUldI/AAAAAAAAgEs/JgDT6NKlQ38/s1600/bh2.JPG&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; title=&quot;Lou singing in BH&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We met and my friend was pleased with my acting, with me like this we were confident we would get in, all that was missing was the wheelchair. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We went in as early as we could in case of any problems, but there were none. The wheelchair next to us didn&#39;t turn up so we had two excellent seats almost on the half way line. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, you now know that the match went to extra time and penalties. I knew that was going to happen when I booked my flight last year. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-V0m9sfygz6o/U6-7oskPMQI/AAAAAAAAgEw/gglctYAh9sQ/s1600/bh3.JPG&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Brazil v Chile, Belo Horizonte&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-V0m9sfygz6o/U6-7oskPMQI/AAAAAAAAgEw/gglctYAh9sQ/s1600/bh3.JPG&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; title=&quot;Brazil v Chile&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They changed the departure time a few times.

I have 45 minutes, to get back. Mmmmmm. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, today I will take it easy, found there is a free tourist bus that travels round the city so decided to use that. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First stop, The Eye. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XfCKHN-D9ts/U62FYyZtT-I/AAAAAAAAgEI/8WVjRfz0kpo/s1600/c-2.JPG&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;The Eye, Curitiba, Brazil&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XfCKHN-D9ts/U62FYyZtT-I/AAAAAAAAgEI/8WVjRfz0kpo/s1600/c-2.JPG&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; title=&quot;The Eye, Curitiba&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By now you may have grasped the concept the Brazilian cities I have visited are huge. Today in Curitiba, at the Oscar Niemeyer museum (where else!) The Eye there is a section on architecture and the development of Brazil. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the first half of the 20th century Brazil was inspired by Paris, however the desire for new plans lead to the cities looking more American (or to me Japanese) as the  cities extend for mile after mile, after mile. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-fv6kpfBPB6w/U62FYzZ-JeI/AAAAAAAAgD4/8XguWB0mUHE/s1600/c-3.JPG&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Oscar Niemeyer, Brazil&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-fv6kpfBPB6w/U62FYzZ-JeI/AAAAAAAAgD4/8XguWB0mUHE/s1600/c-3.JPG&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; title=&quot;Oscar Niemeyer&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two problems I can see - the Brazilian road system appears unlike anywhere else with a habit of having to drive in a loop to get going in the direction you want, and a vast amount of underpasses, making it very confusing to get around.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second - the lack of useful public transport. This is something that they were starting to address in the World Cup however the only new finished project I can recall is the metro in &lt;a href=&quot;http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/06/brasilia.html&quot;&gt;Brasilia&lt;/a&gt;. Elsewhere there is evidence of work starting....but none completed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the museum they acknowledge &quot;It will take a lot of innovation to intervene and overcome the problems of infrastructure, mobility, and public space of cities.&quot; They are not wrong. Monorail appears an appropriate solution, and there is evidence they are thinking about this.....but will they ever finish? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent the morning at the museum and rejoined the tourist bus on its 40km journey round the city. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disembarked in the city centre and walked (sort of) to the ground so that I knew the terrain after the game. Kick off 5p.m. Bus leaves 19.45. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were obvious signs that the builders had cut short their work on the stadium, as one annex was closed off. Elsewhere the signs had been nails on the ground at both Belo Horizonte and &lt;a href=&quot;http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/06/natal.html&quot;&gt;Natal&lt;/a&gt; and temporary staircasing at &lt;a href=&quot;http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/06/sao-paulo.html&quot;&gt;São Paulo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two teams on show were as bad as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/home/greece-world-cup-2014-team-profile&quot;&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt;, even more fitting the worst one qualified from the group. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-t7m36n9ARcE/U62FZiQLW5I/AAAAAAAAgEM/jyfjSz-p64U/s1600/c-4.JPG&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Curitiba, Brazil&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-t7m36n9ARcE/U62FZiQLW5I/AAAAAAAAgEM/jyfjSz-p64U/s1600/c-4.JPG&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; title=&quot;Curitiba&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bearing in mind my condition I decided to leave early, I had seen a sign for taxis and changed my mind at the last minute and headed for that. It was pitch black and it was difficult to follow the signs but I believed it was straight on. I expected to find a row of taxis waiting. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hobbled to the edge of the 2km exclusion zone, a common feature around the grounds.  Then asked a policeman where the taxis were he just pointed out into the street to the queuing traffic. (Note to self. Stick to original plan). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I kept going and found a taxi arriving 20 minutes before departure. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After that I think I need to put my foot up for 14 and three quarter hours, as I travel back to &lt;a href=&quot;http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/06/belo-horizonte.html&quot;&gt;Belo Horizonte&lt;/a&gt; where this all began.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ross Clegg &amp;amp; Soccerphile.com&lt;/b&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/feeds/3590346755770829271/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7424337262078805962&amp;postID=3590346755770829271' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/3590346755770829271'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/3590346755770829271'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/06/curitiba.html' title='Curitiba'/><author><name>Soccerphile</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='6' src='http://bp3.blogger.com/_USzog_GOzyA/R-enhnyI37I/AAAAAAAADcs/gy7OPVaMJSY/S220/japan-visitor-logo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-tSJlWwT1Bf4/U62FY9aZYWI/AAAAAAAAgEE/Ee9nTS-dZ5s/s72-c/c-1.JPG" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total><georss:featurename>Curitiba - Parana, Brazil</georss:featurename><georss:point>-25.4200388 -49.265097299999979</georss:point><georss:box>-25.8786733 -49.910544299999977 -24.9614043 -48.619650299999982</georss:box></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7424337262078805962.post-7160881351100185620</id><published>2014-06-26T08:15:00.001+01:00</published><updated>2014-11-05T04:45:43.090Z</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2014"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2014 World Cup"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Argentina"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Brazil"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Leo Messi"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Nigeria"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Porto Alegre"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Ross Clegg"/><title type='text'>Porto Alegre</title><content type='html'>I had felt something on the sole of my right foot over the last few days, at first it felt like a heat spot, itchy.

(You may have noticed I don&#39;t do photos of myself so I&#39;ll spare you from the evidence at this stage!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yRl76422Uf8/U6vHpnkXZEI/AAAAAAAAgDk/yLEt1e1UPUY/s1600/pa2.JPG&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Footsie&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yRl76422Uf8/U6vHpnkXZEI/AAAAAAAAgDk/yLEt1e1UPUY/s1600/pa2.JPG&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; title=&quot;Footsie&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Took Adidas trainer off at night and found in the morning that my foot had swollen up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thinking ahead, in Curitiba (now two days away) I have 45 minutes to get from the stadium to the bus station to catch an overnight bus ... distance  around 4km, easy to do with a quick exit and jog back with my bag which now weighs much less and so is no trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Juliana in Rio, expressed surprise when she realised that I had been out from early morning until around 8p.m. I thought about it, it&#39;s just what I do. Constantly on the go, in a country new to me  with so many things to see, there is always something to go and see. Brazilian maps don&#39;t help, they do not believe in showing the scale of the map, and things are always further away than you think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arriving in Porto Alegre I loosened my shoelace and shoehorned my foot back into my Adidas (looking for sponsors) trainers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Camila, (I met in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/soccerphile/news/balkans-soccer/zagreb-guide.html&quot;&gt;Zagreb&lt;/a&gt; last December I carried her bag to the bus station and she invited me to Porto Alegre) was waiting patiently as the bus arrived one hour late mainly due to a police security check when they boarded the bus and collected everyone&#39;s passports. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She gave me a quick guided tour of the city centre and confessed that there was nothing here. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Porto Alegre is another huge city home to 4 million. It sits on the shores of Lake Guaíba which is polluted. Government programmes have been put in place to start to clean the lake but in Brazil they like to start new projects not finish old ones. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We took the bus to her family house in the south of the city. A one hour ride in, at times, heavily congested traffic, part of the reason for this is the mass of Argentinians arriving in town (so far estimated at 100,000). We passed a short stretch of monorail (another unfinished project) and she showed me a favela that the foreigners were not meant to see. In all the cities the police cleared the favelas that were near the stadiums so there would be no unfavourable comments. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Camila&#39;s family house (with security by Ken Bates ...live, yes an electric fence) is beautiful. I had her brother&#39;s bedroom and bathroom. Found there were four bathrooms inside and one outside. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-iP_Ghc4dPS0/U6vHpvV5Z6I/AAAAAAAAgDc/vNOLI-s0jPE/s1600/pa3.JPG&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Pizza ice cream&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-iP_Ghc4dPS0/U6vHpvV5Z6I/AAAAAAAAgDc/vNOLI-s0jPE/s1600/pa3.JPG&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; title=&quot;Pizza ice cream&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We went for Pizza Brazilian style, where for a set price you could eat as much as you wanted. The waiters come round and offer you a slice, from a variety of different flavours - all very nice. Then when you are ready for dessert they swop your plate and do the same but this time the choice of pizza toppings were chocolate with either ice cream, strawberries or bananas. Not sure it will catch on back home, but I enjoyed it and Camila&#39;s company as she told me more about life in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/home/brazil&quot;&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that Brazil had banned alcohol  in stadiums some time ago in a measure to combat hooliganism, but for the World Cup it was on sale. FIFA insisted. This was a sensible government initiative, overturned for FIFA&#39;s commercial gain. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also learnt that the government had cancelled all armed forces and police leave enabling a high visibility of security (Fortaleza?) during the World Cup. Also that the government had asked the drug dealers to be calm during the World Cup. Once the World Cup is over there will be a high number of security personnel on holiday and the drug dealers will be back on the streets. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Camila told me that she had joined in the protests last year when they called for health and social reforms. She explained that within a week the chanting turned to overthrowing the government and reinstating the military dictatorship. Camila did not protest again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The government has started projects to encourage students to go abroad to study, so they are trying and there have been years of neglect. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back home I met Camila&#39;s Mum, Dad, brother (sporting an Arsenal shirt) I know the majority of the household support Gremio (4-1 only mum supports Internacional). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-izPNxRhTgts/U6vHpi-h8wI/AAAAAAAAgDY/dQwyMi4OzfI/s1600/pa1.JPG&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Porto Alegre Central Market, Brazil&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-izPNxRhTgts/U6vHpi-h8wI/AAAAAAAAgDY/dQwyMi4OzfI/s1600/pa1.JPG&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; title=&quot;Porto Alegre Central Market&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her brother tried to improve his English by drinking Caipirinha, no matter how much he drank it didn&#39;t seem to work. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They then took an interest in my foot which was by now even more swollen. They asked if I was in pain! I acknowledged &quot;A little&quot;. Those of you who know me will understand that means I would not be available for football this particular Thursday night. Mum  (in one of her three jobs) is a nurse and had a look. She thinks it is a bite. She asked if I had been on the beach... I had but not with my shoes off. She then thought there must be something in my shoe, so she got my Adidas trainer and bravely put her in hand.... out dropped a piece of fluff. Nothing else. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We agreed to review the situation in the morning. I went to bed with three pillows at the bottom of the bed to help keep my foot elevated, and woke to find the swelling had thankfully gone down. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Breakfast was great. Warm milk with honey, and a range of different spreads  laid out, amongst them dulce de leche... no need for pills or medication if I have this. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A morning resting, and tasting Camila&#39;s home made Brigadeirio (delicious sweet and sticky chocolate) before heading for the stadium where my first task was to get a Brahma cup with Argentina v Nigeria on it. (The things I do!!!). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I completed this task I headed for first aid. I explained, and they had a look. They did some tests and recorded the details, they could not say what has happened but said I could watch the match and gave me a prescription... didn&#39;t see dulce de leche  or Bramha on it though. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-q-U313FbrLM/U6vHqQi3-ZI/AAAAAAAAgDg/yNjVWvZN4lY/s1600/pa4.JPG&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Nigeria v Argentina, Porto Alegre&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-q-U313FbrLM/U6vHqQi3-ZI/AAAAAAAAgDg/yNjVWvZN4lY/s1600/pa4.JPG&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; title=&quot;Nigeria v Argentina&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back in 2005 I attended the U20 World Cup final played between (you guessed) Nigeria and Argentina.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Argentina won 2-1 thanks to two penalties thanks to a man we now know as Argentina&#39;s No10. But the most memorable thing about the day was the winning celebrations. Argentina were booed as they went round the pitch as the crowd felt that Argentina had been outplayed and that Nigeria were the better team. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking through the line ups for that game you would recognise Argentinians (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/soccerphile/players/lionel-messi.html&quot;&gt;Messi&lt;/a&gt;, Aguero, Zabaletta and Gago) the only Nigerian recognisable was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/soccerphile/news/ranter/john-obi-mikel.html&quot;&gt;John Obi Mickel&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So a chance for revenge for Nigeria! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 3rd place game played before featured Brazil, not one of the players that played that day made it into their 2014 World Cup squad, when they managed to turn around an 88th minute deficit into a 2-1 win against Morocco. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You could, if you wanted, count the number of Nigerians. On percentage of capacity this was the largest following. Strict policing on the way in meant I did not find out about the black market for this one. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The game itself had similarities to the one nine years ago. Argentina won by one goal, Messi scored twice. The Brazilians in the crowd jeered the Argentinian win. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next stop &lt;a href=&quot;http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/06/curitiba.html&quot;&gt;Curitiba&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;© Ross Clegg &amp;amp; Soccerphile.com&lt;/b&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/feeds/7160881351100185620/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7424337262078805962&amp;postID=7160881351100185620' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/7160881351100185620'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/7160881351100185620'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/06/porto-alegre.html' title='Porto Alegre'/><author><name>Soccerphile</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='6' src='http://bp3.blogger.com/_USzog_GOzyA/R-enhnyI37I/AAAAAAAADcs/gy7OPVaMJSY/S220/japan-visitor-logo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yRl76422Uf8/U6vHpnkXZEI/AAAAAAAAgDk/yLEt1e1UPUY/s72-c/pa2.JPG" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total><georss:featurename>Porto Alegre - Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil</georss:featurename><georss:point>-30.0346471 -51.217658400000005</georss:point><georss:box>-30.4742031 -51.8631054 -29.5950911 -50.572211400000008</georss:box></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7424337262078805962.post-1665881003569842809</id><published>2014-06-24T12:18:00.004+01:00</published><updated>2014-10-27T09:52:03.799Z</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2014"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2014 World Cup"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Brazil"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Ross Clegg"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Sao Paulo"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="World Cup 2014"/><title type='text'>Sao Paulo</title><content type='html'>Arriving in São Paulo it actually looked like winter in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/home/brazil&quot;&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; for the first time. The sky was grey and on the bus (as always) it felt cold due to the air conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decision time again. I had thought about going to the Football Museum first thing, partly because I thought there might be the opportunity of meeting someone who just happened to have a spare ticket. But it is closed on Mondays. Other options were also closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-USizStglWjU/U6lb3jbz5aI/AAAAAAAAgB0/i2Mzz3W-jGU/s1600/sao-paulo-4.JPG&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Looking for tickets in Sao Paulo&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-USizStglWjU/U6lb3jbz5aI/AAAAAAAAgB0/i2Mzz3W-jGU/s1600/sao-paulo-4.JPG&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; title=&quot;Sao Paulo&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So instead I headed straight to the stadium, on an express Metro train arriving at 10a.m. three hours before kick off. During the journey as I talked to people it was clear there were a lot of Chileans without tickets, and they were willing to pay big money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were lots of people at the station and I figured my best chance was to catch someone as they exited the station. I wasn&#39;t the only one who thought that, as there were at least 20 people milling about looking for tickets. I decided to target the Dutch as they would understand English. I had three separate offers of US $ 1000 which I politely declined. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-GPUjRCKv0VM/U6lb3IRAgGI/AAAAAAAAgB4/5-TQJiYvOFA/s1600/sao-paulo-3.JPG&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Free hugs in Sao Paulo&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-GPUjRCKv0VM/U6lb3IRAgGI/AAAAAAAAgB4/5-TQJiYvOFA/s1600/sao-paulo-3.JPG&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; title=&quot;Free hugs in Sao Paulo&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Took solace in the local&#39;s free offer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then appropriately, after 90 minutes a family exiting the Metro said apologetically they had only one ticket. &quot;How much,&quot;I asked. &quot;Face value.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sun has just come out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mVt77cbf64g/U6lb4UmC1EI/AAAAAAAAgCE/StrzzRSw-3k/s1600/sao-paulo-6.JPG&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Holland v Chile&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mVt77cbf64g/U6lb4UmC1EI/AAAAAAAAgCE/StrzzRSw-3k/s1600/sao-paulo-6.JPG&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; title=&quot;Holland v Chile&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The metro is right next to the stadium but it took another 30 minutes to enter the stadium, which looks to be the pick of the ones I have seen - today was number 7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the game, Brazil were on next but I opted to go to Ibirequera for a bit of peace and quiet...and to see some more of Oscar&#39;s work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zW5Mvz1pnAs/U6lb3IvIaWI/AAAAAAAAgCA/9gM1LoZD8-0/s1600/sao-paulo-2.JPG&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Sao Paulo architecture&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zW5Mvz1pnAs/U6lb3IvIaWI/AAAAAAAAgCA/9gM1LoZD8-0/s1600/sao-paulo-2.JPG&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; title=&quot;Sao Paulo architecture&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would you believe the rest if my day was ruined by football. There was a heavy military presence on Paulista Avenue, and they had blocked some roads meaning I couldn&#39;t find what I was looking for. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the shops and restaurants were closed, many of them with the workers inside glued to the TV, I watched in a bar for a while, but preferred walking round and listening to what was happening. Each Brazil goal was greeted with a loud cheer and people running out of the building. At the end of the match firecrackers went off all over the place and car alarms sounded. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JlYmo3pw8As/U6lb4CAZELI/AAAAAAAAgB8/kAfQGjy6Ul8/s1600/sao-paulo-5.JPG&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Watching Brazil in Sao Paulo&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JlYmo3pw8As/U6lb4CAZELI/AAAAAAAAgB8/kAfQGjy6Ul8/s1600/sao-paulo-5.JPG&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; title=&quot;Watching Brazil&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The restaurants failed to open after so I had to do with a snack, no need for McDonalds. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now off to catch the bus to &lt;a href=&quot;http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/06/porto-alegre.html&quot;&gt;Porto Alegre&lt;/a&gt;, just a 15 hour trip. Where I trust Camila awaits to show me round the city. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gzcbdfk4k5g/U6lb3J6WUkI/AAAAAAAAgBk/jWwCKQLat_s/s1600/sao-paulo-1.JPG&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Sao Paulo Cathedral (Se)&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gzcbdfk4k5g/U6lb3J6WUkI/AAAAAAAAgBk/jWwCKQLat_s/s1600/sao-paulo-1.JPG&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; title=&quot;Sao Paulo Cathedral (Se)&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;© Ross Clegg &amp;amp; Soccerphile.com&lt;/b&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/feeds/1665881003569842809/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7424337262078805962&amp;postID=1665881003569842809' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/1665881003569842809'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/1665881003569842809'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/06/sao-paulo.html' title='Sao Paulo'/><author><name>Soccerphile</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='6' src='http://bp3.blogger.com/_USzog_GOzyA/R-enhnyI37I/AAAAAAAADcs/gy7OPVaMJSY/S220/japan-visitor-logo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-USizStglWjU/U6lb3jbz5aI/AAAAAAAAgB0/i2Mzz3W-jGU/s72-c/sao-paulo-4.JPG" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total><georss:featurename>São Paulo - State of São Paulo, Brazil</georss:featurename><georss:point>-23.5505199 -46.633309399999973</georss:point><georss:box>-24.4811409 -47.924202899999976 -22.619898900000003 -45.34241589999997</georss:box></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7424337262078805962.post-5133366868470846345</id><published>2014-06-23T05:06:00.002+01:00</published><updated>2014-11-05T04:45:53.757Z</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2014"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2014 World Cup"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Brazil"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Rio de Janeiro"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Ross Clegg"/><title type='text'>Arrival in Rio de Janeiro</title><content type='html'>Arrived safely at 8.a.m. Had to make a decision about what sights to see.

So, from the airport I caught a bus straight to Niteroi, a town across the bay from Rio.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was delighted to find, no hustle and bustle, there was a simple layout to the place, and it was designed by Oscar Niemeyer! So I took a tour, it actually felt like I was on holiday! At every turn on the coast, you could see a small pristine beach reminding of those I had seen near &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/soccerphile/wc2010/city_guide/cape-town.html&quot;&gt;Cape Town&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dNcN_3BTGMA/U6efu2XDwZI/AAAAAAAAgAo/U7zlUU6jGSk/s1600/rio-8.JPG&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Oscar Niemeyer Museum, Niteroi&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dNcN_3BTGMA/U6efu2XDwZI/AAAAAAAAgAo/U7zlUU6jGSk/s1600/rio-8.JPG&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; title=&quot;Oscar Niemeyer Museum, Niteroi, Rio&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The houses with a view, back over to Rio, made me think of those on the Amalfi coast in Positano, and Oscar&#39;s work in the MOMA in New York (of course now every time I see that I will think of Oscar.) Plus the beaches have goalposts set up on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-rYrkq3-iG9c/U6efuaDqmeI/AAAAAAAAgAc/Lmtjxkm57YM/s1600/rio-7.JPG&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Sugerloaf Mountain&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-rYrkq3-iG9c/U6efuaDqmeI/AAAAAAAAgAc/Lmtjxkm57YM/s1600/rio-7.JPG&quot; height=&quot;320&quot; title=&quot;Sugerloaf Mountain&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get back to Rio I decided to catch the ferry (It cost £2, o. k. a bit more than the 50 cents for the Staten Island ferry) but just as good as the clouds lifted and I saw Cristo Redontor for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I walked from the port to Central metro station and was amazed that it felt so calm. After all this time travelling you may have thought I would feel tired, well I haven&#39;t. I can only guess it is my Lust for Life (Iggy Pop) that keeps me going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-y1jGUha2NPI/U6efuC83C6I/AAAAAAAAgAs/hvo-mmH0RCA/s1600/rio-5.JPG&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Teatro Popular, Niteroi&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-y1jGUha2NPI/U6efuC83C6I/AAAAAAAAgAs/hvo-mmH0RCA/s1600/rio-5.JPG&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; title=&quot;Teatro Popular, Niteroi&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Found Juliana The Girl from Urca at my hostel. She gave me a few ideas of what I could do with my limited time. So the evening I headed for the beach, Praia Vermelha, in the shadows of Sugarloaf mountain. The restaurant there had music, good food and outside once again the sound of the waves crashing on the shore. (An excellent recommendation).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next morning (the third time I have slept in a bed) I didn&#39;t feel so good. I don&#39;t know what I had eaten that had caused this. So I took my time as I got up, instead of rushing straight out. My schedule means that I am on the road non stop for the next two days. (Nothing unusual, except not feeling so good). Might need to visit McDonalds. For those of you that don&#39;t understand wherever you are in the world McDonalds have clean toilets, so any problems that is where to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dZbyTdQnX78/U6eftHosPWI/AAAAAAAAgA4/LHs9Y5URHYg/s1600/rio-3.JPG&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Copacabana from Sugarloaf&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dZbyTdQnX78/U6eftHosPWI/AAAAAAAAgA4/LHs9Y5URHYg/s1600/rio-3.JPG&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; title=&quot;Copacabana from Sugarloaf&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set off an hour late to go up Sugar Mountain (think Where Eagles Dare). Cristo Redentor was still in the clouds but the view was clear from where I overlooked the sprawling city below. Still not 100% so decided to take my time enjoying the view. Whilst up there spotted some creatures (which I later found out were micos) playing in the trees at the top of Sugarloaf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-yn36Vi504sM/U6eftF4Tu6I/AAAAAAAAgAE/hEsRLGjgSPk/s1600/rio-2.JPG&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Micos&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-yn36Vi504sM/U6eftF4Tu6I/AAAAAAAAgAE/hEsRLGjgSPk/s1600/rio-2.JPG&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; title=&quot;Micos&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was like an extreme version of sumo wrestling where they try and push each other out the tree and then have to desperately cling on to a branch to prevent a messy end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaving Sugarloaf I saw the bus coming, but let it go as I didn&#39;t feel like running for it... as I normally would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pedro from Fortaleza has been in touch. The thieves struck again the next day. I have sent him an email asking if the police are doing anything or if he thinks they are involved. I await his reply with interest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-GGY-gBTqEZ8/U6eftGaREhI/AAAAAAAAgA0/DBHhN6yDHrE/s1600/rio-1.JPG&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Maracana&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-GGY-gBTqEZ8/U6eftGaREhI/AAAAAAAAgA0/DBHhN6yDHrE/s1600/rio-1.JPG&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; title=&quot;Maracana&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My next game is the first I do not (now) have a ticket for. So I have been paying attention to the black market. You know me by now, working all the angles... as well as the curves. Today Brazilians are trying to sell their tickets (the lowest category) for 10 times face value. I may have to accept that I won&#39;t see the game in the stadium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Walking up the tunnel to see the inside of the Maracana, it felt as though I would be walking out on to the pitch to play. Of course now that I have realised this dream my thoughts turn to Manuel&#39;s offer to come and see his team America in the Azteca. (Give me three years to sort that one out!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here in Rio (with a bit of help from Juliana) I think I have found my Brazilian home.  The city is calm, well policed, there are some wonderful areas, much preferred Ipanema to the touristy Copacabana and the weather has not been too hot. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Off shortly to get the 1.30a.m bus to &lt;a href=&quot;http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/06/sao-paulo.html&quot;&gt;São Paulo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;© Ross Clegg &amp;amp; Soccerphile.com&lt;/b&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/feeds/5133366868470846345/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7424337262078805962&amp;postID=5133366868470846345' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/5133366868470846345'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/5133366868470846345'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/06/arrival-in-rio-de-janeiro.html' title='Arrival in Rio de Janeiro'/><author><name>Soccerphile</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='6' src='http://bp3.blogger.com/_USzog_GOzyA/R-enhnyI37I/AAAAAAAADcs/gy7OPVaMJSY/S220/japan-visitor-logo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-VaMslQjOrHc/U6efvBT5_nI/AAAAAAAAgAw/DOgT_Bv2KHk/s72-c/rio-9.JPG" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total><georss:featurename>Rio - Rio de Janeiro, Brazil</georss:featurename><georss:point>-22.9082998 -43.197077299999989</georss:point><georss:box>-23.376327300000003 -43.842524299999987 -22.4402723 -42.551630299999992</georss:box></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7424337262078805962.post-7664852267898705713</id><published>2014-06-21T11:42:00.001+01:00</published><updated>2014-10-23T13:49:17.425+01:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2014"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2014 World Cup"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Brazil"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Recife"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="World Cup"/><title type='text'>Recife</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Caught the packed (sardines) metro from the bus station into the centre of town. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heard a guitar strumming and singing in Portugese, followed the sound and found myself in The Nossa Senhora Do Rosário Dos Pretos Church. &amp;nbsp;The acoustics were great and it sounded nothing like religious music so I sat in the church and enjoyed that for 30 minutes. The time now 7a.m. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2cmZyNFMuUw/U6VfwYLIpnI/AAAAAAAAf-M/anadi_s-7oI/s1600/Recife-1.JPG&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;The Nossa Senhora Do Rosario Dos Pretos Church&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2cmZyNFMuUw/U6VfwYLIpnI/AAAAAAAAf-M/anadi_s-7oI/s1600/Recife-1.JPG&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; title=&quot;The Nossa Senhora Do Rosario Dos Pretos Church&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Walked around and found the site of the first bridge in Latin America first built in 1643. As I was crossing I saw a net being thrown into the river on the next bridge. I was amazed to see one minute later the net hauled out with a large fish. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2V42qYGduXI/U6VgINrLCfI/AAAAAAAAf-U/1k1Sj4oYeNk/s1600/recife-2.JPG&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;The Nossa Senhora Do Rosario Dos Pretos Church&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2V42qYGduXI/U6VgINrLCfI/AAAAAAAAf-U/1k1Sj4oYeNk/s1600/recife-2.JPG&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; title=&quot;The Nossa Senhora Do Rosario Dos Pretos Church&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later walking down the street I saw a man drop his car keys, I picked them up and followed him, saying disculpe (excuse me) I got no reaction as he did not recognise his own keys. I demonstrated what had happened and he then realised they were his. I was rewarded with a coffee. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-k04bKzGc6BM/U6VgruJFbTI/AAAAAAAAf-g/MgH-NpeJe6U/s1600/recife-3.JPG&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Brazilian Post Box&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-k04bKzGc6BM/U6VgruJFbTI/AAAAAAAAf-g/MgH-NpeJe6U/s1600/recife-3.JPG&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; title=&quot;Brazilian Post Box&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#39;t mention it but in Brasilia I had a spare ticket for the game. I looked for someone suitable to give it to and saw 4 Brazilians under a tree, a father and three sons. I asked if they spoke English. They shook their heads. I asked if they wanted a ticket they said &quot;Yes&quot;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I told them they could have it but I was not going to be responsible for the battle over who would have the ticket, they understood every word. The eldest son came with me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-d6TMjehBNR8/U6Vg3QcVtfI/AAAAAAAAf-o/VF0JxqNjuvI/s1600/recife-4.JPG&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Architecture in Recife&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-d6TMjehBNR8/U6Vg3QcVtfI/AAAAAAAAf-o/VF0JxqNjuvI/s1600/recife-4.JPG&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; title=&quot;Architecture in Recife&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mentioned a problem a mutual friend had yesterday, well someone was arrested... correctly. They confessed that before they were caught they had also left a restaurant without paying, and so they accepted that they were being punished for this. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thinking about how to get dulce de leche. I remember after my visit to Uruguay finding it in Sainsbury&#39;s. Then I thought.... just now Uruguay is closer! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vuy0WBOIBxM/U6VhFQS4xvI/AAAAAAAAf-w/Mzv7QWeucDw/s1600/recife-6.JPG&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Sugar cane&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vuy0WBOIBxM/U6VhFQS4xvI/AAAAAAAAf-w/Mzv7QWeucDw/s1600/recife-6.JPG&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; title=&quot;Sugar cane&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still wandering around I saw sugar Kane (not distilled) and as is customary had a drink. The vendor had no change for the small note I gave her, so I had a fresh fruit concoction sprinkled with cream, raisins and something else, for the note. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recife has some wonderful (restored) colonial architecture, recently repainted, with the clear blue early morning sky there were plenty of good photos to be had for anyone with a decent camera. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1hKE8ao5eaY/U6VhVKLFf_I/AAAAAAAAf-4/Jg7MHC0zvHU/s1600/recife-5.JPG&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Recife architecture&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1hKE8ao5eaY/U6VhVKLFf_I/AAAAAAAAf-4/Jg7MHC0zvHU/s1600/recife-5.JPG&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; title=&quot;Recife architecture&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first time there were people at the metro to help visitors and there was security present... unlike Fortaleza, where I put forward my proposals to make the&amp;nbsp;places&amp;nbsp;safe for others in the future i.e. the police should be visible, to ward off criminals and not hiding in their office. Unfortunately the tourist police did not understand English.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manuel arrived at the game in customary fashion (i.e. late) and I didn&#39;t expect to be saying that Costa Rica are one of the best teams I have seen in my five games so far. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-x-gigpc6lSI/U6VhgTE9neI/AAAAAAAAf_A/bbtFM9HaiTo/s1600/recife-8.JPG&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Italy v Costa Rica&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-x-gigpc6lSI/U6VhgTE9neI/AAAAAAAAf_A/bbtFM9HaiTo/s1600/recife-8.JPG&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; title=&quot;Italy v Costa Rica&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Managed to send the previous day&#39;s blog thanks to Claudia63 sitting two seats away who was unaware I had hacked her wifi, using the Brazilian formula explained earlier. Found another way to access wifi through a local network Oi, they are linked to BT and as I have an account with them, using my BT password &amp;amp; username it works......when the network is strong enough. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the match, made the long trek back to the city centre, walk, bus and  packed metro. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had time to kill, it was just getting dark so I decided to head to the stop imaginatively titled &#39;Shopping&#39;. Brasilia had the same and there was a modern shopping centre next to the metro there. On the way I met two Norwegian, Chile fans. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time I got out the metro and realised this was not the same scenario. There was no sign of anything around a local woman assured us that Shopping was just round the corner. Then we saw a bus with the destination Shopping Recife, so we jumped on. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By now, I think you understand that Brazil is huge and so too are the cities. The bus travelled for about twenty minutes before we reached the shopping centre!  We then decided to head to the beach area Boa Viagem. We sat and talked as we listened to the waves crashing in the background. A very pleasant evening,  we tried to swop tales of our adventures in Brazil. I went first and they immediately said that there trip had been uneventful. I said I would be grateful for the day that my travels were. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realised they were trying to give me more material, as I left them about 10p.m. and headed to the airport for my 2.20a.m flight that would take me to São Paulo, where I would change planes before landing in Rio.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They helpfully suggested that I could catch the bus to the Airport from a nearby street, instead of the 10 minute walk back to the Shopping Centre. I pointed out that the stop they referred to was going in the wrong direction! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did however, check and sure enough I headed back to the shopping centre to catch the bus to the airport. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whilst completing computerised check-in I completed their questions, but am wondering what will happen next as they insisted on having a telephone number for next of kin (provided they were not also on the flight). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;© Ross Clegg &amp;amp; Soccerphile.com&lt;/b&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/feeds/7664852267898705713/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7424337262078805962&amp;postID=7664852267898705713' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/7664852267898705713'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/7664852267898705713'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/06/recife.html' title='Recife'/><author><name>Soccerphile</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='6' src='http://bp3.blogger.com/_USzog_GOzyA/R-enhnyI37I/AAAAAAAADcs/gy7OPVaMJSY/S220/japan-visitor-logo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2cmZyNFMuUw/U6VfwYLIpnI/AAAAAAAAf-M/anadi_s-7oI/s72-c/Recife-1.JPG" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>1</thr:total><georss:featurename>Recife - Pernambuco, Brazil</georss:featurename><georss:point>-8.0475458 -34.876962100000014</georss:point><georss:box>-8.2991048 -35.199685600000016 -7.7959868 -34.554238600000012</georss:box></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7424337262078805962.post-8254944766299751719</id><published>2014-06-20T17:31:00.002+01:00</published><updated>2014-11-05T04:45:33.815Z</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2014"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2014 World Cup"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Brazil"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="FIFA World Cup"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Natal"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Ross Clegg"/><title type='text'>Natal</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-TI4_FdUGKC4/U6Rhi0TK3gI/AAAAAAAAf9g/0RGy4wKEpts/s1600/brazil-2014.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Natal, Brazil&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-TI4_FdUGKC4/U6Rhi0TK3gI/AAAAAAAAf9g/0RGy4wKEpts/s1600/brazil-2014.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Natal&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Caught the overnight bus from Fortaleza....just seven hours this time and arrived at 6 a.m. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arriving in Natal as dawn broke it was clear they had heavy rain in the night. As it began to get light there were still grey clouds overhead. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I needed to sort out how I was getting to Recife for the game at 1.00 p.m. tomorrow, the original plan was that I was travelling with Manuel by car, you&#39;ll realize after &lt;a href=&quot;http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/06/robbed-in-fortaleza.html&quot;&gt;yesterday&#39;s episode that something went wrong with those plans&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lots of Mexicans here and they are doing the same thing, so it was no surprise when I heard the buses to Recife were full. Of course being one who doesn&#39;t give up I persisted and managed to book a bus out at 23.45 tonight, for the five hour journey. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what to do in Brazil by the sea as the rain pours down? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Head to the mall for some shopping (to replace things) and where the FIFA ticketing centre was located. There was no sign of any local buses, so I had no option but to take a taxi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the journey my driver talked (as taxi drivers all over the world do) non stop. Despite neither of us speaking each other&#39;s language I think we understood each other. This was borne out by the fact that he accompanied me to the ticketing centre and explained my case and remained with me for the next two hours. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understood that Natal was safe but that Recife was dangerous and had a reputation for &lt;a href=&quot;http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/06/robbed-in-fortaleza.html&quot;&gt;crime like Fortaleza&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was now told that FIFA had said yesterday that under no circumstances would they reissue tickets. Keeping quiet about the fact that I had done that yesterday I said I accepted that, but would like to see if it was possible to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/home/football-tickets&quot;&gt;buy tickets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again I was told this was not possible. Yet outside a large queue had formed obviously looking for tickets for tonight&#39;s game &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/home/japan-world-cup-2014-team-profile&quot;&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; v &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/home/greece-world-cup-2014-team-profile&quot;&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ko0oiXM2ej4/U6Vb37GO5VI/AAAAAAAAf94/lP_bowt-Y-Y/s1600/japan-greece.JPG&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Japan v Greece, Natal&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ko0oiXM2ej4/U6Vb37GO5VI/AAAAAAAAf94/lP_bowt-Y-Y/s1600/japan-greece.JPG&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; title=&quot;Japan v Greece&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My FIFA helper took pity and asked about the games I needed. He tried but no luck, he suggested trying the Internet. He saw my iPod and asked if I had wifi, I explained that even when I get it it rarely works (as I was advised by Camila before I set off. Thank you.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He proceeded to try the different networks that came up and (as I had already worked out) entered the same name for the password. I told him that was typical Brazilian and he acknowledged it was. Nothing worked so he suggested a large nearby supermarket which had Internet. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Cw5GDQUxLQY/U6VcGt2GcyI/AAAAAAAAf-A/U74JFGJKcpg/s1600/japan-fans.JPG&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Japan fans in Natal, Brazil&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Cw5GDQUxLQY/U6VcGt2GcyI/AAAAAAAAf-A/U74JFGJKcpg/s1600/japan-fans.JPG&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; title=&quot;Japan fans in Natal&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I asked a few questions and found that initially he didn&#39;t know if the shopping mall would open today as on match days the cities had declared holidays. He later found it would open at 3p.m.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He also informed me that there was a bus strike today. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So off to the supermarket where I got to kick my first ball in the aisles, with some kids before we got told off! I took one of the chocolate world cups off the shelf and gave it to one of them who then paraded it round the store, before putting it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The connection to the Internet was slow and when it did come up it failed, after my third computer I looked at the assistants and said &quot;Brazil&quot; they immediately fell about laughing. I had read that Brazilians say this when things don&#39;t work out, and felt that after the week here that I have had, I was entitled to use it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it would appear my only hope for the two missing tickets will be Pedro&#39;s sign. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess by now you&#39;ll realize  at the moment I feel a bit like the Uruguayans without their dulce du leche (which is as good as sugar Kane!). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looked for some help to get to the stadium later in the day and found two people from England, who having been based on the Northern coast, were able to give me useful tips for my next destination. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Met another old friend, by chance, inside the stadium, Sebastian can be found usually near beautiful women. I spotted him having his photo taken and ruined the shot! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first time I managed to watch a game on TV. It left me singing &quot;Soy, celeste&quot; as I later watched Japan v Greece from the best seats I have had this tournament. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By now you will have seen that the stadiums have all been magnificent (as usual) but I heard that for the last game it took some time to get back into town. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I planned my escape from the stadium beforehand by foot to the bus station.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the way out I bumped into another friend, and went with them for the bus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of his companions had been arrested earlier in the evening, (for nothing, honest) and kept in custody whilst the game took place and he was due to appear in court at 8.20 a.m. tomorrow morning. But the bus to &lt;a href=&quot;http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/06/recife.html&quot;&gt;Recife&lt;/a&gt; departed tonight....with him on board.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;© Ross Clegg &amp;amp; Soccerphile.com&lt;/b&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/feeds/8254944766299751719/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7424337262078805962&amp;postID=8254944766299751719' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/8254944766299751719'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/8254944766299751719'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/06/natal.html' title='Natal'/><author><name>Soccerphile</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='6' src='http://bp3.blogger.com/_USzog_GOzyA/R-enhnyI37I/AAAAAAAADcs/gy7OPVaMJSY/S220/japan-visitor-logo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-TI4_FdUGKC4/U6Rhi0TK3gI/AAAAAAAAf9g/0RGy4wKEpts/s72-c/brazil-2014.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total><georss:featurename>Natal - Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil</georss:featurename><georss:point>-5.7792569 -35.200916000000007</georss:point><georss:box>-6.0320144 -35.523639500000009 -5.5264994 -34.878192500000004</georss:box></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7424337262078805962.post-1516355721197054130</id><published>2014-06-19T09:33:00.000+01:00</published><updated>2014-11-05T04:46:05.788Z</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2014 World Cup"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Brazil"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Crime"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Fortleza"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Robbery"/><title type='text'>Robbed in Fortaleza</title><content type='html'>The bus set off 45 minutes late on it 1679 km journey to Fortaleza on the Brazilian coast. It was scheduled to arrive at 09.51 little did I know that it was Tuesday and not Monday it was due to arrive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-I0TPdFbtIBU/U6KgLDYIVxI/AAAAAAAAf9Q/JQUzOKkfyGQ/s1600/fortaleza.JPG&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Arena Castellao, Fortaleza&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-I0TPdFbtIBU/U6KgLDYIVxI/AAAAAAAAf9Q/JQUzOKkfyGQ/s1600/fortaleza.JPG&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; title=&quot;Arena Castellao, Fortaleza&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So plenty of time to admire the Brazilian countryside as the bus took in all the towns on the way, and my fellow passengers were always eager to get off and try the local delicacies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my extended trip acquainted me with all the gastronomic delights served at their bus stations. I can assure you that I tried everything at least once and still don&#39;t know exactly what I had. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 7a.m. on Tuesday I checked with my fellow passengers and they confirmed there was 3 hours to go. At noon I checked and there was still 3 hours to go!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kick off was at 4p.m. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No panic. Taxi! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again I took my bags to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/home/world-cup-2014-stadiums-brazil&quot;&gt;stadium&lt;/a&gt;, and had to walk the last 2km as no cars were allowed near the stadium. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon arrival at the security check, this time, they spotted my razor and informed that I could not go in with it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#39;s just recap here. I have just spent 45 hours on a bus. Had six hours in bed since I got to Brazil. Just walked 2km with my bags in the hottest temperatures I had encountered so far, now that I was on the North East coast. Oh and I hadn&#39;t had a shave since I got here. It can&#39;t get worse can it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I got in and I have now shaved. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoyed the game. Mexico&#39;s performance was no surprise to me as I have seen the fixture three times and Mexico won them all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had an early night ..11ish, and up at 7 to meet my Mexican friend Manuel at the bus station to travel to &lt;a href=&quot;http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/06/natal.html&quot;&gt;Natal&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were in the process of buying the bus tickets, I handed Manuel my passport from my small bag, I looked around some seconds later and immediately realised my bag had gone. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Want to know what was in it, with the most important things first. Match tickets, camera, hat, money, jacket, poncho. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I looked and looked for the police, eventually finding them exuding the same patience I had seen with their queues (even when the metro came in at Brasilia there was not the usual urgency I am used to, to get aboard). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The police did not seem to take an interest as I searched all the bins and the toilets. A Uruguayan girl said she had seen someone suspicous and we asked to check the CCTV, the nearest one wasn&#39;t working. But then Pedro the manager of Guanabara bus company came along. He checked his CCTV and we saw what had happened, two of them and two seconds. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We then went to the police and they then checked the video of the station exits. We saw the culprits but the police were not about to do anything. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pedro, however was determined to help he offered his services and drove Manuel and I across town to the Police Station to get a crime report. (Beach football today was postponed).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Found out from Pedro that Fortaleza is the 7th most violent city in the world and that a few years he had been visited at his home by armed robbers and tied up. I had only lost a bag. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pedro realised that the match tickets were the  most important thing and offered to take us to the FIFA ticketing centre. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Pedro and Manuel&#39;s help and patience I managed to get tickets to 5 of the 7 matches I had lost. One of Pedro&#39;s last acts if kindness was to make me a sign saying &quot;I need a ticket for this match.&quot;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;© Ross Clegg &amp;amp; Soccerphile.com&lt;/b&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/feeds/1516355721197054130/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7424337262078805962&amp;postID=1516355721197054130' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/1516355721197054130'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/1516355721197054130'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/06/robbed-in-fortaleza.html' title='Robbed in Fortaleza'/><author><name>Soccerphile</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='6' src='http://bp3.blogger.com/_USzog_GOzyA/R-enhnyI37I/AAAAAAAADcs/gy7OPVaMJSY/S220/japan-visitor-logo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-I0TPdFbtIBU/U6KgLDYIVxI/AAAAAAAAf9Q/JQUzOKkfyGQ/s72-c/fortaleza.JPG" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total><georss:featurename>Fortaleza - Ceará, Brazil</georss:featurename><georss:point>-3.7318616 -38.5266704</georss:point><georss:box>-3.9853661 -38.8493939 -3.4783570999999998 -38.2039469</georss:box></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7424337262078805962.post-1003720037585363194</id><published>2014-06-19T00:18:00.002+01:00</published><updated>2014-11-05T04:46:20.504Z</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Brazil"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Chile"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="FIFA 2014 World Cup"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Sean O&#39;Conor"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Spain"/><title type='text'>The reign of Spain ends in pain</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;of June 2014 will go down in Spanish history, that is for sure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;King Juan Carlos signed the papers to step down as monarch after 39 years on the throne and the national team were clinically excised from the World Cup, marking the definitive end of a golden age which began when Luis Aragones’ team won Euro 2008 espousing a glorious new creed called tiki-taka.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Even &lt;i&gt;El Pais&lt;/i&gt; newspaper was unsure which end of empire deserved higher billing on its front page, but there is no doubt which abdication will be the talk of the town tomorrow.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The  streets here in North-West Spain are eerily quiet. At 11pm  sharp someone turned off the usual volume. The rows of outdoor cafes either  emptied or were suddenly drained of their normal chatter and vivacity which  make this country a home of real nightlife.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The reason was &lt;i&gt;La Roja&lt;/i&gt;&#39;s sudden death in Brazil, hit by a left-right Dutch-Chilean combination. Two strikes and they’re out, the champs are going home.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;It&#39;s an early night for a nation which normally  stays up too late and the post-mortem has begun in earnest. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Two hours after the final whistle signalled the  death-knell of Spanish hopes, one all-male TV talk show was still  hollering away into the night about what went wrong. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;There  are the usual suspects of course but all the culprits are too numerous to mention.  Vicente Del Bosque keeping faith with old friends, Iker Casillas&#39; and  Sergio Ramos&#39; loss of form and Diego Costa&#39;s incompatibility are nevertheless the immediate targets.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;But you could easily add the injury to Thiago Alcantara, leaving Santi Cazorla, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Cesc  Fabregas, Juan Mata and David Villa languishing on the bench, the Brazilian grass,  the heat and humidity, victory fatigue, FIFA&#39;s screwed-up rankings which dropped the  unseeded Dutch into their group and the fact Madrid&#39;s players had&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt; landed jaded from the Champions League final.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Spain were lethargic and were unable to up the  tempo when required or match the explosiveness of the Chilean or Dutch  attacks. Even when forcing the other Roja&#39;s custodian Claudio Bravo into action in the second half,  they never looked like pulling back the half-time deficit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The 5-1 mauling by the Netherlands should have been proof enough that Spain were old news, but &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;in reality &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;the  writing was on the wall last summer when Del Bosque&#39;s team were out-run by Brazil in the Confederations Cup final.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Of course no empire can last forever and beyond the eternal and necessary optimism of any football supporter, there was a feeling here in Spain before the finals that this was a cup too far.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;I told you so may be a glib reaction to defeat, but I at least thought something looked amiss in the curiously half-hearted displays of red and yellow flags around this town. I also felt a faint desperation at the back of my mind watching old faces in new adverts from the myriad sponsors on television and in the press. Yes we can they grinned, no you can&#39;t I thought.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;How proud really is Cruzcampo to be the beer of a dreadful team? The official sorrow-drowner more like. And how many despondent fans will cut themselves tomorrow morning with Gillette, Spain&#39;s official razor?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;What is really sad though is that tiki-taka, that delightfully innovative style of play, had already  left the building before the World Cup began. And its great wizard Xavi did not even take the field tonight while Andres  Iniesta failed to conjure up his magic of old.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Yet at 0-2 down, just when Spain needed a return to &lt;i&gt;La Furia Roja&lt;/i&gt; of yesteryear, nothing happened as the tank was empty. Chile were faster, fitter and fresher and the crown was falling fast off the world champions&#39; head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Costa has never looked the part for Spain and  leaves his native country Brazil with his held held low. La Roja&#39;s blunt  forward line was of no help to the cause. Seven corners to Chile&#39;s one,  16 shots to eight and 63% of the ball mean nothing when you never looked  like scoring.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;And so the fire of a world-beating national team  goes out, a light which paradoxically began to burn brightly at  the same time the Spanish nation fell into a dark fiscal and social crisis with a flat-lining economy and  large-scale emigration.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Now the great team is dead, while the country struggles on in hope of better days. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Spain has lost a king and a dynasty tonight.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;(c) Sean O&#39;Conor &amp;amp; Soccerphile&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/feeds/1003720037585363194/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7424337262078805962&amp;postID=1003720037585363194' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/1003720037585363194'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/1003720037585363194'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/06/the-reign-of-spain-ends-in-pain.html' title='The reign of Spain ends in pain'/><author><name>Sean O&#39;Conor</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='33' height='20' src='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_alcLfIha2wA/SfGD9nB7_6I/AAAAAAAAA9w/hefDCUsPw00/S220/puma.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7424337262078805962.post-4845621341122666803</id><published>2014-06-18T04:30:00.001+01:00</published><updated>2014-11-05T04:46:49.981Z</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2014"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Brasilia"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Brazil"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Fortaleza"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Ross Clegg"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="World Cup 2014"/><title type='text'>Brasilia</title><content type='html'>Well, I went for the bus, waiting where I thought it was going from at the main bus station on the platform as stated on my ticket. With only ten minutes before departure I checked where fellow passengers were going - none were going to Brasilia!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Z249DqGoPKY/U6EFXL_pBoI/AAAAAAAAf78/9cdVTSxNIEE/s1600/photo.JPG&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Brazil World Cup 2014&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Z249DqGoPKY/U6EFXL_pBoI/AAAAAAAAf78/9cdVTSxNIEE/s1600/photo.JPG&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; title=&quot;Brazil World Cup 2014&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Found someone who worked at the bus station and they confirmed the bus was due to depart from another bus station, they wrote the address down and sent me towards the taxi rank with a bit of paper. (Looks like I might break all the rules on this trip!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taxi driver understood I was in a hurry and made his way hastily across town, some 15 minutes later we arrived and my bus had gone.  I explained at the ticket office, and they put me on the next bus which departed 20 minutes after mine. They then took me to the bus station I had come from.  I was told I should wait here, I was soon joined by 6 others who had also missed the bus!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Included in this motley crew were 2 South Koreans who kept our spirits up by sharing their Korean octopus sausage and a Brazilian doctor travelling with his son. He said that if he didn&#39;t know where to catch the bus then no wonder the foreigners had problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FgOkfprDz58/U6EGy4DExJI/AAAAAAAAf8Q/HjcP1sTfj5w/s1600/photo+(3).JPG&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Brasilia Cathedral, Brazil&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FgOkfprDz58/U6EGy4DExJI/AAAAAAAAf8Q/HjcP1sTfj5w/s1600/photo+(3).JPG&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; title=&quot;Brasilia Cathedral&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bus came in about 20 minutes and the other 6 got on. I was to wait.... and wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whilst waiting I considered my options I could go back to my bar. (It was samba tonight and I knew my friends would be there) that wouldn&#39;t be so bad.  Two hours after my scheduled departure time and I was finally on my way. 11 hours later and I was in Brasilia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had done my homework as I didn&#39;t have much time here...so here you are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brasilia is the only city in the world constructed in the 20th century to have been declared a World Heritage site by UNESCO. The city was built in 41 months, and is considered a masterpiece of modernist architecture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mDlLA_WrPnM/U6EHHRFkl2I/AAAAAAAAf8Y/ouggowh1IkM/s1600/photo+(4).JPG&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Museu Nacional, Brasilia, Brazil&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mDlLA_WrPnM/U6EHHRFkl2I/AAAAAAAAf8Y/ouggowh1IkM/s1600/photo+(4).JPG&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; title=&quot;Museu Nacional, Brasilia&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Juscelino Kubitschek was president of Brazil from 1956 to 1961, this time was unusual as there was a period of political calm. He was responsible for the plan of National Development, which carried the motto &quot;50 years of progress in 5.” (Shame they didn&#39;t bring that one back!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He transferred the capital of Brazil away from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/home/rio-rising-rio-de-janeiro-guide&quot;&gt;Rio de Janeiro&lt;/a&gt; to Brasilia. The idea of moving the capital to somewhere central had been around since 1891 (possibly after Italian saint Don Bosco had a prophetic dream in 1883 in which he described a futuristic city that roughly fitted Brasilia&#39;s location) but he made it happen. The new modern capital would show the world that Brazil had broken from its colonial past, whilst at the same time boosting industry and initiating major construction projects. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Di5VdJQvkng/U6EHWxEjACI/AAAAAAAAf8g/xEOezpBwvDc/s1600/photo+(5).JPG&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Palace of Congress, Brasilia, Brazil&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Di5VdJQvkng/U6EHWxEjACI/AAAAAAAAf8g/xEOezpBwvDc/s1600/photo+(5).JPG&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; title=&quot;Palace of Congress, Brasilia&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A design competition was arranged for the building of the new city and this was won by Lucio Costa, who enlisted the help of Oscar Niemeyer (whom he had been working with on a new Ministry of Education and Health in Rio de Janiero collaborating with Le Corbusier).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kubitschek attracted foreign capital by exempting taxes and had a generous credit policy. Of course he was accused of corruption, mainly around the awarding of construction contracts,  but nothing was ever proven.  He left office in 1961 with foreign debt having grown from 87 million dollars to 297 million dollars and inflation running at 43%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the military seized power in 1964 his political rights were suspended and he went into a self imposed exile. he returned to Brazil in 1967 and was killed in a car crash in 1976. In 2000 Leonel Brizola, the former governor of Rio de Janeiro alleged he was assassinated, this was proven in 2013, but corrected in 2014 to say it was a genuine accident!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, arriving in Brasilia an hour later than planned at 8a.m. I checked my bag in the left luggage without a problem and collected my bus ticket to Fortaleza which was due to depart at 17.15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had read that I needed to get a bus to travel the 7 miles to the centre, but I found a Metro system in operation. You could tell it was new as they had only done the outlines for the graffiti on the front of the building.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arriving in the centre I headed for Tres Poddres square, where Niemeyer&#39;s National Congress Building was the main show piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Niemeyer was  certainly ahead of his time in architectural terms, but here in Brasilia it was to be the foundation of a city.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I found was Milton Keynes with American highways and underpasses instead of roundabouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Niemeyer is quoted as saying &quot;It is strange how the power of beauty makes us forget so much injustice,&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-leODlKLdVO4/U6EHn4oK0DI/AAAAAAAAf8o/u-jlcwvkMj8/s1600/photo+(2).JPG&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Protester in Brasilia, Brazil&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-leODlKLdVO4/U6EHn4oK0DI/AAAAAAAAf8o/u-jlcwvkMj8/s1600/photo+(2).JPG&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; title=&quot;Protester in Brasilia, Brazil&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now recognised a familiar police presence outside each Government building. Today I met this lot near the Niemeyer museum. They explained there had been a small and peaceful protest because they were fed up with the Government.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish I had asked this lot what they thought of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrived back at the bus station. in plenty of time, but was getting worried as there was no sign of a bus at the due departure time. We eventually set off 45 minutes late. (Life&#39;s not fair). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;© Ross Clegg &amp;amp; Soccerphile.com&lt;/b&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/feeds/4845621341122666803/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7424337262078805962&amp;postID=4845621341122666803' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/4845621341122666803'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/4845621341122666803'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/06/brasilia.html' title='Brasilia'/><author><name>Soccerphile</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='6' src='http://bp3.blogger.com/_USzog_GOzyA/R-enhnyI37I/AAAAAAAADcs/gy7OPVaMJSY/S220/japan-visitor-logo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Z249DqGoPKY/U6EFXL_pBoI/AAAAAAAAf78/9cdVTSxNIEE/s72-c/photo.JPG" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total><georss:featurename>ブラジル</georss:featurename><georss:point>-14.235004 -51.925279999999987</georss:point><georss:box>-67.751949 -134.5424675 39.281941 30.691907500000013</georss:box></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7424337262078805962.post-7913839874446209378</id><published>2014-06-16T16:52:00.001+01:00</published><updated>2014-11-05T04:47:00.109Z</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2014 World Cup"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Belo Horizonte"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Brazil"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Colombia"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="greece"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="World Cup 2014"/><title type='text'>Belo Horizonte</title><content type='html'>Upon arrival at the airport picked up my remaining &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/home/football-tickets&quot;&gt;match tickets&lt;/a&gt; by simply placing the credit card used to purchase the tickets into a vending machine, due to planning ahead these tickets were in my name, so I didn&#39;t have any problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-96tKGlUPB3k/U58SG9RbSjI/AAAAAAAAf7k/7PqKG6iHpaM/s1600/belo-horizonte-1x.JPG&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Belo Horizonte, Brazil&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-96tKGlUPB3k/U58SG9RbSjI/AAAAAAAAf7k/7PqKG6iHpaM/s1600/belo-horizonte-1x.JPG&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; title=&quot;Belo Horizonte&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bus into town took about an hour and delivered us to the central bus station. The bus station is served by a metro station which I thought would be the best way to get around, however the locals say that the metro takes you from nothing to nowhere. Sure enough, nowhere near my accommodation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Belo Horizonte means beautiful horizon, and the city is surrounded by hills, think of a bigger Sheffield. I also noted that the city is partnered with Grimsby! The only link I could find was another local saying, that there is no sea, but there are bars. The saying rhymes well in Portugese. Trust me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway found my digs on the other side of town high upon one of the hills. Just further up (O.K. almost at the top is a small park in the shape if an inverted teardrop, it was built for the visit if the Pope in 1984 and from here you can see why the city got the name). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NHGmholQdWA/U58SSk3S8gI/AAAAAAAAf7s/0ecds5xrUS4/s1600/belo-horizonte-1.JPG&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Belo Horizonte architecture, Brazil&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NHGmholQdWA/U58SSk3S8gI/AAAAAAAAf7s/0ecds5xrUS4/s1600/belo-horizonte-1.JPG&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; title=&quot;Belo Horizonte&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The place I was staying was mainly full of Colombians, cheering on the Mexicans  cabrones on T.V.  As new people arrived they asked where they were from and invited them to join them drinking vodka. When they caught up with me they suddenly changed the drink to whisky! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From now at random they would shout out a country. Canada, Australia, Bolivia, Chile, and invite the person to drink. If you remember what they were drinking I was asked every second time! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heard there had been some life in an area called Savassi last night and so headed down there in the afternoon. The hills were like the ones you see in San Francisco. (No amount of training on the steepest part of the Forest was going to help me get back up). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whilst out I came across my first piece of Oscar Niemeyer &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/home/sao-paulo-architecture&quot;&gt;architecture&lt;/a&gt;. The Niemeyer building. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure enough Savassi was lively, I saw two Greeks (the only two Greeks I saw) being interviewed on T.V. and their prediction of 2-0 to Greece had the place in uproar. (Thank goodness they didn&#39;t drink all the whisky). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decided to head back up the hill and get something to eat near home. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found a quiet place on the main road five minutes away. The owner spoke English and we had a long chat. He had just taken over two weeks ago and was going to have some local musicians playing. He asked me if that was O.K. I said it was perfect, we can watch the football and listen to the music. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The musicians were good, but the game was about to end, I didn&#39;t sleep on the plane so after 42 hours without sleep I said I would pay the bill and go home. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as I was about to leave he asked if I would join some of his friends as they had been asking him about me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How could I say no. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We went through the food menu and I tried a bit of everything, and they insisted I tried cachaça. Well I know it&#39;s made from sugar cane. (And in the words of Thurston Moore &quot;I love you sugar Kane&quot;) After discovering it in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/soccerphile/africa-nations/index.html&quot;&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;, it is my favourite soft drink. I  am already alert and looking for the cane sticks in the juice bars, and stop every time I see it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I had cachaça, it didn&#39;t taste the same. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suddenly the musicians started playing the Stevie Wonder riff from Superstition ( I didn&#39;t ask if it was because it was Friday 13th) this was completely out of sync as everything else they had played sounded traditional Brazilian. Lou, who I had been talking to got up and started singing. Wow! I had found my own Astrud Gilberto. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She carried on as they returned to Brazilian songs. Once she returned I found out she is a professional singer.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My new-found friends didn&#39;t want me to leave Belo Horizonte, but I explained that I would be back for my last night in two weeks time. Lou then insisted that I also come out the next night as it is her birthday! (Amanda if I don&#39;t make it back to work on time you know why.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I eventually went to bed about 2a.m. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Up at 8 and headed back to the bus station to put my bag in left luggage. Except it was full! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Walking towards the stadium I saw a two year old being driven in a small remote controlled car by her father.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ended up taking my bag to the game, all 8.7kg of it. Got it through security no problem. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iew2A7c_drE/U6EF20fyscI/AAAAAAAAf8E/2Ipmf-aK24k/s1600/photo+(1).JPG&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Belo Horizonte Stadium&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iew2A7c_drE/U6EF20fyscI/AAAAAAAAf8E/2Ipmf-aK24k/s1600/photo+(1).JPG&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; title=&quot;Belo Horizonte&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the match there was a large police presence and the main road in town was closed.

There  was a mixture of nationalities present with the majority being from England and Japan. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Croatia scored, people quickly realised the implications. Unhappy people in Brasil means a greater chance of strikes, and just now that would lead to chaos.  As is customary I normally let others board the plane first. I wasn&#39;t about to change that this evening. We had already had a final boarding call, but still people were watching the game. An announcement was made saying this was the last final call, and people reluctantly moved. When Neymar equalised the cheer from the handful left watching led to the boarding queue, returning to the screen. Fed up with this staff rounded everyone up and left the police to watch the game in peace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plane I was sat between Tomahiko, from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.japanvisitor.com/japan-city-guides/city-guide-ibaraki&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ibaraki&lt;/a&gt;, Japan and C.J. (you&#39;ll guess his second name) Bond from Harrow, England.  My initial greeting of &lt;i&gt;hajimemashite&lt;/i&gt;, shocked my new Japanese friend, he didn&#39;t expect that and he was even more surprised when I explained that I had been to his home town, not only for the World Cup but to see his team Kashima Antlers coached by Zico win the league some years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tomahiko is studying in Dublin for his football coaching badge, and would one day like to coach in Europe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He would be going to Japan&#39;s first game in &lt;a href=&quot;http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/06/recife.html&quot;&gt;Recife&lt;/a&gt; and watching two other games in the completion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my other side C.J. wasted no time in telling me he was supporting England as he has since 1990. It transpired that he has been busy over the last 4 years promoting &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldcupbuster.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;worldcupbuster.com&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EZ7424cG-7o/U5uqBIDIJKI/AAAAAAAAf6Q/r2hBKyxSe_M/s1600/png+buster.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Buster&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EZ7424cG-7o/U5uqBIDIJKI/AAAAAAAAf6Q/r2hBKyxSe_M/s1600/png+buster.png&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; title=&quot;Buster&quot; width=&quot;315&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A campaign to raise money for Cancer research, due to this I was prepared to listen (and now to help promote).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The central character Buster is an English pitbull terrier, who stars in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAjv-XGPRAI&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;You Tube video&lt;/a&gt; with lots of well known celebrities, (C.J. can be seen with Ian Wright towards the end.)  England haven&#39;t had a mascot for some time, and C.J.&#39;s dream is to have people recognise Buster and do the dance, (I take it by now you&#39;ve seen the video!) which is to the tune of Tom Hark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C.J. has used his connections and his ability to talk for England to make all this happen. With his dogged determination I am sure he will help raise a lot of money for a worthwhile charity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we went through customs, we were picked out.... as brothers! C. J hair slicked back, former dancer and me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I forgot to tell you was that C.J.&#39;s luggage consisted of a forty foot flag packed in a dog&#39;s head! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway we managed to get the dog&#39;s head through customs so no doubt you will see Buster in Brazil. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;© Ross Clegg &amp;amp; Soccerphile.com&lt;/b&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/feeds/1703323793191412955/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7424337262078805962&amp;postID=1703323793191412955' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/1703323793191412955'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/1703323793191412955'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/06/departure-for-brazil.html' title='Departure for Brazil'/><author><name>Soccerphile</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='6' src='http://bp3.blogger.com/_USzog_GOzyA/R-enhnyI37I/AAAAAAAADcs/gy7OPVaMJSY/S220/japan-visitor-logo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EZ7424cG-7o/U5uqBIDIJKI/AAAAAAAAf6Q/r2hBKyxSe_M/s72-c/png+buster.png" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7424337262078805962.post-1804227132541475933</id><published>2014-06-11T13:31:00.002+01:00</published><updated>2014-11-05T03:52:57.991Z</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2014 World Cup"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="architecture"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Brazil"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="image"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Japan"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Ross Clegg"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Travel"/><title type='text'>Introduction to the 2014 World Cup in Brazil</title><content type='html'>Well four years since the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/home/world-cup-2010&quot;&gt;last World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, so it is time to do it all again. Holding down a job so I can pay for all of this, means that I can make the first two weeks (or so) of the competition. (Who knows in 4 years time?). Obviously I would love to be able to go travelling for two months (like some I know…Mick…John), but I have to return to work and pay for the next trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LQgd3qRnemo/U5hL951hdDI/AAAAAAAAf5Q/ccGHN8TOeHc/s1600/ross-1.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Introduction to the 2014 World Cup in Brazil&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LQgd3qRnemo/U5hL951hdDI/AAAAAAAAf5Q/ccGHN8TOeHc/s1600/ross-1.jpg&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; title=&quot;Introduction to the 2014 World Cup in Brazil by Ross Clegg&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put out my intended itinerary some time ago and invited others to join me, but (would you believe) I am on my own again, it appears I am the only one taking on this particular schedule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;14th Belo Horizonte     &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/home/colombia-world-cup-2014-team-profile&quot;&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt; v Greece&lt;br /&gt;15th Brasilia                 Switzerland v Ecuador&lt;br /&gt;17th Fortaleza              Brazil v Mexico&lt;br /&gt;19th Natal                    Japan v Greece&lt;br /&gt;20th Recife                  Italy v Costa Rica&lt;br /&gt;22nd &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/home/rio-rising-rio-de-janeiro-guide&quot;&gt;Rio de Janeiro&lt;/a&gt;    Belgium v Russia&lt;br /&gt;23rd Sao Paulo            Netherlands v Chile&lt;br /&gt;25th Porto Alegre        Nigeria v &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/home/argentina-world-cup-2014-team-profile&quot;&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;26th Curitiba               Algeria v Russia &lt;br /&gt;28th Belo Horizonte   Winner A v Runner Up B&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again with the help of good (and trusting) friends I have managed to secure tickets for all 10 games that I planned to go to, despite all the obstacles FIFA try to put in the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say that I can&#39;t understand how they are allowed to (a) charge so much (b) allowed not to put &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/home/football-tickets&quot;&gt;tickets on sale&lt;/a&gt; for 10 games for a long period of time, but I think by now we all understand that while they exist they are a law unto themselves. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having been shocked at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/home/euro-2012&quot;&gt;Euro 2012&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2012/06/finding-accommodation-in-donetsk.html&quot;&gt;price of accommodation&lt;/a&gt; (especially in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/home/ukraine-travel-guide&quot;&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;), and the fact that everywhere I booked 6 months prior to the event cancelled on me and put up there prices, I was wary of booking anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, despite an increase in prices, the places I have booked have not cancelled or raised prices further. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The logistics of travelling from A to B in Brazil meant  a straight choice between getting a flight or catching the bus. I have opted (with one exception) for taking the bus. The benefits of this are that there is an established bus network in Brazil, the coaches are more comfortable than here in the UK, no waiting at airports.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Travelling mainly overnight, means there is no need to book as many nights in hotels. Also the flights I have booked the one to Brazil and the internal flight have already been altered a number of times, thankfully the new times still fit into my schedule. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Planning the trip to Brazil, meant reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0747561796/soccerphileco-21&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Futebol:                The Brazilian Way Of Life by Alex Bellos&lt;/a&gt; and spending  time trying to work my way round Brazilian websites, with my very limited Portuguese. From the websites it is already clear that my years of studying the English language at school will be of little or no use over in Brasil. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From previous trips to South America, I do not expect things to go to plan. I can still remember the strike in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/soccerphile/copa-america-2004/photos/&quot;&gt;Peru&lt;/a&gt; which grounded planes and the bus I was travelling in being pelted by stones, because there was a national transport strike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Venezuala, we had the tickets that didn&#39;t materialise, and in Argentina they used the volcano in Iceland as a reason for postponing one of their flights which led to a quick change in schedule, so who knows what awaits in Brazil. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During my travels I will be looking out for Oscar, no not Oscar dos Santos Emboaba Júnior who plays for Chelsea but Oscar Ribeiro de Almeida Niemeyer Soares Filho Known as Oscar Niemeyer.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the reasons for this is that a friend recently looked at some pictures I had taken at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/home/europa-league&quot;&gt;Europa League&lt;/a&gt; Final&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/footballtraveslwithross/sets/72157644277288189/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://www.flickr.com/photos/footballtraveslwithross/sets/72157644277288189/&lt;/a&gt;) and they complained that I obviously liked all the straight line architecture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well with Oscar&#39;s help, I will try and show a different side as he said &quot;I am not attracted to straight angles or to the straight line, hard and inflexible, created by man. I am attracted to free-flowing, sensual curves. The curves that I find in the mountains of my country, in the sinuousness of its rivers, in the waves of the ocean, and on the body of the beloved woman. Curves make up the entire Universe, the curved Universe of Einstein.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;© Ross Clegg &amp;amp; Soccerphile.com&lt;/b&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/feeds/1804227132541475933/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7424337262078805962&amp;postID=1804227132541475933' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/1804227132541475933'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/1804227132541475933'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/06/introduction-to-2014-world-cup-in-brazil.html' title='Introduction to the 2014 World Cup in Brazil'/><author><name>Soccerphile</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='6' src='http://bp3.blogger.com/_USzog_GOzyA/R-enhnyI37I/AAAAAAAADcs/gy7OPVaMJSY/S220/japan-visitor-logo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LQgd3qRnemo/U5hL951hdDI/AAAAAAAAf5Q/ccGHN8TOeHc/s72-c/ross-1.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7424337262078805962.post-3626442428316706792</id><published>2014-06-05T12:28:00.002+01:00</published><updated>2014-11-05T04:47:21.971Z</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2014 World Cup"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Brazil"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="England"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="England National Team"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="FIFA"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Fifa World Rankings"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="world rankings"/><title type='text'>Fifa World Rankings June 2014</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pYYDc0SabEw/UbByb2DLTDI/AAAAAAAAdn8/TonfgSojRhQ/s1600/fifa-rankings2.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;FIFA World Fifa Rankings&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pYYDc0SabEw/UbByb2DLTDI/AAAAAAAAdn8/TonfgSojRhQ/s200/fifa-rankings2.jpg&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; title=&quot;FIFA World Fifa Rankings&quot; width=&quot;177&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Fifa&#39;s World Rankings for June 2014 were published today at FIFA HQ in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/soccerphile/euro2008/city_guide/zurich.html&quot;&gt;Zurich&lt;/a&gt;, Switzerland.

and Scotland looking for some valuable experience ahead of their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/home/euro-2016&quot;&gt;Euro 2016 campaign&lt;/a&gt; in the autumn, as well as two boisterous ex-pat communities of London ready to party, there was always the prospect of a lively 90 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gordon Strachan&#39;s men looked the slicker of the two teams from the kick-off; Scotland were fielding a strong starting eleven while Nigeria coach Stephen Keshi was auditioning players for his final 23-man squad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it was the Scot with the Nigerian father, Ikechi Anya, who caught the eye early on. Flattened by Nigeria&#39;s Kunle Odunlami in under two minutes, the quick and clever Watford winger almost got his name on the scoresheet two minutes later by firing a shot onto the far post from an acute angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nigeria were slow out of the blocks and went behind after ten minutes from a set piece. Shaun Maloney and Anya combined to tee-up James Morrison from a left-wing corner and Charlie Mulgrew tipped his succeeding blast looping high into the corner of the net.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Scots were worth their lead. Their formation was solid and balanced, their passing sharper and terrestrial and in Steven Naismith they had a livewire striker. Nigeria had more height so were using more of an aerial approach, but a host of crosses lumped into the box and snatched attempts at finding killer balls had led to a disjointed final third of the field for the African champions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strikers Shola Ameobi &amp;amp; Uchebo were drifting around posing no obvious threat, yet against the run of play Nigeria drew level in the 41st minute. Uchebo received the ball in the middle and advanced without challenge to let rip, a deflection off the unlucky Grant Hanley wrongfooting McGregor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second half took little time to catch fire, as McGregor tipped away a close range Ameobi shot before Scotland regained the lead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Raiding right-back Alan Hutton was allowed too much space to sneak into the box and the Aston Villa man whipped a ball across the goalmouth which took a couple of deflections before billowing the onion bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nigeria&#39;s support cheered loudly when West Brom&#39;s Peter Odemwingie took the field in the 55th minute and after Chelsea&#39;s Victor Moses joined him up front six minutes later, the Super Eagles at last had some skilful footwork to add to their strong and direct approach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet still the Scots pressed. The Tartan Army cheered just after the hour mark as the ball was again in the Nigerian net but the almost identikit goal was disallowed for a foul. Scotland were denied a third again in the 67th when substitutes George Boyd and Chris Martin combined for Martin to pull the trigger, only to see his snapshot draw an equally reflexive save from Nigerian custodian Austine Ejide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As medleys of &#39;Flower of Scotland&#39; boomed out from the Hammersmith Road end, Strachan&#39;s men looked all set to register their fourth successive away win before Uche Nwofor capitalised on fatal defensive hesitation to lash in an equaliser in the final minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nigeria&lt;/b&gt;: Ejide, Yobo, Echiejile, Obi (Igiebor 53&#39;), Egwuekwe, Odunlami (Emuobo 75&#39;), Uzoenyi (Moses 61&#39;), Ameobi (Nwofor 62&#39;) Uchebo (Odemwingie 55&#39;), Gabriel, Babatunde (Oduamadi 66&#39;).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scotland&lt;/b&gt;: McGregor, Hutton, Robertson (Forsyth 77&#39;), Greer, Hanley, Morrison (Boyd 63&#39;), Mulgrew, Brown, Naismith (Martin 45&#39;), Maloney, Anya (Whittaker 84&#39;).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;(c) Sean O&#39;Conor &amp;amp; Soccerphile&lt;/i&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/feeds/8625628586700551969/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7424337262078805962&amp;postID=8625628586700551969' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/8625628586700551969'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/8625628586700551969'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/05/nigeria-share-goals-with-scots.html' title='Nigeria share goals with Scots'/><author><name>Sean O&#39;Conor</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='33' height='20' src='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_alcLfIha2wA/SfGD9nB7_6I/AAAAAAAAA9w/hefDCUsPw00/S220/puma.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><georss:featurename>Craven Cottage, Stevenage Road, London SW6 6HH, UK</georss:featurename><georss:point>51.474857099999987 -0.22152719999996862</georss:point><georss:box>51.472384599999984 -0.22656969999996862 51.47732959999999 -0.21648469999996861</georss:box></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7424337262078805962.post-7532032394917465486</id><published>2014-05-28T19:55:00.001+01:00</published><updated>2014-11-05T03:55:35.718Z</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Craven Cottage"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="international friendlies"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Nigeria"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="scotland"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Sean O&#39;Conor"/><title type='text'>International Friendly: Scotland v Nigeria</title><content type='html'>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Craven Cottage, London &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a month&#39;s rain in 48 hours, the heavens have mercifully held  off before &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/home/group-f-world-cup-2014#nigeria&quot;&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt; grapple with Scotland in their World Cup warm-up  match here in London.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stephen Keshi will be looking to audition several potential members of his final squad in the first of three friendlies before they tackle Argentina, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Iran in Brazil, while Gordon Strachan is planning his assault on Euro 2016 and Scotland&#39;s first qualifier, a tall test away to Germany this autumn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A contrast in styles should be useful preparation for Nigeria&#39;s Brazilian adventure, while Scotland manager Strachan is also hoping to benefit from the 90 minutes, explaining, &quot;A good team is a good team.&quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The supporters have wended their way along the river Thames through the tranquility of the historic Bishops Park.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outside on the Hammersmith Road, the hum of Nigerian drums and the roar of their trumpets mixed with the bagpipes and good-natured singing of the Tartan Army.

Images of the Uruguayan star being carried out of hospital in a wheelchair so close to the World Cup was painful viewing for soccer fans worldwide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Suarez and the Uruguayan F.A. are insisting he will be ready to play in Brazil, the fear is that even if he does, he will not be the almost unstoppable goalscorer he has been in the Premier League this season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even England, Italy and Costa Rica, who have been agonising about how to stop Suarez in the first round in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/home/group-d-world-cup-2014&quot;&gt;Group D&lt;/a&gt;, will feel his absence would diminish the competition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it is the World Cup, we want to see the world&#39;s hottest players there, and no striker is hotter right now than Suarez, whose 31 league goals for Liverpool bagged him both the PFA and Football Writers&#39; Player of the Season award.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/oRbv4i_kx3c&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colombia&#39;s &lt;i&gt;El Tigre&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;Radamel Falcao &lt;/b&gt;also risks missing the big show, having been out of action &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97oZb6AA05o&quot;&gt;since January&lt;/a&gt; after tearing knee ligaments playing for Monaco in a French cup tie. Last summer Falcao was Europe&#39;s most sought after striker and with nine goals in 13 qualifiers, he bears his World Cup hopes on his shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Falcao posted an &lt;a href=&quot;http://instagram.com/p/n8EOt6J--J/#&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Instagram of himself&lt;/a&gt; on the 13th of May, boasting of running 9.4km and swimming 1.5km as he battles to make the 2nd of June deadline for Jose Pekerman&#39;s 23-man squad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Los Cafeteros&lt;/i&gt; were given a send-off in Bogota on Friday night in front of 30,000 fans at El Campin stadium. Next they fly to Buenos Aires, where they take on Senegal on the 31st of May and Jordan on the 6th of June in friendly action before going to their base in Cotia on the outskirts of Sao Paolo. Falcao, for now, remains in Spain continuing to recuperate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the sake of the tournament, let us hope they both win their races against time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;

title=&quot;This is the year for Brazil&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No other country on earth is so mythically linked with football, so a &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/home/brazil&quot;&gt;World Cup in Brazil&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/b&gt;makes perfect sense. In fact, an outsider must wonder how such a huge soccer-obsessed country has not hosted the game&#39;s biggest show since 1950.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brazil is the &lt;b&gt;fifth-largest nation&lt;/b&gt; on earth and the sleepiest of sleeping giants, so much so that politicians have used the phrase &#39;the nation of the future&#39; with unthinking pride. So when will it all be ready?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should be. Now it is a &lt;b&gt;BRIC nation&lt;/b&gt;, one of the next generation of global powers alongside Russia, India and China and with almost 200 million people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And hosting this summer&#39;s World Cup and the &lt;b&gt;2016 Olympic Games&lt;/b&gt; is supposed to rubber-stamp Brazil as the country of the present and not the future, a bona-fide South American super-nation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the eyes of the world everything was always rosy: The colour of the Rio Carnival, the samba and the bikini-clad girls on Ipanema and Copacabana, the happy children playing football on the beach, a nation personified by Carmen Miranda with the fruit on her head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet 2013&#39;s &#39;summer of hate&#39; sent a different image of Brazil around the world as &lt;b&gt;thousands protested&lt;/b&gt; and riots turned nasty. Expensive bus fares was the catalyst but the nation&#39;s spending priorities and the &#39;waste&#39; of the World Cup became the focus. Pele has waded in ineptly, first criticising, then siding with and then just lamenting the protests.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Brazil&quot;, intoned FIFA President &lt;b&gt;Sepp Blatter&lt;/b&gt; at the start of this year, &quot;has started work much too late. No country has been so far behind in its preparations since I have been at FIFA.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;&lt;b&gt;We are not ready&lt;/b&gt;&quot; was the less than feel-good message from General Secretary &lt;b&gt;Jerome Valcke&lt;/b&gt; in April this year, referring to World Cup preparations. A month later he added, ominously, &quot;We have been through hell.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The International Olympic Committee added salt to the wound by calling Brazil &quot;the worst prepared&quot; Olympic host it had ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Waving the white flag at FIFA so early on is an attempt to pre-empt criticism before the big kick-off on the &lt;b&gt;12th of June&lt;/b&gt;, but the proof is in the pudding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dominant narrative in global news has largely been of a country on the up: Brazil is projected to become the world’s &lt;b&gt;fourth-largest economy by 2050&lt;/b&gt;, with only China, the USA and India ahead of it, while their government eyes a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The evidence of economic prowess is clear: Brazilian oil giant Petrobras is the fourth-largest non-financial company on Earth while Brazil is the fifth largest agricultural producer, No.3 for fruit and meat and No.1 for coffee and sugar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When vast new oilfields were found in 2007 the nation&#39;s stock exchange boomed, and the country moved onto France&#39;s shoulder as the sixth-largest world economy. As a vote of confidence in its future, China overtook the USA as Brazil’s major overseas investor in 2009. Salaries have risen and millions have been lifted out of poverty thanks to&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;bolsas familias&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;(family allowances).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet the country&#39;s dark side is also hard to ignore. &lt;b&gt;Crime &lt;/b&gt;is a constant issue for the locals, let alone for tourists, so a heavy police presence will greet the half a million visitors expected this summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recent films like Bus 174 and City of God have brought the favelas, the jaw-dropping shanty-towns dotting Brazil&#39;s sprawling metropolises, to the world. A quick peek on GoogleEarth and the social apartheid of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/home/rio-rising&quot;&gt;Rio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/home/sao-paulo-architecture&quot;&gt;Sao Paulo&lt;/a&gt; is laid bare. This is a country which still has a long way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Behind the glowing statistics lies a nation handicapped by extremes of wealth and poverty. The World Bank states that the richest 20% of Brazil owns 33 times as much as the lowest 20%, placing the country in the &lt;b&gt;top ten of unequal nations&lt;/b&gt; on earth. Less than 3% of the people own two-thirds of the land and while the top 10% take almost half the nation’s income, the bottom 10% are illiterate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In GDP per capita, Brazil actually trails the rest of South America. The Economist rates it as low as 37th for business competitiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This inequality has led to swathes of gated communities, helicopters and a burgeoning security industry: Brazilians are afraid of each other, and with double the murder rate of the USA, can you blame them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Governments sell Olympics and World Cups to their doubters with the carrot of glistening new infrastructure, but in Brazil&#39;s case the promised new airports, roads and rail links have not arrived. At the same time, the cost of the as yet unfinished stadia has jumped to a staggering three times that of South Africa in 2010.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By last year, it was clear frustration was about to spill over, and it did, across the nation. 60,000 people demonstrated in Belo Horizonte alone, one of this summer&#39;s host cities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who needs expensive new sports arenas when the people do not have proper schools or hospitals, ran the incontestable logic of the movement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;President &lt;b&gt;Dilma Roussef &lt;/b&gt;has struggled to maintain authority as a doubling of income per capita and the lifting of 20 million out of poverty over the last decade have led to spiralling expectations for faster change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The anger is somewhat middle-class driven. The lives of the rich elite have remained cocooned while some of the poor have seen their lives bettered. But the rest of the population is demanding to know why they are paying European levels of tax without concomitant European standards of living.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A month of football will make everyone happy, especially if the home team lift the cup, but Brazilians are itching for real progress, not temporary parties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The government and FIFA are expecting more unrest this summer, but praying the nation&#39;s love of football will stop it from disrupting the nation’s big night on the world stage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On paper Brazil should already be a superpower: &lt;b&gt;200 million citizens&lt;/b&gt;, a quarter of the world&#39;s arable land, plentiful oil and biofuels, and no enemies to threaten it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But a ragged history of colonialism, slavery and military dictatorships have held back this sleeping giant for decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Independent from Portugal since &lt;b&gt;1889&lt;/b&gt;, Brazil went backwards in the second half of the twentieth century following a military &lt;b&gt;coup d&#39;état in 1964&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rapid growth soon led to economic ruin, censorship, torture, political murders and rampant inequality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Democracy returned in &lt;b&gt;1990&lt;/b&gt;, which makes Brazil a young nation at heart. 2014 does offer Brazil a unique chance to promote itself, as the last World Cup Final was watched by an estimated 700 million people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it needs more tourist dollars. For all its attractiveness, Brazil barely ranks in the top 50 most-visited countries on earth, attracting almost half the amount of overseas tourists who visit Morocco, for instance. Crime if often cited as the explanation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet if anything can take Brazilians&#39; minds off their problems it is football. While other countries have wars, artists, Nobel Prizes and scientific inventions to celebrate, Brazil can point to its &lt;b&gt;five World Cups&lt;/b&gt; as its greatest achievements. Football has allowed a nation with weaknesses to dream it is beating all others with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The adjective Brazilian has also become synonymous in football with flair and breathtaking skill, a world away from the muscular northern European sport Englishman &lt;b&gt;Charles Miller&lt;/b&gt; brought to Sao Paolo, like a missionary, in 1894. It feels like Brazilians play football to an instinctive samba rhythm and the phrase sexy football could have been coined for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Football is such a potent uniter of a divided nation, a social equaliser bar none, that although there will be protests again in June, they won’t be happening while the green and gold of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;seleçao&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;are playing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The game&#39;s potential for manipulation has not been lost on politicians, who have tried to ally themselves to the nation&#39;s favourite pastime for years. President Roussef is only the latest leader to schedule the general election in a World Cup year. If Brazil wins, she will surely reap some benefit in November.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Home advantage and a soccer-mad population means Brazil are the clear favourite for the World Cup, so elimination is unthinkable. But at the back of everyone&#39;s mind lurks the&lt;b&gt; trauma of 1950&lt;/b&gt;, the last time Brazil hosted the World Cup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the 16th of July 64 years ago, 174,000 packed Rio&#39;s Maracana stadium and millions more listened on the airwaves expecting Brazil to overwhelm Uruguay in the World Cup Final.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brazil took the lead but Uruguay equalised and then won thanks to a late goal from Alcides Ghiggia, a name which still unnerves Brazilians to this day. A nation was distraught and some fans even committed suicide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The so-called &lt;b&gt;Maracanazo &lt;/b&gt;(Maracana disaster) has obsessed Brazilians ever since. Nelson Rodrigues, the great Brazilian writer, called it &quot;our Hiroshima.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other writers concur on its significance beyond football: Joao Maximo believed it split Brazilian history into two, Paulo Perdigao likened the footage of Uruguay&#39;s second goal to the Kennedy assassination, while novelist Carlos Heitor Cony thought a monument to defeat should have been built, because nothing had ever united the nation more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brazil went on to win five World Cups and their 1970 team is feted as the greatest of all time, yet the nation is still haunted by having lost at home 64 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2014 affords the world&#39;s most famous football nation a chance to atone at last, yet the historical baggage of another final at the Maracana will be an emotional burden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the tears of joy dry up and the catharsis of exorcising 1950 is over, Brazilians can get back to tackling their nation&#39;s myriad problems, but first they must win &#39;their&#39; World Cup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;(c) Sean O&#39;Conor &amp;amp; Soccerphile&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/feeds/2140692696547052982/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7424337262078805962&amp;postID=2140692696547052982' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/2140692696547052982'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/2140692696547052982'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/05/this-is-year-for-brazil.html' title='This is the year for Brazil'/><author><name>Sean O&#39;Conor</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='33' height='20' src='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_alcLfIha2wA/SfGD9nB7_6I/AAAAAAAAA9w/hefDCUsPw00/S220/puma.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AWJJzoea3wU/U3zJDSA706I/AAAAAAAAfy4/Xu6-2Fa0slM/s72-c/rio-guide-4.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7424337262078805962.post-114975990915620780</id><published>2014-05-21T03:23:00.003+01:00</published><updated>2014-11-05T04:48:18.535Z</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2014 World Cup"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Africa Nations Cup"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="African football"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Brazil"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="FIFA World Cup"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Jon Obi Mikel"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Nigeria"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="scotland"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Sean O&#39;Conor"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Stephen Keshi"/><title type='text'>Super Eagles are ready for take-off</title><content type='html'>&lt;h3&gt;No one is tipping Nigeria, but confidence and a favourable draw could carry them far in Brazil&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PWI9z9T_tBw/U3zNot5_VyI/AAAAAAAAfzA/blRm0Ero1Pw/s1600/NGA_1.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Nigeria Super Eagles&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PWI9z9T_tBw/U3zNot5_VyI/AAAAAAAAfzA/blRm0Ero1Pw/s1600/NGA_1.png&quot; title=&quot;Super Eagles&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Of the less-fancied teams travelling to the &lt;b&gt;World Cup Finals&lt;/b&gt; next month, it might be worth keeping an eye on &lt;b&gt;Nigeria&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The &lt;b&gt;Super Eagles&lt;/b&gt; warm up next week for their Brazilian adventure with a friendly against Scotland at Fulham&#39;s Craven Cottage.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stephen Keshi&lt;/b&gt;&#39;s team head to the World Cup Finals unbeaten in qualifiers and ranked 44&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; in the world, without heavy expectation on their shoulders.

Not only do Nigeria arrive confident after winning the African Cup of Nations last year for the first time since 1994, but they also find themselves in the easier half of the draw, avoiding Brazil, Spain, Colombia, Uruguay, England, Italy and the Netherlands until the semi-finals.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;It will be big ask to top a group containing &lt;b&gt;Argentina&lt;/b&gt;, but with &lt;b&gt;Iran &lt;/b&gt;and &lt;b&gt;Bosnia-Herzegovina&lt;/b&gt; the other first-round opponents, Nigeria will feel they have a real chance of finishing in the top two positions in &lt;b&gt;Group F.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Round of 16 opponents would then come from the less than terrifying Group E of Switzerland, France, Ecuador and Honduras, which should give Nigeria genuine hope of reaching the last eight for the first time in their history.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;They will be mindful of course of their two second-round odysseys which ended with conflicting fortunes: In 1994 they were two minutes from eliminating Roberto Baggio&#39;s Italy, who ended up losing the final on penalties, but went down 2-1, and at France &#39;98 they collapsed surprisingly easily 4-1 to Denmark.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Keshi is cut from the traditional disciplinarian cloth of Nigerian head coaches, but remains popular with his players after the Nations Cup win and loved domestically for his blooding of Nigeria- based players: Despite Nigerian footballers being scattered to the four winds, five of the preliminary squad for Brazil play their trade at home and over 30 have been called up over the past year. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&#39;Big Boss&#39; Keshi &amp;nbsp;&amp;amp; his assistant &lt;b&gt;Daniel Amokachi &lt;/b&gt;are also fondly remembered as skipper and striker for Nigeria at USA &#39;94, their country&#39;s historic first World Cup Finals appearance.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Softly-spoken goalkeeper and captain &lt;b&gt;Vincent Enyeama&lt;/b&gt; speaks highly of his manager. &quot;He is a great guy,&quot; he told FIFA.com, &quot;a man-manager who tries to build a team on unity.&quot; Chelsea’s &lt;b&gt;Jon-Obi Mikel&lt;/b&gt; added, &quot;He always wants you to work 110% every day in training and in games…and I think every player is enjoying the challenge.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Mikel is the best known Nigerian player worldwide after eight successful seasons with Chelsea, but has yet to feature in a World Cup Finals. The pivot of the side&#39;s attack-minded 4-4-1-1 formation, Mikel&#39;s job is to orchestrate the attacks using his pacy wingmen &lt;b&gt;Victor Moses&lt;/b&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;Ahmed Musa&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Behind Mikel just to his right, Lazio’s young anchorman Ogenyi Oyazi has impressed recently and additional speed can be injected into the attack from Brescia’s Nnamdi Oduamadi and Heerenveen&#39;s Uche Nwofor. Expect vertical play from Nigeria instead of possession football or a slow build-up.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Kesha has to choose between Chievo&#39;s &lt;b&gt;Victor Obinna&lt;/b&gt; or Fenerbahce&#39;s &lt;b&gt;Emanuel Emanike&lt;/b&gt; as the main marksman. Another option could be Stoke’s Peter Odemwingie or Newcastle veteran Shola Ameobi, and the team can adjust to 4-2-3-1 or 4-3-3&amp;nbsp; when required to accommodate more than one striker.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;At the back is where Nigeria will sink or swim. It is hard to glean much from their African qualifiers against Malawi, Kenya, Namibia and Ethiopia, so the friendly clashes with Scotland and after that Greece and the USA before flying to Brazil will be illuminating.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;When Nigeria last met decent overseas opposition, competitively in last summer&#39;s &lt;b&gt;Confederations Cup&lt;/b&gt;, they lost to Spain and Uruguay.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The expected centre-back pairing of Middlesbrough&#39;s Kenneth Omeruo and Caykur Rizespor&#39;s Godfrey Oboabona have a combined age of only 44, though Keshi may be tempted to field 24 year-old Azubuike Egwuekwe, who plies his trade in Nigeria with Warri Wolves and has 31 caps.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Keshi&#39;s team will play on the front foot in Brazil and should entertain the neutrals with fast and attacking football.

If Scudamore has truly repented having seen the error of his ways, and henceforth fights the corner of women in sport then that would surely be a triumph, of sorts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;The apology I have made is sincere,&quot; pleaded Scudamore, &quot;as is the contrition I feel...It is something that will never be repeated.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, the language he used was particularly shocking to many people for whom only his head on a platter will do. It is hard to see the England goalkeeper Rachel Brown for instance, shaking Scudamore&#39;s hand after she branded his emails &quot;an insult to women&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with the Press Complaints Commission&#39;s historic failure to regulate the excesses of Fleet Street, it seems clear leaving Scudamore&#39;s fate to the Premier League clubs he works with on a daily basis is an inadequate reflex compared to employing an external and objective board of enquiry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was 17 club chairmen (including two women - Margaret Byrne of Sunderland and Karren Brady of West Ham) who rubber-stamped his exoneration on the basis that the sum total of all his correspondence did not find evidence of &quot;wider discriminatory attitudes, inappropriate language or a general attitude of disrespect to women.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brady said Scudamore was &quot;categorically not sexist,&quot; the same Karren Brady who got into football via her advertising sales work for pornographer David Sullivan. Margaret Byrne meanwhile brushed off all the furore by saying she was &quot;delighted common sense had prevailed.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if English football does contain a bedrock of sexism, self-regulation is probably not the way forward in such a male-dominated sport. It would be a surprise if football, with its focus on male athletes and the masculine culture of the dressing-room had less sexism than industries employing a 50-50 balance of men and women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its male dominance also explains why there have been no openly gay footballers in English football, while openly lesbian players work in the women&#39;s game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my experience as a journalist in English football, I cannot say I have witnessed open sexism or other popular forms of discrimination in any dealings with clubs or governing bodies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yet there is a residual oddness about being in a workplace in which the only women one sees are office staff, cheerleaders and the occasional journalist, but never centre stage as protagonists on the field or in the dugouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Visit the Premier League headquarters in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.britain-visitor.com/london&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s elegant Marylebone district and you are struck by the number of women employed in its offices. No wonder then that Scudamore&#39;s dinosaur language was flagged up once noticed, but how many other men in football think the same and have done so, unrepentant, for years because they have never been caught?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some clubs are better than others at employing female press officers, who do just as good a job if not better than their male colleagues, yet press rooms are overwhelmingly male and dressing rooms completely so, which made me realise I was working amid one of the last bastions of male domination. Despite being a lifelong football fanatic, being on the inside still felt odd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The female journalists and press officers I encountered were often more interesting as people than their male counterparts, probably because they had ploughed a more arduous and unfamiliar furrow in getting to where they were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the few occasions I socialised with professional footballers, I was struck by how many young women threw themselves at them, doubtless entranced by knowledge of their telephone-number salaries and possible brushes with fame. This inevitably created an unbalanced relationship between the sexes, where women happily deferred to often less intelligent men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus, football&#39;s gender bias is an intrinsic absurdity. Because all the players and most of the supporters are male, men unthinkingly relate more easily to male commentators and administrators as a result and a locker-room mentality emerges too easily, a safe haven for jokes about those out of sight and mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this is still 2014, wider society has moved on and soccer is not hermetically sealed from it, like it or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No-one is suggesting men&#39;s and women&#39;s football should merge into a co-ed sport of mixed teams, but certainly there could be more efforts to bring women into football at all levels, even if the ladies are not about to take the field alongside the lads. In every other football job, women are as capable as men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.womeninfootball.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Women in Football&lt;/a&gt; (WiF) is one group trying to redress the balance by promoting equal participation in all facets of the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its board members include BBC commentator Jacqui Oatley, sports lawyer Jean Bevan and Chief Executive of the Sports Grounds Safety Authority Ruth Shaw, as well as Vicki Orvice, who writes for Rupert Murdoch&#39;s tabloid The Sun, which is hardly a paragon of sexual equality with its daily bare breasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WiF called Scudamore&#39;s words &quot;offensive&quot; and added, &quot;the comments have yet again proved we are a long way from equality.&quot; According to their own survey of 1,000 women in the game, over two-thirds have witnessed sexual discrimination in their workplaces, a damning statistic for any industry in 2014.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it stands, the dinosaurs have won the day, but the war is far from over. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thefa.com/news/governance/equality/2013/dec/fa-inclusion-advisory-board-membership-confirmed&quot;&gt;F.A.&#39;s Inclusion Advisory Board&lt;/a&gt;, which features former England left-back Graeme Le Saux,&amp;nbsp;will be watching like a hawk. Its chair Helen Rabbatts, who spoke of a &quot;closed culture of sexism&quot; at the Premier League, will we are told be working more closely with the organisation to promote its equal opportunities agenda. Suffice to say, any sexist will think twice now about emailing any &#39;jokes&#39; to his mates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rani Abraham&lt;/b&gt;, the woman who first leaked the emails, called the Premier League&#39;s decision to take no further action against their boss &quot;a whitewash&quot; which &quot;sends out a very damaging message as to how women are regarded in football.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That the Premier League is considering suing her for accessing Scudamore&#39;s emails in the first place seems perverse, not least because she insists it was within her job description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ms. Abraham should rather be congratulated for shining a light into one of football&#39;s most primitive corners, an uncomfortable truth which must be confronted and which for those on the receiving end is no laughing matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;(c) Sean O&#39;Conor &amp;amp; Soccerphile&lt;/i&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/feeds/156651450416541314/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7424337262078805962&amp;postID=156651450416541314' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/156651450416541314'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/156651450416541314'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/05/scudamore-keeps-his-job-but-we-are-not.html' title='Scudamore keeps his job but we are not amused'/><author><name>Sean O&#39;Conor</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='33' height='20' src='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_alcLfIha2wA/SfGD9nB7_6I/AAAAAAAAA9w/hefDCUsPw00/S220/puma.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-a3QPkK_ELk4/U3zOahnnaSI/AAAAAAAAfzI/O_oBhvSA5HE/s72-c/Richard_Scudamore.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7424337262078805962.post-7153334927042182227</id><published>2014-05-20T16:31:00.001+01:00</published><updated>2014-11-05T04:48:51.671Z</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Al-Wakrah"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Eric Cantona"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="FIFA 2022 Qatar"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="FIFA Executive Committee"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Michel Platini"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Qatar"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Sean O&#39;Conor"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="World Cup stadia"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Zaha Hadid"/><title type='text'>Cantona aims kick at Platini</title><content type='html'>&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Manchester United legend &lt;b&gt;Eric Cantona&lt;/b&gt; has criticised UEFA President &lt;b&gt;Michel Platini&lt;/b&gt; for his role in choosing &lt;b&gt;Qatar &lt;/b&gt;as &lt;b&gt;2022 World Cup&lt;/b&gt; host.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Cantona, who played under Platini for France in the early 1990s, told &lt;i&gt;Le Parisien&lt;/i&gt; newspaper in Paris that the blame for handing the World Cup to a nation with extreme summer temperatures should not lie with FIFA President Sepp Blatter.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&quot;It was an idea of Platini,&quot; said Cantona. &quot;It was also Platini who gave the European U21 Championship to Israel, which is also disrepectful on the level of human rights.

Even the FIFA President is saying that handing the World Cup to Qatar for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/home/world-cup-2022&quot;&gt;2022&lt;/a&gt; was an error.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Of course, it was a mistake, &quot; Sepp Blatter told Swiss radio station RTS, adding wistfully, &quot;You know, one makes a lot of mistakes in life.&quot; Well, you said it, Sepp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What has been obvious to everyone since the vote in 2010 is that this was an extraordinary risk at best, a glaring error at worst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The elephant in the room, Qatar&#39;s boiling summer temperatures, was cited in FIFA&#39;s Technical Report but casually ignored by the 14 Executive Committee members who chose it ahead of the eight who voted for the USA in the last round of voting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The same report incidentally rated England as the premier choice for 2018, yet that same nation was eliminated in the first round of voting. Clearly FIFA does not listen to its own experts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Promises of stadium-scale air-conditioning may well be fulfilled, but as Ex.Co. member Chuck Blazer noted at the time, &quot;you can&#39;t air-condition a whole country&quot;. Plus the idea of hordes of beer-swilling fans filling the normally conservative Islamic country should have raised an eyebrow or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Subsequent revelations of the Jack Warner leveraged bribery of voters and the use of slave labour in stadium construction has made Qatar 2022 a PR disaster. UEFA boss &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/soccerphile/news/michel-platini.html&quot;&gt;Michel Platini&lt;/a&gt; has not helped either by suggesting the tournament be extended to other Arab nations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a Winter World Cup the only realistic solution unless the Gulf State is stripped of the hosting, the shake-up to domestic leagues could leave serious repercussions in the perennial club v country struggle. US Soccer meanwhile has thus far remained silent despite it having a cast-iron case for a voting re-run if as expected, the winter switch is ratified next year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIFA sure has a knack for choosing troublesome hosts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;General Secretary Jerome Valcke has just confessed they have &quot;been through hell&quot; with Brazil in 2014.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if they are thinking of relaxing in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/home/world-cup-2018&quot;&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;, the FIFA World Cup bandwagon travels to Vladimir Putin&#39;s Russia, of all places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sean O&#39;Conor&lt;/i&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/feeds/3402433932023731996/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7424337262078805962&amp;postID=3402433932023731996' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/3402433932023731996'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/3402433932023731996'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/05/sepp-comes-clean-on-qatar.html' title='Sepp comes clean on Qatar'/><author><name>Sean O&#39;Conor</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='33' height='20' src='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_alcLfIha2wA/SfGD9nB7_6I/AAAAAAAAA9w/hefDCUsPw00/S220/puma.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-99jNWPxgKGM/U3Y29Vg-B7I/AAAAAAAAfwU/QejAVEsdA6Y/s72-c/young-qatari-fan.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7424337262078805962.post-1095681750510842922</id><published>2014-05-15T00:39:00.000+01:00</published><updated>2014-11-05T04:49:11.968Z</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2014 World Cup"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Spain"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Thiago Alcantara"/><title type='text'>Thiago blow for Spain</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;

England squad &lt;/strong&gt;for the&lt;strong&gt; World Cup &lt;/strong&gt;finals released today held no great surprises, with the expected emphasis on youth comfirmed by the inclusion of Arsenal&#39;s &lt;b&gt;Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain&lt;/b&gt;, Everton&#39;s &lt;b&gt;Ross Barkley&lt;/b&gt;, Liverpool&#39;s &lt;b&gt;Jordan Henderson &lt;/b&gt;and&lt;b&gt;

and &lt;b&gt;James Milner&lt;/b&gt; retain their places, two of six veterans of England&#39;s ill-fated 2010 World Cup campaign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Goalkeepers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;: Joe Hart, Ben Foster, Frazer Forster&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Defenders&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;: Glen Johnson, Leighton Baines, Luke Shaw, Gary Cahill, Phil Jagielka, Chris Smalling, Phil Jones&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Midfielders&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;: Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard, Jack Wilshere, Jordan Henderson, Raheem Sterling, Adam Lallana, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, James Milner, Ross Barkley&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Attackers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;: Wayne Rooney, Danny Welbeck, Daniel Sturridge, Ricky Lambert&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile across the Atlantic, &lt;b&gt;Jurgen Klinsmann&lt;/b&gt; announced an initial 30-man squad for the &lt;b&gt;USA&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Goalkeepers:&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;Tim Howard, Brad Guzan, Nick Rimando&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Defenders:&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;DaMarcus Beasley, John Brooks, Matt Besler, Jeff Cameron, Timmy Chandler, Brad Evans, Omar Gonzalez, Clarence Goodson, Fabian Johnson, Michael Parkhurst, DeAndre Yedlin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Midfielders: &lt;/b&gt;Kyle Beckerman, Alejandro Bedoya, Michael Bradley, Joe Corona, Brad Davis, Mix Diskerud, Maurice Edu, Julian Green, Jermaine Jones, Graham Zusi&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Attackers: &lt;/b&gt;Jozy Altidore, Terrence Boyd, Clint Dempsey, Landon Donovan, Aron Johannsson, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/home/chris-wondolowski&quot;&gt;Chris Wondolowski&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Half the squad are from &lt;b&gt;Major League Soccer&lt;/b&gt;, four play in Germany, four in England, two in Mexico, and one in each of Austria, France, Netherlands, Norway and Turkey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they make the final cut, &lt;b&gt;DaMarcus Beasley&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Landon Donovan&lt;/b&gt; will travel to their fourth World Cup finals. Nine of the 30 were picked by Bob Bradley for the 2010 competition in South Africa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most notable absentee is DC United striker &lt;b&gt;Eddie Johnson&lt;/b&gt;, who has 63 caps for the US and scored four for them in qualifying. Stoke City winger&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;Brek Shea&lt;/b&gt;, tipped a while ago as a future star, was also ignored, as were several other England-based players: Bolton pair Tim Ream and Stuart Holden, Nottingham Forest&#39;s Eric Lichaj and the Birmingham City pair of Jonathan Spector and Will Packwood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The remaining teams have until the 13th of May to send their 30-man squads to FIFA, who will publish them formally on the 16th. The final deadline for the 23-man list is the second of June, with official publication on the fifth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;(c) Sean O&#39;Conor &amp;amp; Soccerphile&lt;/i&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/feeds/4336599004230143491/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7424337262078805962&amp;postID=4336599004230143491' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/4336599004230143491'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/4336599004230143491'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/05/world-cup-squad-announcements.html' title='World Cup squad announcements'/><author><name>Sean O&#39;Conor</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='33' height='20' src='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_alcLfIha2wA/SfGD9nB7_6I/AAAAAAAAA9w/hefDCUsPw00/S220/puma.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-98BqzTq2iIA/VH3Y94d8l9I/AAAAAAAAiKU/NpD8rEUD_Ik/s72-c/socc_logo.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7424337262078805962.post-6982114786647481515</id><published>2014-05-12T01:18:00.002+01:00</published><updated>2014-12-02T17:37:43.910Z</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2014 World Cup"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="England National Team"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Sean O&#39;Conor"/><title type='text'>Now if my name were Roy...</title><content type='html'>&lt;h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-98BqzTq2iIA/VH3Y94d8l9I/AAAAAAAAiKY/Fq-dvh7MXOo/s1600/socc_logo.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;If my name was Roy.&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-98BqzTq2iIA/VH3Y94d8l9I/AAAAAAAAiKY/Fq-dvh7MXOo/s1600/socc_logo.jpg&quot; title=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Thoughts on the eve of England&#39;s 2014 World Cup squad announcement&lt;/h3&gt;It is always fun for fans to second-guess their national team coach&#39;s World Cup squad. And so it is galling when the manager picks players you had cast off the list long ago, revealing his mind works on a different wavelength to the supporters&#39;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fabio Capello surprised many an England watcher four years ago by leaving Theo Walcott at home and plumping for experience in the shape of thirtyish-somethings &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/soccerphile/premier-league/gareth-barry.html&quot;&gt;Gareth Barry&lt;/a&gt;, Jamie Carragher, Emile Heskey, Ledley King and Matthew Upson, none of whom looked match-sharp in South Africa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had Capello had his way, Paul Scholes and David Beckham would have also made the team. Despite the outrage of Frank Lampard&#39;s disallowed goal in Bloemfontein, England were ruthlessly dispatched by a fitter and faster Germany.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roy Hodgson should do the opposite tomorrow and plump for untried and untested youth, as an antidote to Capello&#39;s failed experiment and the quarter-final roadblock England have met for the past few tournaments.&lt;br /&gt;Football memories are short, but most people were calling for a sudden end to England&#39;s so-called &#39;golden generation&#39; in the aftermath of South Africa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hodgson has dropped only a few hints, but his desire for fresh legs in the heat of Brazil seems clear. He will have been buffeted by the loss of Andros Townsend, Theo Walcott and Kyle Walker, but England right now is oddly blessed with a crop of fleet-footed youngsters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As at Euro 2012, expectations are low and with Italy and Uruguay in the first phase to hurdle, many are convinced the squad selection demands a throw of the dice since the old faces have failed time and again. The dilemma of course is that England are between generations and the incoming youngsters lack experience so much that no obvious spine has emerged of the team that should be aiming to challenge at Euro 2016.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another failure of the established stars and Hodgson will be pilloried for not being brave enough. Should the kids fail in Brazil however, the manager will still be credited for having looked to the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Predictions are never a doddle, so for what it is worth, this is the 23 whom I would pick tomorrow with a bias towards youth firmly in mind and veterans only included for want of fit alternatives:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Goalkeepers&lt;/b&gt;: Joe Hart, Frazer Forster, John Ruddy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Defenders&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/soccerphile/premier-league/glen-johnson.html&quot;&gt;Glen Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, Jon Flanagan, Leighton Baines, Luke Shaw, Phil Jagielka, Gary Cahill, Chris Smalling, Phil Jones&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Midfielders&lt;/b&gt;: Steven Gerrard, Jordan Henderson, Jack Wilshere, Tom Cleverley, Ross Barkley, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Adam Lallana&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Forwards:&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;Raheem Sterling, Wayne Rooney, Danny Welbeck, Daniel Sturridge, Ricky Lambert&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;(c) Sean O&#39;Conor &amp;amp; Soccerphile&lt;/i&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/feeds/6982114786647481515/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7424337262078805962&amp;postID=6982114786647481515' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/6982114786647481515'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/6982114786647481515'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/05/now-if-my-name-were-roy.html' title='Now if my name were Roy...'/><author><name>Sean O&#39;Conor</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='33' height='20' src='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_alcLfIha2wA/SfGD9nB7_6I/AAAAAAAAA9w/hefDCUsPw00/S220/puma.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-98BqzTq2iIA/VH3Y94d8l9I/AAAAAAAAiKY/Fq-dvh7MXOo/s72-c/socc_logo.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7424337262078805962.post-4997724465756054567</id><published>2014-05-09T13:20:00.000+01:00</published><updated>2014-11-05T04:57:51.683Z</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Betting"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="English Premier League"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="football betting"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Manchester City"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="prediction"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Predictions"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Sports Betting"/><title type='text'>George&#39;s Premiership Predictions May 11 2014</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href=&quot;http://imstore.bet365affiliates.com/Tracker.aspx?AffiliateId=3771&amp;amp;AffiliateCode=365_027632&amp;amp;CID=358&amp;amp;PID=149&amp;amp;TID=3&amp;amp;LNG=1&amp;amp;DID=27&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;bet365&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://imstore.bet365affiliates.com/?AffiliateCode=365_027632&amp;amp;CID=358&amp;amp;PID=149&amp;amp;LNG=1&amp;amp;TID=3&amp;amp;DID=27&quot; title=&quot;bet365&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;So here we are - the last weekend of the Premiership with Manchester City just needing to avoid defeat at the Etihad to lift their second title in recent years. Liverpool face Newcastle at Anfield hoping City slip up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We think it unlikely and this weekend will see the title move east across the city from Old Trafford to their Blue rivals. Cardiff and Fulham are already relegated and Norwich, home to Arsenal look odds-on to join them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunday 11 May 2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cardiff 0 v Chelsea 1 &lt;br /&gt;Fulham 1 v Crystal Palace 1 &lt;br /&gt;Hull 3 v Everton 2 &lt;br /&gt;Liverpool 2 v Newcastle 1 &lt;br /&gt;Man City 3 v West Ham 1 &lt;br /&gt;Norwich 0 v Arsenal 1 &lt;br /&gt;Southampton 2 v Man Utd 1 &lt;br /&gt;Sunderland 1 v Swansea 0 &lt;br /&gt;Tottenham 1 v Aston Villa 1 &lt;br /&gt;West Brom 2 v Stoke 2&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Relegated Trio 25/1 For An Instant Return To Premier League&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Canaries are all but relegated to the Championship after Sunderland&#39;s result on Wednesday night and bet365 are betting on how many of the trio of Cardiff, Fulham and Norwich make an instant return to the Premier League.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2014/15 Championship  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Number Of Cardiff/Fulham/Norwich To Be Promoted &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None 7/4 One Evs &lt;br /&gt;Two 7/2 Three 25/1  (Stakes returned if Norwich avoid 2013/14 relegation!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soccer - Cattermole aims for brighter future&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lee Cattermole hopes Sunderland can learn from this season&#39;s mistakes and enjoy a much better 2014-15 campaign. The Black Cats were seven points adrift of safety with just six games to go, but have confirmed their place in next season&#39;s top-flight by taking 13 points from their last five matches. After drawing 2-2 at Manchester City, they beat Chelsea, Cardiff City and Manchester United, before sealing their spot in the 2014-15 Premier League by cruising to a 2-0 victory against West Brom. Former Middlesbrough midfielder Cattermole said: &quot;I think there&#39;ll be a day in the summer when we wake up and think &#39;that was some achievement&#39;. &quot;We&#39;ve pulled it off and we&#39;ve got to be looking at pushing at the other end of the table next year. That&#39;s what we&#39;ve got to aim to do.&quot; Sunderland face Swansea City in the final game of their Premier League campaign on Sunday. Gus Poyet&#39;s side are available at 17/2 with bet365 to win the match 2-1 with Cattermole 10/1 to score at any time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soccer - Rosler has faith in experienced Latics&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wigan Athletic boss Uwe Rosler thinks his side&#39;s big-match experience will help them beat QPR in the semi-finals of the Championship play-offs. The Latics will host the first leg at the DW Stadium and will be keen to win through to Wembley yet again. Wigan, 17/2 with bet365 to beat QPR 2-0 on Friday and 11/4 to win promotion from the Championship, have played at Wembley three times in just over 12 months, having featured in two FA Cup semi-finals as well as beating Manchester City in last year&#39;s final. Former Brentford manager Rosler insists: &quot;The players have plenty of experience in these situations. This squad knows all about big games at Wembley and that can only be a positive. &quot;We will be physically and mentally prepared. It will be important we use the right players at the right time.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soccer - Zabaleta refusing to take anything for granted&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pablo Zabaleta insists Manchester City&#39;s players have the &#39;know-how&#39; to cope with any final-day title nerves. The Citizens&#39; 4-0 victory over Aston Villa on Wednesday leaves Manuel Pellegrini&#39;s side on the verge of a second Premier League crown in three seasons. City will host West Ham United on Sunday, knowing a point will be good enough to send the Etihad Stadium into raptures. A 1-1 draw can be backed at 20/1 with bet365. Zabaleta, 15/2 to score at any time against Sam Allardyce&#39;s side, insists: &quot;We know that things are not over and that we have to go again against West Ham. &quot;We still have many members of the team that were here on the final day two seasons ago. We know we cannot take anything for granted.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/05/georges-premiership-predictions-3-may.html&quot;&gt;Last time&#39;s predictions&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/feeds/4997724465756054567/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7424337262078805962&amp;postID=4997724465756054567' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/4997724465756054567'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/4997724465756054567'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/05/georges-premiership-predictions-may-11.html' title='George&#39;s Premiership Predictions May 11 2014'/><author><name>Soccerphile</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='6' src='http://bp3.blogger.com/_USzog_GOzyA/R-enhnyI37I/AAAAAAAADcs/gy7OPVaMJSY/S220/japan-visitor-logo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7424337262078805962.post-3475236476598572306</id><published>2014-05-08T13:47:00.000+01:00</published><updated>2014-11-05T04:58:01.800Z</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2014 World Cup"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Brazil"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="calendar  England"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="England National Team"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Fifa World Rankings"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="scotland"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="world rankings"/><title type='text'>Fifa World Rankings May 2014</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pYYDc0SabEw/UbByb2DLTDI/AAAAAAAAdn8/TonfgSojRhQ/s1600/fifa-rankings2.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;FIFA World Fifa Rankings&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pYYDc0SabEw/UbByb2DLTDI/AAAAAAAAdn8/TonfgSojRhQ/s200/fifa-rankings2.jpg&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; title=&quot;FIFA World Fifa Rankings&quot; width=&quot;177&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Fifa&#39;s World Rankings for May 2014 were published today at FIFA HQ in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/soccerphile/euro2008/city_guide/zurich.html&quot;&gt;Zurich&lt;/a&gt;, Switzerland.

It is very much grey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one will argue that squad rotation isn&#39;t required to be competitive in multiple tournaments. Given the vast travel distances, more so in East Asia, playing three games in seven or eight days, with, for example, a 30-hour return trip to Australia sandwiched in between will test any player the world over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The issue this year is that, on paper, teams are fielding what can only be described as weaker sides in the ACL, particularly when travelling, and saving their best players for regular league matches on the weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The perception is that the ACL is a clear second priority for clubs, when the AFC are trying to market the competition as the pinnacle for club football in Asia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rhetoric and the reality don&#39;t match up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to get them to match up? It&#39;s the million-dollar question. What can the AFC do to force clubs to field their strongest team? Should they force clubs? Is wielding a big stick the best way to make clubs take the ACL more seriously, or would it just lead to resentment? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their own regulations (section 28) state that:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On entering the Competition, the Club shall automatically undertake:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;f) To field their strongest team throughout the competition&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clubs have taken their rotation policy to the nth degree this season, particularly in the East. More often than not a significant number of their regular best XI have been left out of away trips, with clubs hoping their home form was enough to see them through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That meant inconsistent performances with only two clubs in the East (Western Sydney and Kawasaki) winning more than half their games. Three clubs advanced to the Round of 16 having won only two games.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While you could argue that is a good thing, highlighting the evenness between all teams, you get the sense it&#39;s not a true reflection of the strengths of the various teams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One club who deserve to have the book thrown at them is Guizhou Renhe for their clear contempt in their final game against Western Sydney. Not in the fact that they bought a &#39;B&#39; team, given they had no chance of advancing that was no unexpected, it’s the fact they only named two substitutes and didn&#39;t bring a reserve goalkeeper. It was clear they were disrespecting not only the competition but also their opponents, who duly thumped them 5-0. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It bought in to sharp focus the rotation issue that has cast a shadow over the group stages. But what sanctions can AFC issue? A fine? Given the number of teams that are backed by wealthy owners and corporations, such a punishment may have little effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s clearly a difficult issue and one that AFC need to address to ensure what we have seen this year doesn&#39;t get out of hand in future campaigns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But while the issue dominated discussions, it’s the action on the field that really matters and with the group stages completed we can now look forward to the Round of 16.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the east it is &lt;a href=&quot;http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/01/pohang-steel-korea-title.html&quot;&gt;Pohang Steelers&lt;/a&gt; who are the early favourites after going through the group stage undefeated (Foolad in the West the only other team to achieve that feat). Their most impressive performance came at home against Shandong Luneng, who were challenging them for top spot at the time. More on them later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two goals and a man down after 25 minutes it looked grim for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/soccerphile/news/korean-soccer/acl-final-09-preview.html&quot;&gt;2009 champions&lt;/a&gt;. But for the remaining 65 minutes they played Shandong off the park, despite being a man down, and deservedly walked away from the game with a 2-2 draw. It could easily have been more. They haven&#39;t looked back since, and are on an 11-game winning streak across the ACL and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/k-league&quot;&gt;K League Classic&lt;/a&gt;, where they are two points clear on top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With no foreign players on their roster, they are proving that it&#39;s not all about the money and how much you can spend on foreign players. Lee Myung-ju and Kim Seung-dae are the two leading lights for the defending K League Champions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They will face fellow Korean side Jeonbuk Hyundai in the Round of 16 in one of three &#39;derby&#39; clashes, with Al Ittihad-Al Shabab (Saudi Arabia) and Al Jazira-Al Ain (UAE) the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the most disappointing teams this year had to be Shandong Luneng. After spending big in the off-season, compiling a squad many thought could challenge &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.beijing-visitor.com/china-travel-guides/guangzhou-guide&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Guangzhou&lt;/a&gt; not only domestically but also in the ACL, people expected and assumed they’d be one of the two teams to advance from Group E.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They started well with a win and two draws from their first three games setting them up nicely for the final three games, two of which were at home. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inexplicably they lost all three, suffering the ignominy of finishing last in their group. Defence was their biggest issue. While Vagner Love terrorised defences (he scored five goals in six games), it was their failure to keep them out at the other end that prevented them from advancing. Their 11 goals against was the worst record in the East, and second worst overall.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the West the Saudi clubs look strong, particularly Al Hilal and Al Shabab, while Al Ittihad can never be discounted. And after they failed to qualify for the 2015 ACL, they&#39;ll be looking to make a statement this year.  The UAE&#39;s Al Ain, who struggled domestically this season, are always going to be a contender so long as Asamoah Gyan keeps banging in the goals - he scored seven in the group stages. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#39;t such a good campaign for Qatari clubs, however, with only 2011 champions Al Sadd making it through to the Round of 16, and even that was in doubt until the final moments of their clash with Al Ahli (who they replaced in second).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the AFC looking to overhaul the criteria once again, this time putting in place a system that puts significantly more emphasis on on-field performances, it’s not a great time for clubs to struggle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given how unpredictable the group stage has been, I won&#39;t dare make any predictions for the Round of 16, but one thing we can be sure of is entertainment and quality on the pitch. It&#39;s the one area the ACL rarely fails to deliver. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Copyright ©  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/soccerphile/columnists/paul-williams.html&quot;&gt;Paul Williams&lt;/a&gt; and Soccerphile.com&lt;/b&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/feeds/3273056008931014980/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7424337262078805962&amp;postID=3273056008931014980' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/3273056008931014980'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/3273056008931014980'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/05/afc-champions-league-rotation.html' title='AFC Champions League Rotation'/><author><name>Soccerphile</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='6' src='http://bp3.blogger.com/_USzog_GOzyA/R-enhnyI37I/AAAAAAAADcs/gy7OPVaMJSY/S220/japan-visitor-logo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-VWJd6l-xvb0/UuDQkLaBTsI/AAAAAAAAfMM/O7cuxEU7JOQ/s72-c/acl.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7424337262078805962.post-6446655016807524334</id><published>2014-04-27T10:49:00.000+01:00</published><updated>2014-11-05T04:58:32.306Z</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Bayern Munich"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Carlo Ancelotti"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Champions League"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Munich"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Pep Guardiola"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Real Madrid"/><title type='text'>Champions League Bayern vs Real Madrid</title><content type='html'>&lt;b&gt;Bundesliga title not enough for Guardiola, but European glory may be out of reach this time&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ozren Podnar&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should Bayern Munich lose to Real Madrid in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/champions-league&quot;&gt;Champions League&lt;/a&gt; semifinals on Tuesday 29th of April, Josep Guardiola will be tar-and-feathered by the German press. And worse, by his club&#39;s heavyweights such as Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and Franz Beckenbauer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-oOIocFjB7q8/U1zQpn4jMeI/AAAAAAAAfrI/Kn3Ai88M4Cs/s1600/allianz-arena-1.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Allianz Arena Munich Germany&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-oOIocFjB7q8/U1zQpn4jMeI/AAAAAAAAfrI/Kn3Ai88M4Cs/s1600/allianz-arena-1.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Champions League Bayern vs Real Madrid&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That has always been a risk since the previous manager, Jupp Heynckes, took the Bavarians to the unprecedented quadruple crown last season (Champions League, Bundesliga, DFB Cup and League Cup).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The enormity of the task was not known to Guardiola when he signed for Bayern in January of 2013, but there it is. And after the 0-1 loss in Madrid in the first leg his team face an uphill battle to reach the finals in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.portugalvisitor.com/portugal-city-guides/lisbon-guide&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lisbon&lt;/a&gt; against either Chelsea or Atlético. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, under Pep, Bayern have won this season&#39;s Bundesliga at a record-early date, in late March. They were also crowned European Supercup winners against Chelsea last August and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/world-club-cup&quot;&gt;World Club Cup&lt;/a&gt; winners against Raja Casablanca in December. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cool, but no more than expected of the world&#39;s most-hyped manager and his star-studded squad. Bayern did not bring Guardiola for that but to become the first club to win back-to-back continental titles since AC Milan did it 24 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jCokgfm4j4Q/U1zRWy-67eI/AAAAAAAAfrQ/A2Jwf723xVA/s1600/allianz-arena-2.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Franck Ribery Bayern Munich&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jCokgfm4j4Q/U1zRWy-67eI/AAAAAAAAfrQ/A2Jwf723xVA/s1600/allianz-arena-2.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Franck Ribery&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Munich, a &quot;cursed city&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both in Spain and in Germany much was made of the fact that Munich had always been an unconquerable fortress for Real Madrid. In ten trips to Bayern&#39;s stadium, they lost nine games and drew one. No other European team have caused Madrid so much heartbreak. And the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/soccerphile/wc2006/city_guide/munich.html&quot;&gt;city of Munich&lt;/a&gt; is generally hostile to the blancos: they lost even to München 1860 when the two sides met in the Champions Cup in the late sixties. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, beware: out of ten games played at either the Olympic Stadium or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/soccerphile/wc2006/stadiums/munich-stadium.html&quot;&gt;Allianz Arena&lt;/a&gt;, only three times did Bayern achieve the result that would take them to this year&#39;s finals, and only once in the past 27 years! In 1976, in the glory days of Maier, Beckenbauer, Müller, Hoeness or Roth, the Bavarians defeated Real by 2-0 in the semis (and qualified). The same outcome would put them through on Tuesday evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eleven years later, Bayern thumped Madrid 4-1, also in the semis, before losing the finals in Vienna to Rabah Madjer&#39;s back heel flick. The only other big win, again by 4-1, came in the spring of 2000. And it was not even a cup-tie, but an irrelevant match in the group phase of the Champions League, with both teams already qualified for the quarter-finals. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the same teams met again in the semifinals of the same season, it was Real Madrid that came on top with a 3-2 aggregate thanks to a rare but providential goal by Nicolas Anelka in the second leg in Munich. In the past six home games against the madrilenos, Bayern achieved five 2-1 wins and were held to a 1-1 draw on another occasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-C1xDq6QHqpY/U1zRn_fQ6tI/AAAAAAAAfrY/NAPvq2J2x7o/s1600/allianz-arena-3.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Allianz Arena, Munich, Germany&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-C1xDq6QHqpY/U1zRn_fQ6tI/AAAAAAAAfrY/NAPvq2J2x7o/s1600/allianz-arena-3.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Champions League Bayern vs Real Madrid&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Madrid just too quick&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not one of those results would do the German champions any good this time. And they may also be worried to note that Madrid scored at least once in every one of their last nine away games with Bayern. Should they score again on Tuesday, Guardiola&#39;s men would need at least three goals to remove this ultimate, nasty obstacle on the way to Lisbon. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Real can score, more than once. Their counterattack is arguably the most lethal in the history of the game. There is no defence that Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema or even their super-fast full backs like Fábio Coentrao cannot outrun. In Madrid, they created three clear chances on the break and were unlucky to be just 1-0 up before half-time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guardiola must be concerned about his defence since it proved porous once more this weekend against Werder in the Bundesliga. The visitors went ahead twice before Bayern turn it around to win 5-2. The playing style the Catalan has transplanted from Barcelona onto his current team works  wonders against everybody except opponents who, like Real, have a couple of sprinters upfront, who also happen to be clinical finishers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ancelotti to outfox Pep&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bayern&#39;s defenders are usually deployed in a very advanced position since it is expected of them to participate in the team&#39;s intricate short passing game. But when they give away the ball, there are vast expanses of space behind the central defenders for rivals to exploit. Not many teams have sufficiently rapid players to seize such opportunities, but Real Madrid (and Borussia Dortmund) do and that may prove Bayern&#39;s undoing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The possession Guardiola&#39;s team boast will do nothing to advance their cause. In order to overcome the deficit, Bayern will have to assume risks and take chances, but odds are the things will not play out as he is hoping. For on the other side there awaits a manager who knows everything about defending a slim advantage and striking with lightning-quick counter-attacks. Incidentally, an Italian: Carlo Ancelotti.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is no doubt ironic that the current Madrid&#39;s coach was a regular on AC Milan&#39;s squad who last won two consecutive Champions Cups by defeating none other than Real Madrid on the way to the finals in both seasons. And now he could prevent Bayern to emulate that feat in which he so prominently featured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bayern vs Real Madrid&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The teams have played 21 matches in the European cup competitions, all of them in the Champions League (until 1992 called the European Cup).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1976.

The Italian said: &quot;Against Bayern it&#39;s normal to use the counter and it means you have to defend well.

A midweek win at Firhill formally secured what has been expected all season, although despite the expected nature of the success, Neil Lennon remains adamant that there are still ambitions to fulfil at Parkhead. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dilemma for the club, who have at least another season in the top flight without &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/soccerphile/premier-league/old-firm.html&quot;&gt;Rangers&lt;/a&gt;, is whether to spend or not this summer. Lennon, majority shareholder Dermot Desmond and chief executive Peter Lawwell have met to define the outline of the club&#39;s five-year plan. The budgets and strategies they come up with could take them to eight championships in a row - but it is European success that Lennon has his eye on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Basically the board work that way, a five-year strategy,&quot; said Lennon. &quot;We&#39;re getting round to that again. We have frank and open discussions and it&#39;s always pretty healthy. Dermot&#39;s satisfied with the way things are going and has his finger on the pulse of the club. &quot;I think we&#39;re on the same lines. Don&#39;t get me wrong, it&#39;s not about my elevation - it&#39;s about me elevating Celtic. They&#39;re the same. It&#39;s not about Dermot&#39;s elevation, Peter&#39;s reputation or anything like that, it&#39;s about the security and the future of the club. They have all the information in front of them and that&#39;s the way they lead the club.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Lennon, the aims are more immediate. Having had a fairly paltry return in the cup competitions to date, he craves a treble and a return to the last 16 of the Champions League next term, and would even go so far to suggest that Celtic could burst into the quarter-finals at some stage. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;I&#39;ve done the last 16 now, the next step is &#39;can we go last 16, can we go last eight?&#39;,&quot; Lennon said. &quot;And certainly the treble is a viable incentive for [the players] as well. So there&#39;s a substantial amount to go for. You always have to present challenges for yourself. My worry is, at the back of my mind, if we just have domestic football next year -will I improve myself? That&#39;s just my concern, not the club&#39;s.&quot; With the likes of Stefan Johansen and Leigh Griffiths adjusting well to their new surroundings, the squad is undoubtedly further advanced in its rebuilding than 12 months previously, with Van Dijk the template for new signings who can be persuaded to join in June. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;I would take this squad into the qualifiers but as we progress I would like to add to it,&quot; Lennon said. &quot;We want, if we can, to get business done before the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/world-cup-2014&quot;&gt;World Cup&lt;/a&gt; because some of the players we&#39;re after, if they have a good World Cup their price will elevate.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To consider how seemingly outlandish goals can suddenly become a reality, Lennon needs look no further than his countryman Brendan Rodgers. Long before he was chasing the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/premier-league&quot;&gt;Premier League&lt;/a&gt; title at Liverpool, Lennon visited him at Reading, and the two men have kept in touch since an early season friendly meeting between the two clubs in Dublin this season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;I must say I&#39;m surprised by how well they have done because I always felt Chelsea and Man City would be dominating, but Brendan&#39;s done brilliantly,&quot; Lennon said. &quot;Not just the fact they are winning games but the style of football too. &quot;When I went to see him he had a file, a really thick file, and it was his methodology on the game. Early on in the season we were in contact, largely through text message. But I think at this stage of the season he doesn&#39;t need too many distractions.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rangers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The on-going stresses and tribulations that continue to engulf Rangers off the park may dissuade many from joining the club. But manager Ally McCoist has insisted that he considers himself &#39;the luckiest guy alive&#39; to be in charge of his boyhood team, although he did qualify that statement by admitting that he would like to have assumed control in less turbulent times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Asked if he was feeling the strain of being Ibrox manager in the period since administration, he replied: &quot;It&#39;s the dream job without doubt, perhaps not at the right time but, that said, I am the luckiest guy alive. &quot;To play for the club you supported and then be assistant to Walter Smith and then get the job - I still believe I am the luckiest man alive in managing the club you supported since you were a wee boy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;At best it has been a turbulent two and a half years since even prior to the club going into administration.The problems were there and you could see it coming. The signs were not good around the place and the staff and players could sniff it out.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having led the Ibrox side to their second successive title as they edge their way back to the top flight in Scottish football, McCoist believes that Celtic, perhaps not publicly, are keen to have a strong Rangers snapping at their heels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Celtic thoroughly deserved their league title this year and won it very comfortably,&#39; he said. &quot;They have some very good players but they also lost some, Joe Ledley to Palace, Gary Hooper to Norwich and Victor Wanyama, who was a terrific player for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;So I think from Neil Lennon&#39;s point of view he will want to keep hold of the squad he&#39;s got and to build because, and this is only my opinion, it&#39;s maybe not as difficult for Celtic - but it&#39;s certainly very difficult without real competition in the league. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;History will tell you Rangers and Celtic have always given each other strong competition so Neil has to maintain the standards he has set while also looking to improve.&quot; McCoist admitted he was in the dark as much as anyone when it came to forward planning and budgets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rangers will play in a Championship next season including the likes of Hearts and possibly Dundee, Dunfermline and Falkirk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He admitted he will be under intense pressure to take Rangers back into the top flight to challenge a Celtic side whose bank balance will have been swelled by continued involvement in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/champions-league&quot;&gt;Champions League&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;We are planning already,&quot; said the Ibrox boss. &quot;We have a couple of plans because we don&#39;t know if will we get any money to spend. In an ideal world we would like to plan long term. That would be the perfect scenario where we can bring players in. That would hopefully get us through the league next year and stay with us to challenge in the top flight the year after. That is the ideal scenario and I would love the opportunity to do that but as yet we don&#39;t know if we can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;If we got told the budget is X amount and you can only plan for next season then we will just have to adapt to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;It&#39;s difficult. We have a list of free transfers all over Europe but if you get money to spend there is another market you can look at. The problem we have at the moment is we don&#39;t know if we can shop and where we can shop.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scotland&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Scottish national team have found that the improvements they have enjoyed since Gordon Strachan took charge last year have been reflected in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/fifa-rankings&quot;&gt;FIFA rankings&lt;/a&gt;. The Scots have moved into 22nd place - making them the world&#39;s most improved country. The jump means the Scots have risen an astonishing 47 places since Strachan was appointed in January last year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strachan&#39;s Scots continued their excellent recent run of form with a 1-0 win in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/poland-travel-guide&quot;&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt; last month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was enough for Scotland to be the biggest risers in the world in April&#39;s ranking where they have jumped up 15 places to 22nd. When the former Celtic manager took over last year, Scotland were languishing in 69th place and even dropped as low as 78th spot four months later.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/feeds/881872514381596852/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7424337262078805962&amp;postID=881872514381596852' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/881872514381596852'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/881872514381596852'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/04/scottish-premier-league-news-april-2014.html' title='Scottish Premier League News April 2014'/><author><name>Soccerphile</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='6' src='http://bp3.blogger.com/_USzog_GOzyA/R-enhnyI37I/AAAAAAAADcs/gy7OPVaMJSY/S220/japan-visitor-logo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-P8u_k0m0To8/UrQi0pu5SeI/AAAAAAAAe9o/68TW-3z9mfk/s72-c/spl1.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7424337262078805962.post-6041822747425938692</id><published>2014-04-22T10:56:00.000+01:00</published><updated>2014-11-05T05:22:05.616Z</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Alex Ferguson"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="David Moyes"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="everton"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Manchester United"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Manchester Utd."/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Old Trafford"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Premier League"/><title type='text'>David Moyes Sacked</title><content type='html'>It is easy, with the benefit of hindsight, to suggest that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/david-moyes&quot;&gt;David Moyes&lt;/a&gt; was never likely to be capable of filling Sir Alex Ferguson&#39;s shoes at Manchester United.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rwOruDb8LZc/U1Y8TNEdUkI/AAAAAAAAfqs/DGYsIVlzKuw/s1600/old-trafford-1.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;David Moyes Sacked at Manchester United&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rwOruDb8LZc/U1Y8TNEdUkI/AAAAAAAAfqs/DGYsIVlzKuw/s1600/old-trafford-1.jpg&quot; title=&quot;David Moyes Sacked&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Moyes was appointed as Ferguson&#39;s successor last summer, the unprecedented six-year contract handed to him by the club&#39;s restructured hierarchy gave the strongest indication of all - even more then the ringing endorsement of Ferguson - that he would be given football&#39;s most precious commodity, time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, that time has been called on Moyes only 10 months into his tenure, quick even by recent Premier League standards, which was unflattering compared with the Italian league of 20 years ago by former United defender Gary Neville this week. In a statement, the club said it &quot;would like to place on record its thanks for the hard work, honesty and integrity he brought to the role&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/manchester-united&quot;&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt; - and Moyes in particular - have made a series of miscalculations this season that has left their title defence in tatters. Indeed, according his detractors at Old Trafford, miscalculations would be too soft a description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reports suggest that Moyes has alienated senior players such as Rio Ferdinand, Robin van Persie and Ryan Giggs, which has in turn allowed some of United&#39;s younger squad members to push the boundaries of the Scot&#39;s control further than they would have ever dared under Ferguson&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But even if you doubt the authenticity of such reports, the decision-making of Moyes has been questionable from the beginning, especially when you consider that the primary reason behind his appointment was to provide a consistent transition from Ferguson&#39;s generation-long reign. One of his first decisions was to dispense with the backroom staff that had served his predecessor well in recent seasons and bring in his own team of trusty lieutenants from Everton despite the lack of silverware among them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moyes has also - staggering - not yet named the same starting XI for consecutive matches, while he has been tactically out-thought by not only the experienced managers of Manchester City and Chelsea but also the relative novices at Liverpool and Everton. But Moyes&#39; greatest shortcoming was perhaps his own judgement that he was capable of bridging the enormous gap left by Ferguson&#39;s sudden retirement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ferguson&#39;s own verdict might be called into question on this point, too. That the pair were friends and fellow Scots would have certainly clouded the decision-making process, as would have the feeling that, given time, Moyes would gently, gradually mould the club into his own, just as Ferguson had been allowed to do in the late 1980s before the raft of success enjoyed during the 1990s and 2000s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The benefit of hindsight allows us all to see that managing Manchester United has been a step too far for Moyes at this stage in his career. He has been seriously let down by a number of his senior players - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/no-change-as-united-refuse-to-bow-to-pressure-over-rooney&quot;&gt;Wayne Rooney&lt;/a&gt; excluded it must be mentioned - as well as by the club&#39;s hierarchy during last summer&#39;s disastrous transfer dealings. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Xvw9i41qdY0/U1Y8k4wgqhI/AAAAAAAAfq0/GB1ICCfAr5M/s1600/old-trafford-2.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em;

title=&quot;David Moyes Sacked&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Moyes must still carry the can for a woeful defence of the Premier League crown that the club won by 11 points last season as well as failure in the cup competitions, which has been all the more difficult for supporters to accept because of the numerous insipid displays from their side throughout the campaign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thinness of United&#39;s attacking threat compared with that on offer by champions-elect Liverpool, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/no-bedding-in-period-for-moyes&quot;&gt;Manchester City&lt;/a&gt; and Everton - Moyes&#39; former employers of course - must have left a seriously bad taste in the mouth of the United owners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indeed, Everton&#39;s transformation under Roberto Martinez might not have helped Moyes&#39; plight, with Sunday&#39;s 2-0 win for the Toffees confirming that United would miss out on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/champions-league&quot;&gt;Champions League&lt;/a&gt; football next season and thus allowing the club to fire Moyes with only a one-year payoff under the terms of his contract.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;© Marc Fox &amp;amp;

The 29-year-old has not played for the capital club since first picking up a knee injury and then a thigh complaint in the Champions League quarter-final against Borussia Dortmund on 2nd April. The Portugal talisman had to watch from the stands on Wednesday as his team-mates secured coach Carlo Ancelotti his first trophy in charge of Los Blancos in a 2-1 win against fierce rivals Barcelona in the final of the Copa del Rey at Valencia&#39;s Mestalla. The former Manchester United favourite said he was hoping to be back for the crunch visit of Pep Guardiola&#39;s Bundesliga giants to the Santiago Bernabeu. &quot;I&#39;m really happy. I wanted to play and help the team but my team-mates did a great job. I&#39;m getting better, now I don&#39;t feel any pain,&quot; Ronaldo told the club&#39;s official website. He added: &quot;I might be back in time for next Wednesday or perhaps the second leg of our Champions League tie. &quot;Bit by bit I&#39;m feeling better and what I want more than anything is to be able to help the team out as soon as possible.&quot; Real Madrid are three points behind leaders and city rivals Atletico Madrid in La Liga and are quoted 7/5 by bet365 in the outright betting. Ancelotti&#39;s Treble-chasers can also be backed at 11/4 to win this season&#39;s Champions League.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soccer - Wenger hints at Ozil return&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Club-record signing Mesut Ozil is expected to make his Arsenal return in Sunday&#39;s FA Cup final dress rehearsal against Hull City, manager Arsene Wenger has suggested. The £42.5million deadline-day capture from Real Madrid has not played since 11th March after picking up a hamstring injury against Bayern Munich in the Champions League. Wenger revealed the Germany international &quot;should be available&quot; for the trip to East Yorkshire to take on Steve Bruce&#39;s men at the KC Stadium. The Frenchman also revealed long-term injury-victim Abou Diaby is expected to make his long-awaited return to first-team training on Thursday. The luckless 27-year-old has not played for an entire year because of a serious injury but Wenger played down suggestions he could make his comeback between now and the end of the season. &quot;Abou is back in full training on Thursday,&quot; Wenger added. &quot;It&#39;s very difficult to say [if he will play this season] because he has not played for over a year now, and it&#39;s very difficult for me [to decide]. He looks physically fine, but he has to play one or two games before I consider bringing him back.&quot; Hull have only lost six of 17 home games so far this season in the Premier League and are quoted 7/2 by bet365 in the 90 minutes market, while the draw is available to back at 11/4. Arsenal are currently priced at 3/4 for the away win.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/feeds/2354473495566938286/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7424337262078805962&amp;postID=2354473495566938286' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/2354473495566938286'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/2354473495566938286'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/04/georges-premiership-predictions-april.html' title='George&#39;s Premiership Predictions April 19 2014'/><author><name>Soccerphile</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='6' src='http://bp3.blogger.com/_USzog_GOzyA/R-enhnyI37I/AAAAAAAADcs/gy7OPVaMJSY/S220/japan-visitor-logo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7424337262078805962.post-8525700552819065399</id><published>2014-04-17T20:38:00.000+01:00</published><updated>2014-11-20T13:32:21.870Z</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Copa del Rey"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="FC Barcelona.

Meanwhile, memories of being thrashed 7-0 on aggregate last season by the young pretender Bayern Munich are still raw. Times are tough down the Camp Nou.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most recent clasico saw a crazy league clash at the Bernabeu end 4-3 to the Catalans, so in last night&#39;s Spanish Cup final in Valencia, both sides began more defensively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blaugrana entered the changing rooms at half-time a goal down to their arch rivals, yet made an energetic fight-back and deserved to draw level. Barça then had the upper hand for a while at 1-1 before some Gareth Bale magic and a Neymar miss settled the tie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was more fading Catalan grandeur under the microscope. The mesmerising tiki-taka through the middle had largely gone, replaced by a few short exchanges before the ball was spread to the flanks for a lob into the box from Andres Iniesta or Daniel Alves, neither of whom are natural wingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Iniesta, Xavi and especially &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/soccerphile/players/lionel-messi.html&quot;&gt;Lionel Messi&lt;/a&gt; were often invisible and many a cross found a white shirt. It was as if they were mourning former totem Pep Guardiola so much they had tried to ape Bayern&#39;s style, yet without the requisite type of player.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alves wasted many touches and looked angry and frustrated. Messi saw one shot saved but dropped deep and influenced little. Neymar was elusive for both Real&#39;s defence and his attacking teammates.&lt;br /&gt;Fabregas pulled a few useful strings in midfield but the ensemble did not convince in any meaningful way. The ferocious pressing of a few years back was nowhere to be seen. This was a Barça, if not firing blanks, then revolving at 33rpm instead of 45.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Real employed their familiar anti-Barça plan of counter-attacking at speed, with flat blanks of four behind them. Cristiano Ronaldo was out injured yet Angel Di Maria and Bale had plenty of velocity to make up for him and both scored. Indeed, it has been said that Bale plays better when Ronaldo is not there stealing his space, while similar things are whispered about Messi and Neymar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Di Maria was particularly dangerous in the first half while Bale, far from energetic throughout, bided his time until a golden chance sprung up twenty minutes from the end and he was able to switch on his deadly afterburners.The Welshman&#39;s 50-yard run and strike was a wonder goal, but Barcelona had left their back door open for him to steal in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They had a total of six in the opposition box when Daniel Carvajal headed Messi&#39;s cross out to begin the move. Barcelona were not alive to the risk of a swift counter so when Fabio Coentrao played the ball quickly upfield, Bale had already ghosted clear of Sergio Busquets, who jogged back exhausted and unable to give chase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fleet-footed Cardiffian had spied yards of open grass ahead and as the ball was played to him close to the halfway line, a scoring chance was already on the cards. Bartra&#39;s attempted obstruction was no obstacle as the Welshman just sprinted around him, invading Barça&#39;s technical area momentarily before bearing down remorselessly on goal. Kick and rush still works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barcelona are four points off the top with five games to go, third behind two teams who unlike them are still in the Champions League. Having lost the Copa del Rey, it looks like a trophy-less season for the team dubbed the best of all time when they won the last of their European Cups, three years ago in London.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what has gone awry?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a start there is the age question. Is the backbone of the side getting long in the tooth? And if so why was young starlet Thiago sold to Bayern and two promising youngsters loaned out - Gerard Deulofeu to Everton and Bojan Krkic to Ajax? At 36, Carles Puyol is in his final season, Xavi is 34, Alves 30 and Iniesta and Mascherano 29. Yet Pique is 27, Fabregas, Messi &amp;nbsp;and Pedro 26 and Busquets 25, while Neymar is only 22.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neymar&#39;s nine goals in 25 outings is a moderate return so far on his £46.8 million transfer, but time is on his side and his stock should surely rise after this summer’s World Cup Finals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Brazilian of course was at the heart of a transfer scandal involving tax evasion which ended up with Barcelona’s President Sandro Rosell resigning over tax evasion in February. Further investigations into the club&#39;s recruitment of under-18 boys ended with FIFA banning the club from buying any players until the summer of 2015.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What was strange was that the club was warned a year before and did nothing to change its practices, as if it felt it was untouchable. Whispers have long circulated that UEFA has a soft spot for Barça, yet blaugrana aficionados have countered with the theory that Real Vice-President Pedro Lopez Jimenez was the driving force behind the ban, abusing his position on FIFA’s Player Status Committee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet unless an appeal succeeds, Barça will have to go through all of next season without reinforcement from outside the club at a time when the youth system is not producing superstars. On and off the pitch, this season has been one of anguish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While in theory boardroom activities should not leak onto on-field actions, the bad headlines and press attention for the wrong reasons cannot have helped the squad’s morale as they registered disappointing results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surely a side boasting the world’s greatest player should not be moaning one might think, but Messi has not been sensational this season. He was injured for a total of almost three months and found the changing system means he has less influence in attack than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are murmurs that he is keeping something in reserve for the World Cup Finals in June, a suspicion not helped by the permanent presence at the Camp Nou of an Argentine F.A. physiotherapist. The FIFA World Cup would of course be the jewel in Messi’s crown and put him on an even footing in the annals with his nation’s hero Diego Maradona.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the malaise is largely a prolonged hangover from the wondrous era of Guardiola which ended two seasons ago. It was almost impossible for that golden age to be replicated or topped, and a radical transformation of the club is required instead of producing perennially pale imitations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tito Vilanova was unlucky to be diagnosed with cancer barely a season into his job, meaning Gerardo Martino was handed the poisoned chalice of a great side having peaked and needing overhaul, while bearing the psychological imprint of its former leader, an unenviable task much like David Moyes&#39; at Manchester United.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What Guardiola honed of course was a system everyone understood, a playing style based on short diagonal passing triangles creating an attacking force which advanced up the middle until it crashed like a wave on the edge of the opposition&#39;s penalty box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Understanding the system came from having being schooled in La Masia and having played together for so many years that it became telepathic. Yet Martino &amp;amp; Neymar are newly arrived from another continent and other clubs. Martino has tried to install a more direct approach than before, but without the time to procure the players necessary for a new system, a muddle has ensued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Argentine&#39;s appointment looks decidedly like a stop-gap until the club land their intended fish, in much the same way it callously used Bobby Robson for a season until Louis Van Gaal became available. Yet who that special one is we will have to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The club probably should have reinforced the defence given Puyol&#39;s recurrent knee problems and found a quality partner for Piqué instead of making midfielder Javier Mascherano play at centre-back. It could also have invested in genuine wide men if that was the system to be used, but instead went for the marquee signing of Neymar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scoring more goals than the opposition is one way to win games, but a club neglects its defence at its peril and it appears Barcelona are less interested in backline recruitment. If Bayern are the leaders in world soccer right now it seems sensible to learn from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bavarians press like the Barça of old, have recognizable strikers and in Frank Ribéry and Arjen Robben two world-class widemen. But they are also physically impressive and perhaps Barcelona should improve their speed and strength to compete with the likes of Bale, Ronaldo and Guardiola&#39;s new boys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day however, Barcelona, as its motto reminds us, remains &#39;more than a club&#39; and its star will rise again. Soccer success comes in waves and there is no guarantee of sustaining it. Golden generations never occur on a regular basis and when a crop of several top players arrives at once but is not replicated for years, the reasons are never clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The competition across Europe is also fierce with millions being invested by arriviste oligarchs and sheikhs in new powers like Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain to add to the existing powers in England, Germany and Italy. With the rise of Atletico Madrid, Spain itself is now hosting a three-horse dynasty for the first time in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blaugrana will rise again, there is no doubt. With a vast sold-out stadium about to be expanded to 105,000 seats, a long history of being run by its members and its greater symbolism in Catalan folklore, there is no prospect of F.C. Barcelona continuing to decline as a football power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this is one season they will want to airbrush out of the official history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(c) Sean O&#39;Conor &amp;amp; Soccerphile</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/feeds/8525700552819065399/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7424337262078805962&amp;postID=8525700552819065399' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/8525700552819065399'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/8525700552819065399'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/04/what-is-wrong-with-barca.html' title='What is wrong with Barça?

This year there can be no argument that Brisbane Roar has been that team.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is where the debate regarding the merit of a finals system becomes interesting.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a first-past-the-post system, and with no relegation in the A-League, such was Brisbane&#39;s dominance this season the season as a contest would have ended weeks ago, with the final few rounds reduced to being, effectively, dead rubbers, except for the battle for the remaining &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/asian-champions-league&quot;&gt;ACL&lt;/a&gt; spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, given the way some clubs seem to treat participation in the ACL that might be something some would be happy to avoid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet with a finals system in place, the final few rounds generated excitement as teams swapped and changed positions all the way up to the final minute of the final game as Sydney’s last minute winner saw them climb above Adelaide into fifth, and set up an Elimination Final against arguably their biggest rival, Melbourne Victory. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the process, however, the Premiership gets undervalued, particularly by FFA who seem intent on playing down its significance so as to not take away from the finals series. One just has to look at the low-key trophy presentations since the A-League’s inception to get an idea of where the Premiership sits in the pecking order according to the FFA. Finals are king, and by some margin, with the Grand Final winner (the &#39;Champion&#39;) the team recognised as the best of the season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And rightly so, in my opinion.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finals are an Australian tradition, across all sports, and whilst football shouldn’t always borrow from other sports on this occasion it is something that works. Just look at attendances, television ratings, media interest. Finals matter in Australia. And for the most part, the deserving Champion has emerged at the end of each season. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#39;s hope that continues this season as Brisbane is the only club that truly deserve the title of Champion this season. The inconsistency, and at times, terrible form of other sides means there is only one deserving Champion this season. It would be an injustice should any other club hold aloft the toilet seat on May 4. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While following the other codes with a finals system is fine, one area the FFA and the A-League should be a leader is with simultaneous kick offs in the final round. Damien de Bohun&#39;s rationale for not having simultaneous kick offs, which is standard in almost all leagues across the world, was, quite frankly, a joke. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Television, time zones, stadium availability he cried. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has he not heard of the red button on his FOXTEL remote? Fox Sports utilise it every weekend with their EPL coverage and did likewise with their Saturday night NRL coverage. It is entirely possible to screen five games at one time. Imagine the drama on the final day, especially one like this year when every game mattered and every goal altered the outcome of the top six.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the fixture already manipulated to within an inch of its life, time zones aren&#39;t an excuse with any credibility. There was a round earlier this season when all five games were played in New South Wales. It&#39;s tough for Wellington and Perth, but scheduling the final round entirely on the East Coast isn&#39;t, or shouldn&#39;t, be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even Adelaide, with only a 30-minute time difference, could comfortably host a game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stadium availability is the only excuse that has some merit given the difficulties in obtaining access to multi-use stadia when the three other football codes are also in-season. However, it is not insurmountable. With careful planning it can be overcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing lacking is the will to actually make it happen. It&#39;s no longer good enough for the FFA to dismiss it out of hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the same debate has been had in the other football codes, who also steadfastly refuse to consider the option, it&#39;s time for the FFA to stop being a follower and be a leader. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/soccerphile/columnists/paul-williams.html&quot;&gt;Paul Williams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/feeds/8933740405411127839/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7424337262078805962&amp;postID=8933740405411127839' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/8933740405411127839'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/8933740405411127839'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/04/a-league-finals-2014.html' title='A-League Finals 2014'/><author><name>Soccerphile</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='6' src='http://bp3.blogger.com/_USzog_GOzyA/R-enhnyI37I/AAAAAAAADcs/gy7OPVaMJSY/S220/japan-visitor-logo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Wlto3i3SO0k/UwXmGtt5TKI/AAAAAAAAfWw/Yz_Qr9_0O3Y/s72-c/160px-A-Leaguelogo.png" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7424337262078805962.post-308763622327650097</id><published>2014-04-15T21:30:00.002+01:00</published><updated>2014-11-27T17:21:57.830Z</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="English Football"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="English Premier League"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="FA Cup"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Hillsborough"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Liverpool"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Sean O&#39;Conor"/><title type='text'>The Meaning of Hillsborough 25 Years On</title><content type='html'>25 years ago today, 96 Liverpool fans died at Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield, asphyxiated following a crush in a spectator pen at the Leppings Lane end of the ground. 766 fans in total were injured, 300 of whom required hospitalisation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Cry4BF5IRSs/U05cqrthlcI/AAAAAAAAfps/Z4jt2kXZw98/s1600/rd28b.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;The Meaning of Hillsborough 25 Years On&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Cry4BF5IRSs/U05cqrthlcI/AAAAAAAAfps/Z4jt2kXZw98/s1600/rd28b.jpg&quot; title=&quot;The Meaning of Hillsborough 25 Years On&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Liverpool v Nottingham Forest F.A. Cup semi-final was abandoned barely six minutes into the match as a tragedy of horrific proportions was unfolding across England&#39;s airwaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The aftermath was extraordinary, with an entire nation momentarily convulsed by the senseless carnage. English football came to a standstill, and Liverpool&#39;s manager and players said it felt impossible to continue playing the season after such a tragedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the whole country was touched in sympathy, the playing-out of the disaster was particularly Northern, involving three cities born of the 19th century industrial revolution: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.britain-visitor.com/uk-city-guides/liverpool-guide&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt;, Nottingham and Sheffield. The blood spilt was largely working-class and in the resulting tableau football still flew the flag of the people&#39;s religion, a remnant of close-knit solidarity in a post-industrial age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an age of increasing individualism and dying collectivism, those Liverpool supporters wore the same colours, sang the same songs, surged into the ground together and were crushed and died as one. And Merseyside&#39;s very public reaction to the deaths - a tapestry of flags and scarves, packed cathedrals and wailing families, was decidedly Victorian in its sensibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had the tragedy occurred in London or the South of England the mourning would have been more private and curtailed. Yet this cultural nuance was lost on some right-wing Southerners, such as conservative commentator Simon Heffer, who was angry at the victims&#39; relatives and boldly claimed that &quot;Liverpool fans were killed by the thuggishness and ignorance of other Liverpool fans.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunday Times writer Edward Pearce opined, &quot;The shrine in the Anfield goalmouth, the cursing of the police, all the theatricals, come sweetly to a city which is already the world capital of self-pity.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Britain&#39;s best selling tabloid The Sun, prompted by Conservative M.P. Irvine Patnick, went further and claimed that dying Liverpool fans had been stolen from, sexually assaulted and urinated upon by their comrades, in a notorious front-page splash entitled &quot;The Truth.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The then government was hardly football-friendly, considering its rowdy supporters a nuisance at best and a national disgrace at worst. Until the Taylor Report into Hillsborough destroyed its credibility, a scheme to force all fans to carry special I.D. cards was being planned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sports minister hastily despatched to Sheffield was the diminutive and shrill former rowing cox Colin Moynihan, whose clipped accent and private school background could scarcely have made him less qualified to understand northern football culture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although government ministers hurried to be photographed in Sheffield, the Thatcher administration&#39;s cultural distancing was laid bare, confirming many a suspicion it did not really care about the Northern cities, whose allegiances it had assumed to belong to the opposition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liverpool was a decidedly left-wing place, but with a special history that set it apart from the rest of the country. With quick access to the Atlantic and the Irish Sea, its deep-water harbour meant that since the 1800s it had become a working city of docks, cranes, ships and ocean liners. It had long been used to African and Irish immigration, lived off transatlantic trade including slavery and managed a religious divide unique for an English city.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the Beatles made the Scouse accent famous across the world, the docks were starting to close and by 1989 Liverpool was reeling in the social wreckage left by industrial collapse. Nottingham and Sheffield had also witnessed decline but still profited from the labour of coal-miners, whom the Prime Minister had dubbed &quot;The Enemy Within&quot; during their bitter conflict a few years earlier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The people of Liverpool had no option but to take control of the situation: Anfield became a sea of scarves and flowers of condolence, a charity single topped the charts and an appeal raised £12 million. Whatever the divisions, the nation appeared to come together in grief and consolation in a fleeting return to the spirit of the Blitz. There is thus some nostalgia for what was a famous cultural moment of the 1980s, a decade when politics and identity really mattered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Football fans felt a particular brotherhood, and I well remember collections at grounds for the appeal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the semi-final itself was eventually replayed in Manchester, a surreal atmosphere enveloped the occasion, with Nottingham Forest coach &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/soccerphile/managers/brian-clough.html&quot;&gt;Brian Clough&lt;/a&gt; admitting before kick-off his team was in &quot;a no-win situation&quot;. Forest manfully respected the nobility of the sport by trying to win, but Kenny Dalglish&#39;s side was in a rabid mood, exorcising their demons as they tore into Clough&#39;s team, eventually winning 3-1 before lifting the cup itself in May.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wembley dismantled its hated fences for that game, and across the nation, the cages which had imprisoned supporters like animals since the 1970s were taken down, never to return. Such was the feeling of catharsis after Hillsborough that English soccer hooliganism lost its appeal and would never dictate the direction of the national sport again. It was undoubtedly a watershed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Justice Taylor&#39;s report analysed the tragedy precisely, yet drew the controversial conclusion, having been egged on by the Football Association, that installing all-seater stadia was the way forward, when standing can be perfectly safe, as German football proves today. The conversion of the nation&#39;s grounds to all-seated arenas began in earnest, initially aided by F.A. grants and later by the windfall of TV money from Rupert Murdoch&#39;s Sky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fans argued against the death of the terraces on phone-ins and in print, yet were powerless to prevent the transformation. English stadia certainly became safer as a result of Hillsborough and would never be again the &quot;medieval fortresses&quot; which had horrified Taylor, yet the sport lost an extraordinary atmosphere to be mourned ever after by the &#39;terrace generation&#39;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a mistake, as is often claimed, to argue that the Taylor Report and by extension Hillsborough helped midwife the Premier League. Technology had made satellite TV possible and a number of companies spotted there was a gap in the market for regular live football. As England&#39;s No.1 sport, football was always going to be snapped up by the highest bidder, all-seat stadia or no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;25 years later, the fulsome tributes to the 96 victims are a measure of the emotional strength of Liverpool as a city and football&#39;s undimmed power to unite, while the new inquest is a pertinent reminder of the immense and unresolved pain the tragedy caused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new age of the Premier League since 1993, along with its &#39;year zero&#39; statistics erasing what came before means some may look on Hillsborough as an embarrassing detail of the past, or a merely local issue. Yet Liverpool fans&#39; refusal to forget while the team returns as a force heading for this year&#39;s title, and perhaps the personal connection of skipper Steven Gerrard, who lost a cousin that day, has meant &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/soccerphile/news/news28.html&quot;&gt;Hillsborough&lt;/a&gt; remains a hot topic in English football in 2014.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What remains frustratingly unresolved a quarter of a century on is the blame for it all. While some tried and failed to smear the supporters, the police&#39;s handling of the event, the design and maintenance of the stadium and the actions of the emergency services have never come under proper scrutiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The persistent campaign of &#39;Justice for the 96&#39; never died down, and finally bore fruit a couple of years ago. In September 2012, the Hillsborough Independent Panel, which had been formed the year before, exonerated the fans of any blame and reported that an astonishing 116 witness statements had been doctored by the police. It also concluded up to 41 of the 96 lives could have been saved had the emergency services been properly prepared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of 2012, the initial verdicts of accidental death were quashed by the Lord Chief Justice and a fresh inquest was launched, which is hearing testimony as we speak. Amid the commemoration of an unspeakable loss, the fusion of football and religion which filled Anfield today reminds us of the healing powers of community and friendship, and at the heart of that memory burns a defiant flame of justice undimmed by time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trevor Hicks, the highest-profile campaigner, who lost two daughters at Hillsborough, &amp;nbsp;had told the inquest earlier this week,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;To lose both your children is devastating, It&#39;s not that it&#39;s twice as bad, it&#39;s that you lose everything, the present, the future, any purpose.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today he reminded the thousands gathered in the stadium today how strong they had all been:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&quot;We stuck together,&quot; he said. &quot;We pulled, we pushed, and we refused to lie down. We refused to go away.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following the failure of a number of private prosecutions against the South Yorkshire Police, the release of a number of previously withheld documents could finally see those negligent that fateful afternoon face justice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only then will the families and friends of the dead feel public vindication, although their personal losses will remain, tied to an unforgettable date:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 15th of April 1989.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;(c) Sean O&#39;Conor &amp;amp; Soccerphile&lt;/i&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/feeds/308763622327650097/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7424337262078805962&amp;postID=308763622327650097' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/308763622327650097'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/308763622327650097'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/04/the-meaning-of-hillsborough-25-years-on.html' title='The Meaning of Hillsborough 25 Years On'/><author><name>Sean O&#39;Conor</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='33' height='20' src='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_alcLfIha2wA/SfGD9nB7_6I/AAAAAAAAA9w/hefDCUsPw00/S220/puma.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Cry4BF5IRSs/U05cqrthlcI/AAAAAAAAfps/Z4jt2kXZw98/s72-c/rd28b.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7424337262078805962.post-8620609776958834374</id><published>2014-04-14T02:54:00.003+01:00</published><updated>2014-11-05T05:22:59.229Z</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="1950 World Cup"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2014 World Cup"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Brazil"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Spain"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Uruguay"/><title type='text'>History Tells Us That Brazil May Not Actually Be Favorites for 2014 World Cup</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JIbffVc5hCo/UyBPPWfUvTI/AAAAAAAAffY/dXd6xhClrnE/s1600/world-cup-2014.gif&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;World Cup 2014, Brazil&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JIbffVc5hCo/UyBPPWfUvTI/AAAAAAAAffY/dXd6xhClrnE/s1600/world-cup-2014.gif&quot; title=&quot;World Cup 2014&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;With the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/world-cup-2014&quot;&gt;2014 World Cup&lt;/a&gt; taking place in the warm confines of Brazil this summer, many experts and fans alike have basically come to the consensus that this the Brazilian World Cup to lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The host nation has an incredibly talented squad, a pure striker in Neymar who is ready to burst on the international scene, and a pride that is simply unmatched by any other soccer nation on the planet.  In front of their vibrant home fans, the Brazilians should stroll to glory!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But one thing that might actually crush this blind hope is a   little trip down memory lane. 2014 will actually   be the second time that Brazil has hosted a World Cup, with the first edition   coming in 1950. That year was also   supposed to be a resounding victory for the host country of Brazil, but   instead, it became a great soccer tragedy widely known as the &quot;Maracanazo&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 1950 World Cup was a strange one in many ways. Because of World War II, the event had not   been held since 1938, and by 1950 there were many famous soccer teams that took   no part in the tournament, including France, Germany, Argentina, Belgium, the   Soviet Union, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Turkey. Nevertheless the tournament would go on, and   still did contain some famous contenders like Italy, Spain, Uruguay, England,   the United States, Mexico, and Yugoslavia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another strange quality to the 1950 World Cup was the   organization. Because of teams dropping   out, only 14 teams participated, and one of the 4 groups contained just Uruguay   and Bolivia. But Brazil had a group they   could dominate, featuring Mexico, Switzerland, and Yugoslavia.Brazil certainly liked their chances, but   with the event having not occurred in over a decade, it was hard to place a   finger on any favorites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That all changed in the first game between Brazil and   Mexico. Brazil won 4-0 thanks in large   part to a brace by the fantastic striker at that time Ademir. Although a draw with Switzerland was not   ideal, Brazil pushed on to the final round with a win over Yugoslavia, Ademir   again scoring a goal! The final round   would be a round robin affair with the 4 group winners taking part.Spain and Sweden both won their groups, while Uruguay turned a few heads with an 8-0 rout of Bolivia, but were still seen as   outsiders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the final round, Brazil again opened strongly. They routed Sweden 7-1 (Ademir with a hat   trick) and trounced Spain 6-1. Other   potent Brazilians from this team included Cico and Zizinho, and they played   beautiful soccer that wowed the spectators. Meanwhile, Uruguay struggled.   They could only draw 2-2 against Spain and barely beat Sweden 3-2 with a   late goal by Miguez. Heading into the   last match, Brazil was a team on fire and needed just a draw to be crowned   champions. Uruguay looked shaky at best   and needed to win. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The days leading up to the match were a party for Brazilian   fans who had already declared themselves as champions. The worldwide press agreed with these   sentiments. A special song was being composed   for the soccer team of Brazil, FIFA president Jules Rimet had a speech written in   Portuguese for the impending &quot;winners&quot;, and victorious medals had already been   assembled for the Brazilian players.   Everyone seemed to forget the simple fact that there was still a soccer   match to be played.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the morning of the final game, Uruguay captain Obdulio Varela collected a batch of newspapers (all declaring Brazil to be the World  Cup champions) and brought them forth to his teammates, instructing them to pee  on them!&amp;nbsp; In the dressing room, he  brought forth a rousing speech, urging his players to not be intimidated by  their opponents and go forth with an offensive strategy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This famously contradicted with the views of  the Uruguayan coach Juan Lopez, who had wished for his players to defend. But the players then had to march into a  stadium filled with nearly 200,000 roaring fans, nearly all of which supported  Brazil.&amp;nbsp;It was the largest crowd for a  soccer match in history!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something tells me that such a monstrous crowd may have  actually played to the favor of Uruguay.  Due to all the pre-match hype and declarations of glory, Brazil was  under immense pressure.&amp;nbsp; For such a proud  soccer country, they had yet to actually attain the World Cup, and in front of  their fans this was supposed to be their coronation.&amp;nbsp;Even the mightiest of contenders can falter  under such circumstances!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/i_pkFXqnpF4&quot; width=&quot;420&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The match began tensely as this weight was firmly upon their  Brazilian shoulders.&amp;nbsp;At half time the  score was still tied 0-0 and Uruguay was gaining hope that they could snatch  victory. But Brazil scored early in the  second half and the party was full on!&amp;nbsp;  Friaca had broken through and beat the keeper, sending the crowds into  frenzied celebrations.&lt;br /&gt;Varela played a typical soccer stall tactic and began arguing  a nonexistent offside call.&amp;nbsp; Eventually  the crowd had settled from their cheers due to the delay and the game  continued.&amp;nbsp; This move may have been the  vital act that prevented an all-out trouncing from occurring.&lt;br /&gt;Uruguay then took command of the game and played with an  immense spirit beyond what people thought was capable.&amp;nbsp;Schiaffino and Ghiggia both scored goals as  the half winded down, and by the time of the final whistle, Uruguay had become  the champions! &lt;br /&gt;An eerie silence descended upon the stadium. There was no presentation for Uruguay simply  because no one had thought they would win.  The trophy was merely placed in Varela’s hands as the stadium began to  empty.&amp;nbsp; Despair was widespread throughout  Brazil as people failed to believe their eyes.&amp;nbsp;  There were even reports of fans committing suicide!&amp;nbsp; The horror became known as the &quot;Maracanazo&quot;  and Brazilian football would never again be the same. Players were booted from the team  permanently.&amp;nbsp;They even discarded their  white uniforms forever, taking on the current yellow home jerseys.&amp;nbsp;In essence, it was a national tragedy!&amp;nbsp;So can something of the same sort actually  happen now, 64 years removed from this infamous occasion?&lt;br /&gt;You better believe it can! The latest odds makers only mark Brazil as 3/1 favorites to lift the  cup. While those odds are the best among the contenders, it would still be less than a 50% certainty that Brazil  should take home the title!&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, with so many close competitors like Germany, the Netherlands,  Argentina, Portugal, Spain, Italy, and even Uruguay all vying for glory, Brazil  will have an even tougher task at winning the World Cup than they did in 1950. &lt;br /&gt;In some way, I could even see Uruguay  completing the feat once again.&amp;nbsp; They  have top class strikers in Luis Suarez and Edinson Cavani, and I am sure that  they are being reminded regularly about that famous triumph in 1950.&lt;br /&gt;However, this 2014 World Cup progress, we can  be certain of one thing.&amp;nbsp; This will be no  cake walk for Brazil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;© Nicholas Spiller &amp;amp; Soccerphile.com&lt;/b&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/feeds/8620609776958834374/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7424337262078805962&amp;postID=8620609776958834374' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/8620609776958834374'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/8620609776958834374'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/04/history-tells-us-that-brazil-may-not.html' title='History Tells Us That Brazil May Not Actually Be Favorites for 2014 World Cup'/><author><name>Soccerphile</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='6' src='http://bp3.blogger.com/_USzog_GOzyA/R-enhnyI37I/AAAAAAAADcs/gy7OPVaMJSY/S220/japan-visitor-logo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JIbffVc5hCo/UyBPPWfUvTI/AAAAAAAAffY/dXd6xhClrnE/s72-c/world-cup-2014.gif" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7424337262078805962.post-7331361705558414078</id><published>2014-04-11T12:43:00.000+01:00</published><updated>2014-11-05T05:23:09.780Z</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Betting"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="English Premier League"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="football betting"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Premiership"/><title type='text'>George&#39;s Premiership Predictions April 12</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href=&quot;http://imstore.bet365affiliates.com/Tracker.aspx?AffiliateId=3771&amp;amp;AffiliateCode=365_027632&amp;amp;CID=358&amp;amp;PID=149&amp;amp;TID=3&amp;amp;LNG=1&amp;amp;DID=27&quot;

The Red Devils were knocked out of this season&#39;s competition by holders Bayern Munich on Wednesday evening, and United are set to miss out next season as they currently lie down in seventh place in the Premier League. However, Moyes is determined to bring in new players this summer to try and ensure that United are back among the European elite in 2015/16, stressing that his side&#39;s absence from Europe shouldn&#39;t last long. He told reporters: &quot;My focus is on getting a side together to get back in the Champions League. &quot;Any players we&#39;ve quietly discussed it with are more than happy to join Manchester United. They know it&#39;s not a long-term thing. &quot;We&#39;re looking to spend the right money on players who are available and it&#39;s not anything to do with the Champions League.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soccer - Courtois sweats on semi-final draw&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Atletico Madrid loan goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois is set to miss his side&#39;s Champions League semi-final if they are paired with his parent club Chelsea. Atleti, who are 9/2 with bet365 to be crowned European champions for the first time, would be forced to pay a major fee to the Blues to field Courtois and they are unlikely to be able to do so. Atletico president Enrique Cerezo told Spanish radio station Onda Cero: &quot;The problem is whether Courtois can play if we get Chelsea in the draw. &quot;There is something in the contract. For him to play we would have to pay a large quantity of money, a figure we cannot pay.&quot; If Courtois is forced to miss out, Atleti will be forced to turn to former Athletic Bilbao and Deportivo La Coruna keeper Daniel Aranzubia, who has only featured on two occasions so far this season. Courtois will be clear to play if Atletico are drawn against either Bayern Munich or Real Madrid.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/feeds/7331361705558414078/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7424337262078805962&amp;postID=7331361705558414078' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/7331361705558414078'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/7331361705558414078'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/04/georges-premiership-predictions-april-12.html' title='George&#39;s Premiership Predictions April 12'/><author><name>Soccerphile</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='6' src='http://bp3.blogger.com/_USzog_GOzyA/R-enhnyI37I/AAAAAAAADcs/gy7OPVaMJSY/S220/japan-visitor-logo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7424337262078805962.post-5198689019800207076</id><published>2014-04-11T11:00:00.000+01:00</published><updated>2014-11-05T05:29:20.060Z</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Brazil"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="England National Team"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="FIFA"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Fifa World Rankings"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="World Cup 2014"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="world rankings"/><title type='text'>Fifa World Rankings April 2014</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pYYDc0SabEw/UbByb2DLTDI/AAAAAAAAdn8/TonfgSojRhQ/s1600/fifa-rankings2.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;FIFA World Fifa Rankings&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pYYDc0SabEw/UbByb2DLTDI/AAAAAAAAdn8/TonfgSojRhQ/s200/fifa-rankings2.jpg&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; title=&quot;FIFA World Fifa Rankings&quot; width=&quot;177&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Fifa&#39;s World Rankings for March 2014 were published yesterday at FIFA HQ in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/soccerphile/euro2008/city_guide/zurich.html&quot;&gt;Zurich&lt;/a&gt;, Switzerland.

Last year five new Premier League bosses were appointed during the close season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the incessant opprobrium heaped upon Arsene Wenger, Spurs&#39; Tim Sherwood is the bookies&#39; favourite to be pushed next, followed by West Brom&#39;s Pepe Mel and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.britain-visitor.com/uk-city-guides/newcastle-guide&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Newcastle&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s Alan Pardew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The merry-go-round is revolving so fast, the rewards of top-flight survival so high and the desperation of directors to avoid relegation so painful that at least half of the coaching roles on offer must be, as Graham Taylor said of England, impossible jobs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Michael Laudrup could bring Swansea their first major trophy and a host of admiring suitors but then be shown the door less than a year later following one win in ten, nobody is safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A fear of relegation is of course not the only reason for dismissal: Andre Vilas-Boas was booted out by Spurs with the team in seventh and having won eight out of sixteen matches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lust for short-term success militates against the sort of long-term planning the best teams have benefited from, leaving the hapless managers in Catch-22 positions, with no job security and an ever-present fear of the boot after a run of duff scorelines. Forget that new youth policy, the psychologist, advanced conditioning and new playing style you had in mind when you took the job, we need to get the ball into the box or I am out of a job on Monday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give him time is the perennial mayday call for managers in trouble, but since no-one can specify how long is enough, directors tend to plump for the fear factor, shift the blame and wield the knife. If Fulham go down this season, the owners can always blame it on Martin Jol instead of the mid-season upheaval his abrupt departure and the hasty appointing of his inexperienced assistant brought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of today, the bottom seven teams in the Premier League have all fired their managers this season, which makes Norwich&#39;s move with five games to go look like a clueless card, a last-ditch throw of the dice, or what they aptly call in American Football, a &#39;Hail Mary.&#39;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;God help us indeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;(c) Sean O&#39;Conor &amp;amp; Soccerphile&lt;/i&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/feeds/5844657155506324269/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7424337262078805962&amp;postID=5844657155506324269' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/5844657155506324269'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/5844657155506324269'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/04/a-race-that-never-ends.html' title='A Race that never ends'/><author><name>Sean O&#39;Conor</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='33' height='20' src='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_alcLfIha2wA/SfGD9nB7_6I/AAAAAAAAA9w/hefDCUsPw00/S220/puma.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-fT2fA8lTbCc/VHxprcEoayI/AAAAAAAAiIs/qioJB4GGhck/s72-c/socc_logo.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7424337262078805962.post-2698438031857891355</id><published>2014-04-07T19:19:00.000+01:00</published><updated>2014-11-05T05:29:31.139Z</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="English Premier League"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Manchester City"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Sean O&#39;Conor"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="season tickets"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Tottenham Hotspur"/><title type='text'>£40 a goal adds insult to Spurs&#39; injury</title><content type='html'>It has been a troubling season for &lt;b&gt;Tottenham Hotspur&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a £100 million summer spending spree and the capture of much-coveted talents like Christian Eriksen and Jan Vertonghen, Spurs failed to spark and fired coach &lt;b&gt;Andre Vilas-Boas&lt;/b&gt; in December in the wake of &amp;nbsp;a 5-0 home humiliation by Liverpool which left the North Londoners seventh in the Premier League.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tim Sherwood&lt;/b&gt; enjoyed a brief honeymoon but with six games to go the club are seventh again, out of the Europa League and need a miracle to reach the Champions League qualifying positions. &lt;b&gt;Louis Van Gaal&lt;/b&gt; is widely tipped to take over at White Hart Lane next season and with a new stadium in the pipeline for 2017, there are nonetheless reasons to look forward hopefully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spurs fans are also forking out for their frustrating campaign.

title=&quot;Weekly Football News&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Norwich gamble on Premier League future&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;English strugglers Norwich City have taken a massive gamble in the race for&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/premier-league&quot;&gt;Premier League&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;survival by dismissing manager&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/soccerphile/premier-league/chris-hughton.html&quot;&gt;Chris Hughton&lt;/a&gt; with only five matches of the 2013/14 season remaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hughton led the Canaries to 11th position in the top flight last season but fans have become increasingly restless in recent home matches, with some sections demanding the manager&#39;s sacking during their side&#39;s 1-0 home reverse to West Brom on Saturday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though Norwich are five points clear of the relegation zone in 17th place, they do face an uncomfortable run-in with games against 18th-placed side Fulham as well as champions-elect Liverpool, Manchester United, Chelsea and Arsenal. A Norwich statement said: &quot;The decision has been taken to give the club the maximum chance of survival.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Youth coach Neil Adams, who led Norwich to FA Youth Cup success against Chelsea last season, has been placed in temporary charge until the end of the season. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Arsenal&#39;s slump continues&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the other end of the table in England, Arsenal face potentially missing out on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/champions-league&quot;&gt;Champions League&lt;/a&gt; finishing position after their late-season slump continued with a 3-0 loss to resurgent Everton.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goals from Steven Naismith, Romelu Lukaku and an own goal by former Everton midfielder Mikel Arteta condemned Arsenal to another heavy defeat by a leading side following convincing losses to Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has led his side to 16 successive top-four finishes, but now admits that a place in next season&#39;s Champions League is under threat.  Fifth-placed Everton are point behind Arsenal with a game in hand, although they do still have to play Manchester City and Manchester United.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;It is a massive worry to lose a game like that. We need to go back to basics,&quot; bemoaned Wenger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;I wouldn&#39;t question the spirit of the team - they are focused and want to do well, they have just lost something on the confidence front. &quot;It is difficult to identify if it is fear. The heavy defeats away from home have taken some of our charisma away. Is that fear, is that belief, is that confidence? Maybe a bit all together.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bayern suffer shock league loss&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pep Guardiola has allowed having one eye on the return leg of the Champions League tie with Manchester United to deflect from league responsibilities, with Augsburg beating the new Bundesliga champions 1-0 on Saturday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guardiola fielded an experimental side ahead of Bayern&#39;s clash with the English champions on Wednesday, but his line-up failed their task, ending the Bavarians&#39; 53-match unbeaten league run in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;We tried everything until the end,&quot; Guardiola said. &quot;But we have to accept that in football you cannot always expect to win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Now we have to prepare quickly for our big game against Manchester.&quot; Manchester United also rested some key players but still managed to run out 4-0 winners over Newcastle. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maran humiliated by second sacking this season&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A fifth straight defeat for former Cantania manager Rolando Maran has led to the coach being sacked by the club for the second time this season. Maran was originally dismissed in October and replaced by Luigi De Canio, who he subsequently replaced in January.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, Cantania&#39;s seventh loss in the past eight games under the reinstated manager was enough to see him suffer the humiliation of parting company with the club for the second time in six months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maurizio Pellegrino, who managed the club in Serie C between 2001 and 2003, has been placed in charge. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Marc Fox&lt;/b&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/feeds/6087607192929278704/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7424337262078805962&amp;postID=6087607192929278704' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/6087607192929278704'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/6087607192929278704'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/04/weekly-football-news-april-7-2014.html' title='Weekly Football News April 7 2014'/><author><name>Soccerphile</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='6' src='http://bp3.blogger.com/_USzog_GOzyA/R-enhnyI37I/AAAAAAAADcs/gy7OPVaMJSY/S220/japan-visitor-logo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IzvmPjnogPM/Uu9gJFDovWI/AAAAAAAAfOk/zpwG42iEZRk/s72-c/weekly-news.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7424337262078805962.post-8369206596945624629</id><published>2014-04-04T11:45:00.004+01:00</published><updated>2014-04-11T11:58:19.214+01:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Betting"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="English Premier League"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="football betting"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Premier League"/><title type='text'>George&#39;s Premiership Predictions April 5 </title><content type='html'>&lt;a href=&quot;http://imstore.bet365affiliates.com/Tracker.aspx?AffiliateId=3771&amp;amp;AffiliateCode=365_027632&amp;amp;CID=358&amp;amp;PID=149&amp;amp;TID=3&amp;amp;LNG=1&amp;amp;DID=27&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;bet365&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://imstore.bet365affiliates.com/?AffiliateCode=365_027632&amp;amp;CID=358&amp;amp;PID=149&amp;amp;LNG=1&amp;amp;TID=3&amp;amp;DID=27&quot; title=&quot;bet365&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Of the three teams with a realistic chance of winning the Premier League, Manchester City play an in-form Southampton at home, Liverpool travel to east London to face West Ham, Chelsea play Stoke at Stamford Bridge hoping to put their poor display away to PSG in the Champions League.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saturday 5 April 2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Man City 3 v Southampton 1&lt;br /&gt;Aston Villa 2 v Fulham 1&lt;br /&gt;Cardiff 2 v Crystal Palace 1&lt;br /&gt;Hull 1 v Swansea 1&lt;br /&gt;Newcastle 0 v Man Utd 2&lt;br /&gt;Norwich 2 v West Brom 2&lt;br /&gt;Chelsea 1 v Stoke 0&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunday 6 April&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everton 1 v Arsenal 1&lt;br /&gt;West Ham 1 v Liverpool 1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Monday 7 April&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tottenham 1 v Sunderland 2&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soccer - Iniesta retains Barcelona belief &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barcelona midfield ace Andres Iniesta, whose side are 8/11 with bet365 to reach the last four, is confident that the Catalans will progress to the semi-finals of the Champions League. Barca have left themselves with work to do after being held to a 1-1 draw by Atletico Madrid in the Camp Nou, but Iniesta sees no reason to lose heart ahead of the Vicente Calderon return. He told UEFA.com: &quot;None of us has any doubts about our capacity to win there, any doubts about our style of play or about our team. &quot;That it will be difficult, we know, but we will go to Madrid with every confidence of making it through.&quot; Barca and Atletico are also currently locked in a three-way battle with Real Madrid for the La Liga title. Atleti lead the way by one point from Barca, with Real a further two points back, with the race set to go to the wire as Barcelona and Atletico meet on the final day of the season. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soccer - United to go on the attack &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manchester United, 6/1 with bet365 to reach the last four, will head to Germany looking for goals in the second leg of their Champions League quarter-final tie against Bayern Munich. The two sides shared a 1-1 draw at Old Trafford on Tuesday evening, leaving United knowing that they must find the net in the Allianz Arena on Wednesday 9th April to have any chance of making the semi-finals. Red Devils boss David Moyes promised: &quot;We will go toe-to-toe with them and we will try to come out on top. It is a tough tie, but we all believe we have got a chance. &quot;We need to score. We need to go there and attempt to win the game and get some goals.&quot; Four Champions League visits to Bayern have seen United secure two draws, while being beaten 2-1 on two occasions, the last of which came in March 2010 when Ivica Olic netted a last-minute winner for the hosts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/03/georges-premiership-predictions-march_29.html&quot;&gt;Last time&#39;s Premier League predictions&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/feeds/8369206596945624629/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7424337262078805962&amp;postID=8369206596945624629' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/8369206596945624629'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/8369206596945624629'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/04/georges-premiership-predictions-april-5.html' title='George&#39;s Premiership Predictions April 5 '/><author><name>Soccerphile</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='6' src='http://bp3.blogger.com/_USzog_GOzyA/R-enhnyI37I/AAAAAAAADcs/gy7OPVaMJSY/S220/japan-visitor-logo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7424337262078805962.post-1464141883506985588</id><published>2014-04-03T14:31:00.002+01:00</published><updated>2014-12-03T14:17:26.042Z</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="J-League"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Japan"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Japan soccer"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="JFL"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="K-League"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Thailand"/><title type='text'>Is the J-League Too Big?</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-j4cLGTvVnxA/Uuo9rg4RLgI/AAAAAAAAfN8/wGPtfVMUrzo/s1600/j-league.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;J-League Talent Production Line&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-j4cLGTvVnxA/Uuo9rg4RLgI/AAAAAAAAfN8/wGPtfVMUrzo/s1600/j-league.jpg&quot; title=&quot;J-League Talent Production Line&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The new &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/j-league&quot;&gt;J.League&lt;/a&gt; season kicked off recently with 18 teams all aspiring to hold aloft the J.League trophy come December.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that begs the question - is 18 teams too many?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who listen to the excellent &lt;a href=&quot;http://jtalkpodcast.blogspot.jp/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;JTalk Podcast&lt;/a&gt;, they would&#39;ve heard the animated Cesare Polenghi pose that very question in the final podcast last season. And it&#39;s a question that deserves serious consideration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As discussed in &lt;a href=&quot;http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/01/j-league-talent-production-line.html&quot;&gt;my previous column&lt;/a&gt;, the number of Japanese players moving to Europe is growing steadily every year. This cannot help but have an affect on the quality of the league. While there are young talents coming through, invariably they too are leaving for Europe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Japan has a seemingly endless production line of talent, it can only stretch so far. As the top tier of players head to Europe, those players who would ordinarily be squad players, or playing in J2, are having to step up to fill the void. That&#39;s not intended as a slight on their ability; it is just the raw fact of the matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/k-league&quot;&gt;K League Classic&lt;/a&gt; has undertaken a similar contraction in recent years, from 16 teams to 12 for that very reason - to increase the quality of the top tier as they introduced a new second division.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Thai Premier League will also undertake a contraction in coming years as they have come to realize the rapid growth in recent years hasn&#39;t necessarily been a good thing for the league.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly the J.League missed a golden opportunity to undertake a comprehensive review of its league structure with the introduction of J3 this season. With 18 teams in J1 and 22 in J2 the introduction of J3 was the perfect opportunity to cull some teams from both divisions, with those relegated from J2 forming the bulk of teams in J3, providing a stronger base for the division than promoting teams from the amateur JFL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the J.League see the introduction of J3 as the perfect vehicle to achieve their goal of a team in each of Japan&#39;s 47 prefectures, it could still have been achieved as J3 expanded in future years. Currently 36 prefectures have teams across the three divisions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to J1, however. What is the perfect number of teams? Is it 14? 16?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be hard to see four teams cut from J1, on face value it appears to be too drastic. But again, that is what the K League Classic has done recently (16 to 12). If you want to create the ultimate &#39;Premier League&#39; with the absolute best talent in Japan then 14 could possibly be the ideal number, ensuring that each club has a squad of relatively equal strength.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then what to do with the fixture? A 14-team league means only 26-rounds using the traditional home and away format. That is clearly not enough. It would require a solution similar to the K League Classic where after 26 games the season is split into two (top seven, bottom seven) with each team playing the other six teams in their group one more time in a Championship and Relegation Group, creating a 32-round season, two less than they currently play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On paper this could also satisfy the J.League&#39;s desire for a &#39;two-stage&#39; season to grow declining attendances, with the final six games of the season played between the best (and worst) teams ensuring a thrilling climax to the season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking at J2, a reduction from 22 to 18 teams would be the ideal situation. This allows for a simple 34-game home and away season, plus playoffs. With the added teams relegated from J1 (assuming a 14-team league), this means eight teams would have to have been relegated from J2 to create J3. Too much for one season, clearly, which is why with a little forward planning this could have been achieved over two seasons (two teams from J1 each season and four from J2 each season).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first season of relegation from J2, four new teams could have been added to J3 to ensure an eight-team league for its debut season, with the extra four relegated teams joining the following year to create a 12-team league.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alas, that opportunity has since passed, but the same forward planning can still be made to achieve the same result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The proposition wouldn&#39;t be popular, especially with the clubs most likely to face relegation from J1 and J2, but it would be in the best interests of the overall league structure and football in Japan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, what do you think? At 18-teams, is the J.League currently too big? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;© &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/soccerphile/columnists/paul-williams.html&quot;&gt;Paul Williams&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; Soccerphile&lt;/b&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/feeds/1464141883506985588/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7424337262078805962&amp;postID=1464141883506985588' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/1464141883506985588'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/1464141883506985588'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/04/is-j-league-too-big.html' title='Is the J-League Too Big?'/><author><name>Soccerphile</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='6' src='http://bp3.blogger.com/_USzog_GOzyA/R-enhnyI37I/AAAAAAAADcs/gy7OPVaMJSY/S220/japan-visitor-logo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-j4cLGTvVnxA/Uuo9rg4RLgI/AAAAAAAAfN8/wGPtfVMUrzo/s72-c/j-league.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7424337262078805962.post-542305224593260255</id><published>2014-03-29T09:17:00.000Z</published><updated>2014-04-04T11:30:02.850+01:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Betting"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="English Premier League"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="football betting"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="odds"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Predictions"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Premier League"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Premiership"/><title type='text'>George&#39;s Premiership Predictions March 29 2014</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href=&quot;http://imstore.bet365affiliates.com/Tracker.aspx?AffiliateId=3771&amp;amp;AffiliateCode=365_027632&amp;amp;CID=358&amp;amp;PID=149&amp;amp;TID=3&amp;amp;LNG=1&amp;amp;DID=27&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;bet365&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://imstore.bet365affiliates.com/?AffiliateCode=365_027632&amp;amp;CID=358&amp;amp;PID=149&amp;amp;LNG=1&amp;amp;TID=3&amp;amp;DID=27&quot; title=&quot;bet365&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Arsenal v Manchester City and Liverpool v Spurs are this week&#39;s big Premier League games as the season reaches its climax at top and bottom.

The Baggies have not kept a clean sheet in any of their last ten Premier League games and are just three points above the bottom three. Mel said: &quot;The way we&#39;re approaching the game is to be defensively strong. We&#39;ve been conceding some very early goals and that means we have to put a lot of effort in. &quot;We&#39;re very capable of creating scoring opportunities and we&#39;re convinced, if we don&#39;t concede, we&#39;ll be able to win the game.&quot; Albion are available at 11/8 with bet365 to keep a clean sheet on Saturday and can be backed at 13/2 to beat Cardiff 1-0. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soccer - Bruce fears the worst for McGregor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Allan McGregor&#39;s season appears to be over after the Hull City goalkeeper damaged a kidney in the 2-1 defeat at West Ham United. Tigers boss Steve Bruce has confirmed that the former Rangers shot-stopper is still in hospital after suffering the injury on Wednesday in a collision with Mohamed Diame - an incident which resulted in the Hammers being awarded a penalty and McGregor being sent off. Second-choice keeper Steve Harper is in line to start this weekend&#39;s match against Stoke City and Hull can be backed at 12/5 with bet365 to keep a clean sheet against the Potters. Shane Long is available at 3/1 to score at any time in the match. Bruce said: &quot;It certainly looks like he&#39;s going to miss the rest of the season. &quot;Allan is as brave as they come but he&#39;s taken a horrible knock to his kidneys and badly damaged one of them. We expect Allan to stay in hospital for at least another week.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/03/georges-premiership-predictions-march_21.html&quot;&gt;Last time&#39;s Premier League predictions&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/feeds/542305224593260255/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7424337262078805962&amp;postID=542305224593260255' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/542305224593260255'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/542305224593260255'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/03/georges-premiership-predictions-march_29.html' title='George&#39;s Premiership Predictions March 29 2014'/><author><name>Soccerphile</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='6' src='http://bp3.blogger.com/_USzog_GOzyA/R-enhnyI37I/AAAAAAAADcs/gy7OPVaMJSY/S220/japan-visitor-logo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7424337262078805962.post-2387802773340332564</id><published>2014-03-25T12:35:00.002Z</published><updated>2014-11-05T05:30:40.656Z</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Arsenal"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="barcelona"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Chelsea"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="clasico"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="English Premier League"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="La Liga"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Marc Fox"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="News"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Real Madrid"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Soccer News football"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="World Soccer News"/><title type='text'>Weekly Football News March 25 2014</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IzvmPjnogPM/Uu9gJFDovWI/AAAAAAAAfOk/zpwG42iEZRk/s1600/weekly-news.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Weekly Football News 3 February 2014&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IzvmPjnogPM/Uu9gJFDovWI/AAAAAAAAfOk/zpwG42iEZRk/s1600/weekly-news.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Weekly Football News 3 February 2014&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Clasico dual ends with Barca victory&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lionel Messi&#39;s brilliance sealed a thrilling 4-3 victory in the Clasico and ensured that Barcelona remain in the hunt to retain their La Liga title.&lt;br /&gt;In a match featuring three penalties - all scored - and the harsh sending off of Real defender Sergio Ramos, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/soccerphile/players/lionel-messi.html&quot;&gt;Messi&lt;/a&gt; scored a hat-trick and also provided the assist for Andres Iniesta&#39;s opener and a sublime pass for the penalty won by Neymar. &quot;La Liga is not over,&quot; Gerardo Martino said after watching his side close to within a point of title rivals Real and Atletico Madrid.&lt;br /&gt;&quot;We were given up for dead but with this result today we are right back in it. This was our last chance.

The teams will come up against one another in October in a competitive qualifier, but manager Gordon Strachan dismissed the suggestion that the 1-0 victory, courtesy of a Scott Brown goal, was a psychological advantage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;It meant absolutely nothing, because there will be changes,&quot; said Strachan. &quot;These two teams won&#39;t be the same.  But what it does, for the next couple of months, is give us confidence.&quot;  Scotland&#39;s next friendly is likely to be at Fulham&#39;s Craven Cottage in May, with Nigeria having invited Strachan&#39;s side to play them in London. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The win over Poland was Scotland&#39;s third successive away win, and they have gone five matches unbeaten, the past four without conceding a goal. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;That&#39;s good and it&#39;s not easy to do that,&quot; said Strachan, though, somewhat typically, he was not getting carried away with the improvements he has seen since taking over the helm from Craig Levein. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;It wasn&#39;t a great game. I don&#39;t think you could expect anything other than that at this time of the season in a friendly. It gave us a chance to have a look at them and vice versa, but we got some bonuses.&quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strachan also used the game to assess debutant Andrew Robertson.  The 19-year-old Dundee United left-back came on as a second-half substitute just a year to the day after playing for amateurs Queen&#39;s Park in a victory over Elgin City in Scotland&#39;s lowest tier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;I thought it didn&#39;t faze him and that adds to our squad. If he can keep up his performances then there&#39;s no reason why he shouldn&#39;t be in the next one,&quot; Strachan said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the manager reserved most praise for captain Brown, whose powerful finish from the edge of the box followed up his winner in the previous friendly in Norway. &quot;He has been fantastic,&quot; enthused the Scotland boss. &quot;We&#39;re looking to be more potent in attack. We need to work at that, that&#39;s for sure, but we&#39;re hopeful of having players over the next six months who will add to that.&quot;  .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;CELTIC&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Virgil van Dijk&#39;s agent has suggest that the Dutch defender is likely to head to the English Premierhip this summer, a move that may be prompted by the 22-year-old&#39;s failure to earn international recognition while in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.britain-visitor.com/uk-city-guides/glasgow-guide&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Glasgow&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The defender has been one of Celtic’s most consistent performers this season and there was some surprise when he was omitted from the Dutch provisional squad for this summer’s World Cup finals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;I&#39;m surprised because I think he&#39;s good enough to be in the provisional squad of 33,” said Neil Lennon, the Celtic manager. &quot;I don&#39;t know why he didn’t make it. You&#39;d have to ask the coach of Holland about that.&quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Van Dijk has been linked with Arsenal, Manchester City and Manchester United after impressing in his first season with Celtic, having joined from Groningen last summer.  &quot;He&#39;s played very well and been very consistent domestically and he was superb at the highest level in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/champions-league&quot;&gt;Champions League&lt;/a&gt;,&quot; said Lennon. &quot;He is only 22, so he&#39;s got a lot of scope to be even better.&quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Van Dijk was a replacement for Kelvin Wilson, who moved to Nottingham Forest, and Lennon admitted that the Dutchman had exceeded his expectations. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;We knew we had a good player having seen him and then looked at him in pre-season, but it&#39;s his temperament you don&#39;t know about beforehand - he&#39;s got a fantastic attitude to the game as well,&quot; said the manager. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Kelvin was an excellent player here and had a big bearing on the Champions League last year - he had some great games. We felt it might take a little time to replace him, but Virgil&#39;s been a very good fit.&quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lennon stressed that Van Dijk, who has represented his country at under-21 level, should not dwell on missing out on Dutch coach Louis van Gaal&#39;s initial squad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;He’s what you what you want in the modern-day centre-half.  He&#39;s big, he&#39;s got great timing in the air, tactically proficient with both feet, he&#39;s got good pace and reads the game very well.&quot;  Meanwhile, Lennon has admitted that the tantalising possibility of Celtic playing in England is one that he has given thought to. There is always an issue of Scottish clubs playing in the Premiership, but it is doubtful whether or not it will ever come to fruition. Lennon, though, has revealed his perfect future would be to manage Celtic south of the border.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;The ideal scenario for me would be to manage Celtic in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/premier-league&quot;&gt;Premier League&lt;/a&gt; but whether that will ever happen or not I don&#39;t know,&quot; said the Hoops boss. &quot;Maybe one day it will happen but at the minute we are content to keep going as we are.&quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“There are always moves behind the scenes but there are always buffers in the way. It&#39;s just a nice thought. We all harbour ambitions to better ourselves and I&#39;m no different from anyone else but I&#39;ve got a big job on my hands at the minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;European football and winning championships is the driving force behind us. Can we get to play in what would be perceived to be a better environment for the club?  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;RANGERS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ibrox boss Ally McCoist has once again found himself shying away from public queries about the financial state of Rangers.  Yet another war of words has broken out between former director Dave King and the current Rangers board over the financial running of the beleaguered Glasgow club.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;King called on Rangers fans not to renew their season tickets, a move which irked chairman David Somers, who accused the prospective investor of &amp;nbsp;&#39;attempting to destabilise the club&#39;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The South Africa-based businessman has now agreed to meet Somers, and other members of the Rangers board, but when asked how he felt the showdown talks would go, McCoist was reluctant to voice a public opinion.  &quot;I don&#39;t have to pay attention to that,&quot; he said. &quot;What I pay attention to at the moment is the football team,&quot; he said. &quot;Matches, games, results... that&#39;s my job as a football manager. &quot;Everything else will look after itself. I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s secondary but everything else will look after itself. Our boys have been doing particularly well in terms of results.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When pushed on the imminent arrival of King in Scotland, he replied: &quot;I think Dave King said &#39;Ally McCoist was doing the right thing by actually talking about the football&#39;. &quot;So is the chief executive and the board. So if all parties are quite happy with me talking about the football, which indeed I am, I think I will continue to talk about the football. &quot;The last two years have been what they&#39;ve been. I don&#39;t get frustrated, I just have a job to do.&quot;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/feeds/6044277865626769418/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7424337262078805962&amp;postID=6044277865626769418' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/6044277865626769418'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/6044277865626769418'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/03/scottish-premier-league-news-march-2014.html' title='Scottish Premier League News March 2014'/><author><name>Soccerphile</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='6' src='http://bp3.blogger.com/_USzog_GOzyA/R-enhnyI37I/AAAAAAAADcs/gy7OPVaMJSY/S220/japan-visitor-logo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-P8u_k0m0To8/UrQi0pu5SeI/AAAAAAAAe9o/68TW-3z9mfk/s72-c/spl1.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7424337262078805962.post-8226712041184019972</id><published>2014-03-21T10:29:00.002Z</published><updated>2014-03-29T08:56:27.818Z</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Betting"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="English Premier League"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="football betting"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Premier League"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Premiership"/><title type='text'>George&#39;s Premiership Predictions March 22 2014</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href=&quot;http://imstore.bet365affiliates.com/Tracker.aspx?AffiliateId=3771&amp;amp;AffiliateCode=365_027632&amp;amp;CID=358&amp;amp;PID=149&amp;amp;TID=3&amp;amp;LNG=1&amp;amp;DID=27&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;bet365&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://imstore.bet365affiliates.com/?AffiliateCode=365_027632&amp;amp;CID=358&amp;amp;PID=149&amp;amp;LNG=1&amp;amp;TID=3&amp;amp;DID=27&quot; title=&quot;bet365&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Chelsea v Arsenal is this week&#39;s big Premier League.

United came from two goals down to record a 3-2 aggregate success over Olympiacos in the last-16 and now await the quarter-final draw, where Moyes&#39; men stand alongside Chelsea, Bayern Munich, Barcelona, Real Madrid, Borussia Dortmund, Paris St-Germain and Atletico Madrid. And, although Moyes accepts that his team are not highly fancied to be crowned European champions, he thinks that United could yet surprise a few people. &quot;We will probably go into the quarter-final tie as underdogs, but I don&#39;t see why not (we can&#39;t win the trophy),&quot; Moyes told reporters. &quot;This football club is capable of it. If we play to our capabilities, which we&#39;ve not shown that often this season, I think we can be a match for any team.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clichy issues silverware warning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manchester City left-back Gael Clichy has warned his team-mates that they need to win the Premier League to make this season a success. The Citizens have already secured the Capital One Cup, but France international Clichy says that his club need to add to that trophy to be able to look back on the campaign with pride. He warned: &quot;The Capital One Cup won&#39;t be enough. It&#39;s crunch time and we have to get the points until the end of the season. &quot;Basically, if we win all the games we are going to be champions. It&#39;s easy to say, but not easy to do, but we&#39;re going to try really hard to make this happen.&quot; The Citizens, who are 13/10 with bet365 to be crowned champions, are currently fourth in the table, six points behind leaders Chelsea with three games in hand. City host Fulham on Saturday, having won each of their last four meetings with the Londoners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/03/georges-premiership-predictions-march.html&quot;&gt;Last time&#39;s Premier League predictions&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/feeds/8226712041184019972/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7424337262078805962&amp;postID=8226712041184019972' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/8226712041184019972'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/8226712041184019972'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/03/georges-premiership-predictions-march_21.html' title='George&#39;s Premiership Predictions March 22 2014'/><author><name>Soccerphile</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='6' src='http://bp3.blogger.com/_USzog_GOzyA/R-enhnyI37I/AAAAAAAADcs/gy7OPVaMJSY/S220/japan-visitor-logo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7424337262078805962.post-223980962878912787</id><published>2014-03-15T05:19:00.003Z</published><updated>2014-11-24T16:56:57.942Z</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Betting"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="English Football"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="English Premier League"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="football betting"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Predictions"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Premier League"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Premiership"/><title type='text'>George&#39;s Premiership Predictions March 15 2014</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href=&quot;http://imstore.bet365affiliates.com/Tracker.aspx?AffiliateId=3771&amp;amp;AffiliateCode=365_027632&amp;amp;CID=358&amp;amp;PID=149&amp;amp;TID=3&amp;amp;LNG=1&amp;amp;DID=27&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;bet365&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://imstore.bet365affiliates.com/?AffiliateCode=365_027632&amp;amp;CID=358&amp;amp;PID=149&amp;amp;LNG=1&amp;amp;TID=3&amp;amp;DID=27&quot; title=&quot;bet365&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;George has predictions for this week&#39;s Premier League with some important games over the weekend including the north London derby and Manchester United at home to arch-rivals Liverpool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saturday 15 March 2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hull City 1 v Man City 1&lt;br /&gt;Sunderland 1 v Crystal Palace 0&lt;br /&gt;Stoke City 1 v West Ham 0&lt;br /&gt;Southampton 2 v Norwich City 0 &lt;br /&gt;Fulham 2 v Newcastle 1&lt;br /&gt;Swansea City 2 v West Brom 0 &lt;br /&gt;Everton 2 v Cardiff City 1&lt;br /&gt;Aston Villa 0 v Chelsea 2&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunday 16 March&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Man United 2 v Liverpool 1&lt;br /&gt;Tottenham 1 v Arsenal 2&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soccer - Fernandes keeps faith with under-fire Redknapp&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;QPR chairman Tony Fernandes has backed Harry Redknapp to eventually guide the club back to the Premier League. After a run of just one win in their last seven Championship matches, QPR are ten points adrift of an automatic promotion spot and are 9/4 with bet365 to be promoted this season. Some fans have called for Redknapp to be axed, but Fernandes has issued the veteran manager a vote of confidence. He tweeted: &quot;Nothing wrong with Harry. Team playing hard. Some defensive lapses. Need to tighten up. And of course score goals. Playing much better. &quot;Takes time to rebuild. May take years to get it right. There was little to build on. Give support to team.&quot; QPR face Yeovil Town this weekend and can be backed at 15/2 to win the match 2-1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soccer - Van Persie insists he&#39;s happy at Old Trafford&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manchester United striker Robin van Persie has hit back at his critics who have suggested he is angling for a move away from Old Trafford by insisting he is happy to stay at the club. The Netherlands international is adamant that he has not fallen out with United boss &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/home/david-moyes&quot;&gt;David Moyes&lt;/a&gt; and says he would be willing to extend his contract. Despite struggling with a succession of niggling injuries this term, the 30-year-old former Arsenal star has scored 14 goals in 23 appearances, and said: &quot;The truth is I&#39;m very happy here at this club. I signed for four years and I&#39;d be delighted to stay even longer, beyond the next two years I have left on my contract. &quot;This is how I feel, although it&#39;s not what has been suggested in the media.&quot; United entertain Liverpool on Sunday and can be backed at 9/1 with bet365 to beat Brendan Rodgers&#39; title-chasing side 2-1, with Van Persie available at 9/2 to open the scoring at Old Trafford.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/03/georges-premiership-predictions-march-8.html&quot;&gt;Last time&#39;s Premier League predictions&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/feeds/223980962878912787/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7424337262078805962&amp;postID=223980962878912787' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/223980962878912787'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/223980962878912787'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/03/georges-premiership-predictions-march.html' title='George&#39;s Premiership Predictions March 15 2014'/><author><name>Soccerphile</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='6' src='http://bp3.blogger.com/_USzog_GOzyA/R-enhnyI37I/AAAAAAAADcs/gy7OPVaMJSY/S220/japan-visitor-logo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7424337262078805962.post-4916361880285558678</id><published>2014-03-14T02:33:00.001Z</published><updated>2014-11-05T07:16:52.872Z</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Arsenal"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Atletico Madrid"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Bayern Munich"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Italy"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="milan"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Sean O&#39;Conor"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Spain"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="UEFA Champions League"/><title type='text'>England &amp; Italy victims of Europe&#39;s New Wave</title><content type='html'>The second round of the UEFA Champions League is only a quarter done but once again it looks like it will be glory to the Germans and Spanish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Atletico Madrid and Barcelona are already in the last eight, with Real Madrid sure to join them. Borussia Dortmund should join Bayern and Paris Saint-Germain, leaving Chelsea or Galatasaray (1:1 from the first leg) and Manchester United or Olympiakos (0:2) to scrap for the final two places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The top two nations in FIFA&#39;s World Rankings are also dominating their continent&#39;s top club competition.&lt;br /&gt;Reigning champions Bayern Munich cruised past Arsenal 3-1 on aggregate with a superiority so embarrassing it made for painful viewing in England.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a coach so number-crunching as Arsene Wenger, the raw statistics of the 1-1 tie at the Allianz Arena must have felt like daggers to his heart:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starting two goals down from the first leg at Ashburton Grove, in the second leg, Arsenal made 433 passes to Bayern&#39;s 791, with a completion rate of 67% against the Germans&#39; 81%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gunners&#39; most prolific passer was Bacary Sagna, with 36, yet Bayern&#39;s top translator was Thiago Alcantara with 89. Arsenal struggled to leave their half or string passes together in the face of Bayern&#39;s ferocious &#39;gegenpressing&#39;, a Germanic take on Barcelona&#39;s closing-down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Pep Guardiola cutting a sartorial dash on the touchline and Thiago buzzing, it was as if the blaugrana had upped sticks to Bavaria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only Gunner who came away with credit was goalkeeper Lukas Fabianski, who saved a penalty from Thomas Muller, and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, whose mazy runs provided some threat and have surely stamped his England ticket to Brazil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barça themselves comfortably sank another English warship the following night, defeating moneybags Manchester City 4-1 over two legs. This leaves Chelsea, who drew 1-1 away to Galatasaray, and Manchester United, who lost 2-0 at Olimpiakos in their first legs, clutching the battered Premier League flag amid the German-Spanish cavalcade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Man United are still suffering from the inevitable post-Fergie hangover, yet one should not underestimate any side under the tutelage of Jose Mourinho.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone still absurdly crowing about how good the Premier League is can at least cry on the shoulders of Italians, who have also been wailing and blaming after the ageing legs of Milan, their last CL representative, surrendered 5-1 on aggregate to the ebullient Atletico Madrid, conceding four at the Vicente Calderon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this match, the stats interestingly favoured the thrashed: Milan won 56% of possession and made 507 successful passes against Atletico&#39;s 391, yet lost 4-1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11 Milanese shots, 5 of which were on target, versus Atletico&#39;s 7 accurate shots out of 13 do not portray such a one-sided scoreline, and nor does the fact Milan made more runs in the attacking third and into the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roy Hodgson was perhaps right when he said he did not hold much stock in the stats but concentrated on who creates the more goalscoring chances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet the figures comparing Mario Balotelli and Diego Costa are consistent with their performances. The Brazilian-born Costa, who made his debut for his adoptive Spain last week, ran ten kilometres against Balotelli&#39;s eight, made 35 passes against 22, combined seven times with teammates versus Balotelli&#39;s none and shot three times against Balotelli&#39;s once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Costa was full of energy and explosive, leaping to connect with the end of his shoe to open the scoring before he added another goal; Balotelli on the other hand had one of his stinkers, trudging around moodily and unmotivated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In their make-or-break clash, Milan started only one goal behind but Kaka apart, were never at the races. Their lethargic and error-strewn midfield trio of Michael Essien, Nigel de Jong and Andrea Poli were eclipsed by the mobile and fiery Mario Suarez, Gabi and Koke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;We are sad and disappointed,&quot; manager Clarence Seedorf indeed confirmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The post-mortems have switched to the general malaise in Italian football on and off the field - the bent owners and officials, the hooligans and the now shabby-looking stadia, which in Italia &#39;90 had dazzled the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unthinkable as it might have been a few years back, Italians are worried that Portugal will overtake them in the UEFA coefficients and they will receive fewer European places in future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Serie A&#39;s death has long been exaggerated it must be said, despite the latest bad news. Italian clubs might have missed out on the Champions League quarter-finals four times in the 21st Century but in the same spell have also won the cup three times, as many times as England and more than Germany. The Azzurri also won the 2006 World Cup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The municipally-owned stadia are a problem however, and compare unfavourably with those in Germany and England. Even the relatively new Juventus arena rakes in half the money the similarly-sized Stamford Bridge does. The persistence of hundreds of militaristic and often racist ultras in the &#39;curva&#39; does not help win sponsors either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big name players tend to pick Spain, England or Bayern Munich now instead of Serie A having first bite at the cherry. And ambitious owners favour higher-profile leagues than Italy&#39;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The international clamour to control Premier League clubs shows no signs of abating, and top English teams, on the back of the latest bumper TV deal, can, unlike Serie A, look forward to more huge cash injections for the foreseeable future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This financial advantage means there are five English clubs and only two Italian in Deloitte&#39;s latest top ten list of wealthy teams. Even Inter have slipped to twelfth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Germany and Spain dominate on the field for now, English teams will be splashing the cash to fight back to their perch a decade or so ago when three out of the four semi-finalists were from the Premier League (2005) or both of the finalists (2008).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Italian clubs however, a return to their glory days still looks far away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(c) Sean O&#39;Conor &amp;amp; Soccerphile&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Themes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;World Soccer&amp;nbsp;football</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/feeds/4916361880285558678/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7424337262078805962&amp;postID=4916361880285558678' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/4916361880285558678'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/4916361880285558678'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/03/england-italy-victims-of-europes-new.html' title='England &amp; Italy victims of Europe&#39;s New Wave'/><author><name>Sean O&#39;Conor</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='33' height='20' src='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_alcLfIha2wA/SfGD9nB7_6I/AAAAAAAAA9w/hefDCUsPw00/S220/puma.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7424337262078805962.post-6179621055504038782</id><published>2014-03-13T10:54:00.000Z</published><updated>2014-11-05T07:17:04.379Z</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2014 World Cup"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="England National Team"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Fifa World Rankings"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="world rankings"/><title type='text'>Fifa World Rankings March 2014</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pYYDc0SabEw/UbByb2DLTDI/AAAAAAAAdn8/TonfgSojRhQ/s1600/fifa-rankings2.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;FIFA World Fifa Rankings&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pYYDc0SabEw/UbByb2DLTDI/AAAAAAAAdn8/TonfgSojRhQ/s200/fifa-rankings2.jpg&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; title=&quot;FIFA World Fifa Rankings&quot; width=&quot;177&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Fifa&#39;s World Rankings for March 2013 were published today at FIFA HQ in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/soccerphile/euro2008/city_guide/zurich.html&quot;&gt;Zurich&lt;/a&gt;, Switzerland.

title=&quot;World Cup 2014&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/world-cup-2014&quot;&gt;2014 World Cup&lt;/a&gt; of soccer is fast approaching, and fans of the 32 involved nations are getting more and more excited with each passing day for their prospects of glory in Brazil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But while the majority of tournament favorites come from the continent of Europe, I can almost guarantee you that the World Cup winner will not be a European nation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps that comes across as a mighty bold statement considering the prowess of international superpowers like Germany, Spain, France, and Italy, but there is an unfortunate fact in football that will doom these teams.  The problem is the location of Brazil for the World Cup.  Here is the fact:  Only one European team has ever won a World Cup outside of Europe!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That team was Spain, which won the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/world-cup-2010&quot;&gt;2010 World Cup in South Africa&lt;/a&gt;.  While that achievement does give hope for the European teams headed for Brazil, it really should not.  For one thing, the home teams are generally boosted by their friendly surroundings at international sporting competitions.  Just like Russia recently dominated the medal count at the Sochi Olympics, so will Brazil likely stroll to a World Cup title.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the surrounding nations like Uruguay and Argentina should also figure to dominate at this event, potentially even pulling off a victory themselves.  Meanwhile, at the African World Cup of 2010, the African teams were boosted, but I doubt anyone had expected one of them to actually win.  They are simply unable to compete against many of the world&#39;s best.  However, Ghana did manage to reach the quarterfinals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason that Spain proved to be an anomaly was that their team was freakishly talented beyond all others.  They simply dominated possession in every game forcing opponents to scramble keeping up.  While they will still carry many of the same players of that triumph, they will be without a vital piece of their former squad: Carlos Puyol.  The often-barbaric central defender was crucial to the success of Spain and often sucked the life out of their opponents.  He was also a hero after scoring a powerful header to lead Spain to victory over Germany in the semifinals.  Without Puyol in the side, expect Spain to not be quite as strong.  And as evidenced by their 3-0 thrashing at the hands of Brazil in the 2013 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/soccerphile/confederations-cup/&quot;&gt;Confederation Cup&lt;/a&gt; Final, I doubt the Spanish will be able to contend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But why have World Cup victories proved so difficult for countries to earn outside of their respective continents?  There are actually a ton of reasons.  For one, fan support is limited.  While World Cups do make for wonderful traveling opportunities, it is will be both costly and possibly dangerous for foreigners to make the trek out to Brazil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will be definite security threats throughout the tournament and most fans simply cannot afford trans-Atlantic plane flights, World Cup tickets, and all the additional costs of hotel arrangements and pricey dinners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In essence, every European match (especially those against South American teams) will be an away game.  As we see time and time again in club soccer throughout the world, winning an away match can be mighty tricky.  The same effect is reversed for home teams.  With their fans at their backs, they often rise above the odds and push forward to win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus, the South American teams at the World Cup will be blessed with home support throughout the tournament.  With some of the rowdiest known fans on the planet, expect these sides to work magic and win most of the games.  For everyone else?  The going will be tough.  In fact, the only nation other than Spain to even win a World Cup outside of their home continent has been Brazil.  And now they will be the host nation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another factor that will come into play is the time zone difference.  For the European nations, they will have to play matches on an average of 4 hours later.  While teams will attempt to counter this by arriving early and settling into the new surroundings, there’s no doubt that they will struggle to adapt to the new time zones.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A whole other issue resides in the weather in Brazil.  This is literally a nation through which the equator of the world runs.  It will be hot.  It will be humid.  And as we will soon see, European players, most of whom are not used to playing in temperatures above 60 degrees (and often play in far colder weather) will probably suffer in these conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps it won’t be too much of an issue in earlier games, but as the tournament wears on towards the final, some of these European stars will certainly be feeling the heat and get fatigued!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And lastly, I expect Europe to fail as a whole at this World Cup because of the players.  Sure, there are many wonderful European soccer stars, but South America is home to some potential soccer legends, and they have the supporting casts to back them up.  For Brazil, it is all about Neymar, the sensational 22-year-old striker who has already scored 30 goals for his country.  His task will be made easier with the likes of Oscar, David Luiz, Dani Alves, Hulk, and Thiago Silva.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Argentina, the talk is all about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/soccerphile/players/lionel-messi.html&quot;&gt;Lionel Messi&lt;/a&gt;, and his quest will be aided by the likes of Sergio Aguero, Pablo Zabaleta, Javier Mascherano, and Angel di Maria.  Or take a look at Uruguay, led by superstar striker Luis Suarez and a supporting cast of Edinson Cavani, Diego Forlan, Christian Rodriguez, and Diego Lugano.  These guys are the ones that could win a World Cup.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elsewhere, there may be some star players, but the supporting cast isn’t quite up to par.  Sure Robin van Persie and Arjen Robben could make a claim for the Netherlands, but their back line will be a major area of concern.  Yes, Cristiano Ronaldo is an incredible player, but who else on Portugal will get him the ball?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mario Balotelli will carry the burden of Italy on his shoulders, but who else on that team can really support him?  And yes, France and Germany both have great squads, but are any one of their players actually world-class superstars?  By the players alone, South America will dominate this World Cup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so while the 2014 World Cup beckons warmly for all soccer fans and their visions of success, I think there are many reasons to keep a level head and not expect a European winner this time around.  Sure, there will be enthralling matches, and a team like Germany could potentially reach the final, but make no mistake about it, a South American team (probably Brazil) is going to walk away as World Cup Champions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;© Nicholas Spiller &amp;amp; Soccerphile.com&lt;/b&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/feeds/2231345635431384388/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7424337262078805962&amp;postID=2231345635431384388' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/2231345635431384388'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/2231345635431384388'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/03/despite-featuring-many-top-teams-expect.html' title='Despite Featuring Many Top Teams Expect European Nations to Struggle at 2014 World Cup'/><author><name>Soccerphile</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='6' src='http://bp3.blogger.com/_USzog_GOzyA/R-enhnyI37I/AAAAAAAADcs/gy7OPVaMJSY/S220/japan-visitor-logo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JIbffVc5hCo/UyBPPWfUvTI/AAAAAAAAffY/dXd6xhClrnE/s72-c/world-cup-2014.gif" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7424337262078805962.post-8835322240594217344</id><published>2014-03-11T13:43:00.000Z</published><updated>2014-12-10T15:59:44.690Z</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="FC Seoul"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Gyeongnam FC"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Hong Myong-bo"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Incheon United"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Jeju United"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Jeonbuk Motors"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="K-League"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Park Chu-young"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Pohang Steelers"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Seongnam Ilhwa Chunma"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Son Heung-min"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Suwon Samsung Bluewings"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Ulsan Horang-i"/><title type='text'>Revenge served cold on Pohang</title><content type='html'>&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eh2hHqtAhe8/VIhlhYm8p5I/AAAAAAAAik0/ZWkX7VzFGtU/s1600/classic-logo.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;K-League news.&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eh2hHqtAhe8/VIhlhYm8p5I/AAAAAAAAik0/ZWkX7VzFGtU/s1600/classic-logo.png&quot; title=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;It has been a low-key start to the 2014 K-League season. Blame the Winter Olympics and the controversy surrounding Queen Yu-na Kim being awarded the silver medal to a local Russian skater despite most thinking she deserved to win. And then there was a big national team game away in Greece and then the 32nd campaign of Asia’s oldest professional league got underway.  It started as the 2013 campaign finished with a late goal settling affairs between Pohang Steelers and Ulsan Horangi. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Readers will remember (how could they forget?) how Pohang scored in the last minute of the final game at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.japanvisitor.com/korea/korea-city-guide/city-guide-ulsan&quot;&gt;Ulsan&lt;/a&gt; to take the title from their despondent hosts who had been five points clear with two games remaining.   That day, Kim Shin-wook was suspended and went pitchside to celebrate for the final seconds only to arrive just as the Pohang end of the stadium was going crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three months on, he scored the only goal of the game to give the Tigers a winning start. It was a deserved win. Fans at the Steelyard, still celebrating their unlikely title win, got a reminder that Pohang may not be out in front this season after not strengthening, perhaps even becoming weaker over the winter.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FC Seoul fans know the feeling. Despite a classy win over Central Coast Mariners in the opening round of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/home/asian-football-confederation-asian-champions-league&quot;&gt;Asian Champions League&lt;/a&gt; at the end of February, the club got a glimpse of life with stars &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/soccerphile/news/korean-soccer/dejan-damjanovic.html&quot;&gt;Dejan Damjanovic&lt;/a&gt; and Ha Dae-sung, who moved to China at the start of the year. Seoul, who were beaten finalists in the 2013 Asian Champions League, lost 1-0 at home to Chunnam. Seoul habitually are slow starters and don’t have the best of records against the Dragons, one of the league’s smaller side, but the performance was as tame as white kimchi.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jeonbuk Motors have moved into gear with ominous ease. The club has signed a number of players over the close season such as Han Kyo-won and 2002 star Kim Nam-il from Incheon as Brazilian duo Marcos Aurelio and Kaio. The club has decent strength in depth and when it talks of challenging for the K-League and the Asian Champions League, it has the talent to do so and was proved when the Jeonju club scored three great goals to sweep aside Busan I’Park on the opening day, just ten days after defeating Yokohama F Marinos by the same 3-0 scoreline.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suwon Bluewings were the other big power to get off to a win, albeit a lucky 1-0 victory at jeju United thanks to a Lee Yong own goal. The Gyeonggi giants are looking to put a disappointing 2013 behind them and while three points won’t do that, they will help. Jeju, who signed a huge amount of players over the past few months, will need time to settle. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elsewhere, military team Sangju Sangmi are back in the top flight and played out an entertaining 2-2 draw with Incheon United while the new Seongnam FC lost 1-0 to a late Luke Devere goal.  &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Park Chu-young reborn&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took just 12 minutes for the Arsenal striker to announce his return to the international stage as he thrashed a half-volley into the Greek net in Athens. Now on loan at Watford in the English championship, Park showed few signs of rust after his recent inaction and helped Korea to a fine 2-0 win the capital of the team ranked 12 in the world.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Son Heung-min grabbed the second in the second half, an equally sumptuous strike that almost tore the roof off the net. After some indifferent performances by the team in January against Costa Rica, Mexico and the United States, going forward Korea looked excellent at times. At the back, it wasn’t quite as impressive.  But under coach Hong Myong-bo, who took the job just eight months ago, the team is moving in the right direction. Or so it seems. &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;So far in Asia, so good.&lt;/b&gt; Six games in and two draws and four wins. The K-League has a good record in Asia and while there is still some way to go in 2014, the start has been good. Especially impressive was Jeonbuk’s 3-0 defeat of Yokohama F. Marinos, even if the scoreline was slightly flattering, and Ulsan’s come from behind 3-1 win down under at the home of Western Sydney Wanderers.&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/feeds/8835322240594217344/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7424337262078805962&amp;postID=8835322240594217344' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/8835322240594217344'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/8835322240594217344'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/03/revenge-served-cold-on-pohang.html' title='Revenge served cold on Pohang'/><author><name>John Duerden</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/18030826434552320752</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eh2hHqtAhe8/VIhlhYm8p5I/AAAAAAAAik0/ZWkX7VzFGtU/s72-c/classic-logo.png" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7424337262078805962.post-8146658896753322645</id><published>2014-03-11T08:36:00.000Z</published><updated>2014-11-22T02:59:48.770Z</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="A-League"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Brisbane"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Bundesliga"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Cardiff"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Felix Magath"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Fulham"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Hull City"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Manchester City"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Marc Fox"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Sheffield United"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="werder"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Wigan"/><title type='text'>Weekly Football News March 11 2014</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IzvmPjnogPM/Uu9gJFDovWI/AAAAAAAAfOk/zpwG42iEZRk/s1600/weekly-news.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Weekly Football News 3 February 2014&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IzvmPjnogPM/Uu9gJFDovWI/AAAAAAAAfOk/zpwG42iEZRk/s1600/weekly-news.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Weekly Football News 3 February 2014&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wigan in dreamland - again&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2013/05/wigan-athletic.html&quot;&gt;Wigan Athletic&lt;/a&gt; have been rewarded for knocking high-flying Manchester City out of the FA Cup with a second trip to Wembley within 12 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The FA Cup holders repeated their feat of overcoming City in last season&#39;s final at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://devonvisitor.blogspot.com/2012/05/etihad-stadium-sport-city-manchester.html&quot;&gt;Etihad Stadium&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday, despite the fact that the club has been relegated from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/premier-league&quot;&gt;Premier League&lt;/a&gt; and seen their inspirational manager Roberto Martinez depart for Everton in the meantime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wigan&#39;s route to the semi-final has also included notable wins over Premier League sides Crystal Palace and Cardiff City and they now face Arsenal in their semi-final tie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the other semi-final, League One side Sheffield United will play Hull City. &quot;To win - and the way we won - is my biggest achievement as a football manager,&quot; Wigan manager Uwe Rosler said. &quot;We did not do it just by parking the bus and being lucky.

The 27-year-old Werder Bremen captain told referee Manuel Graefe to reverse his 75th-minute decision to award Werder a penalty, after Nuremberg&#39;s defender Javier Pinola had appeared to bring down Hunt in the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Out of instinct, I wanted to provoke the penalty, but that was wrong,&quot; Hunt told Sky Sports. &quot;I struggled with myself a bit (to say something), but we don&#39;t want to win any games like that, even if we are in a relegation battle.&quot; Bremen went on to win 2-0.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fulham&#39;s chances are diminishing: Magath&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fulham manager Felix Magath has admitted that his side&#39;s Premier League status is hanging by a thread after their 3-1 defeat by fellow cellar dwellers Cardiff City. Magath, Fulham&#39;s third manager of a turbulent season, boldly predicted that he would turn around the side&#39;s fortunes on his arrival last month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, he has been forced to concede that Fulham might slip into the Championship after watching his team humbled by out-of-form Cardiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Our chances are worse than before (to stay up),&quot; said the former Bayern Munich manager. &quot;We have to win our home games, that is the most important thing. The next game is a home game against &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.britain-visitor.com/uk-city-guides/newcastle-guide&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Newcastle&lt;/a&gt; and we need three points.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fulham are now three points behind second-from bottom Sunderland, who have three matches in hand. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Roar power on in Australia&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/roar-title-tarnished-by-grand-final-controversy&quot;&gt;Brisbane Roar&lt;/a&gt; are virtually assured of securing the Premier&#39;s Plate in Australia after moving 10 points clear at the top of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/a-league&quot;&gt;A-League&lt;/a&gt; table following a 2-1 win over Adelaide United. With five rounds of the regular season remaining, the premiership and a berth in next year&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soccerphile.com/asian-champions-league&quot;&gt;AFC Champions League&lt;/a&gt; are seemingly assured for the 2010/11 and 2011/12 champions. Star striker Besart Berisha scored both goals to secure Brisbane&#39;s 14th win of the season. &quot;Five games to go, plus finals, winning at home - it&#39;s a good habit to get into,&quot; coach Mike Mulvey said afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Marc Fox&lt;/b&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/feeds/8146658896753322645/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7424337262078805962&amp;postID=8146658896753322645' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/8146658896753322645'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/8146658896753322645'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/03/weekly-football-news-march-11-2014.html' title='Weekly Football News March 11 2014'/><author><name>Soccerphile</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='6' src='http://bp3.blogger.com/_USzog_GOzyA/R-enhnyI37I/AAAAAAAADcs/gy7OPVaMJSY/S220/japan-visitor-logo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IzvmPjnogPM/Uu9gJFDovWI/AAAAAAAAfOk/zpwG42iEZRk/s72-c/weekly-news.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7424337262078805962.post-8085898072674913382</id><published>2014-03-08T03:41:00.000Z</published><updated>2014-03-15T05:13:23.234Z</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Betting"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="English Premier League"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="FA Cup"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="football betting"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="prediction"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Predictions"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Premiership"/><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Sports Betting"/><title type='text'>George&#39;s Premiership Predictions March 8 2014</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href=&quot;http://imstore.bet365affiliates.com/Tracker.aspx?AffiliateId=3771&amp;amp;AffiliateCode=365_027632&amp;amp;CID=358&amp;amp;PID=149&amp;amp;TID=3&amp;amp;LNG=1&amp;amp;DID=27&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;bet365&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://imstore.bet365affiliates.com/?AffiliateCode=365_027632&amp;amp;CID=358&amp;amp;PID=149&amp;amp;LNG=1&amp;amp;TID=3&amp;amp;DID=27&quot; title=&quot;bet365&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;George has predictions for both the Premier League and the FA Cup this weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manchester City face Wigan Athletic in a repeat of last year&#39;s FA Cup Final in May, a game won by the Latics.

The 27-year-old could miss the FA Cup quarter-final against Wigan Athletic because of the injury, which he has been nursing for the last few weeks. Dzeko had originally agreed to play only 45 minutes of the friendly but was forced to labour for the full 90 minutes in Innsbruck. He wrote on his Facebook page: &quot;I came here with a niggling injury and Susic knew that, and he still didn&#39;t substitute me at half time, which was the plan, or after the break when I asked to be replaced. &quot;I don&#39;t know why he left me on the pitch for the full 90 minutes.&quot; City can be backed at 15/2 with bet365 to beat the Latics 2-1 while Uwe Rosler&#39;s side are available at 4/1 to be promoted from the Championship this season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soccer - Magath convinced Fulham will stay up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Felix Magath is adamant that his Fulham side will not be relegated this season even though they are four points away from safety with only ten games remaining. Magath, who was installed as the Cottagers&#39; third manager of the campaign last month, remains optimistic even though he will be without Damien Duff and Scott Parker for the crunch clash with Cardiff City. He said: &quot;I&#39;m convinced that we will avoid relegation because we&#39;ve developed in the last 14 days. &quot;The team is growing together and that is what makes me sure that we can avoid relegation.&quot; Fulham, 2/9 with bet365 to be relegated this season, are available at 10/1 to beat Cardiff City 1-0.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/02/georges-premiership-predictions-1-march.html&quot;&gt;Last time&#39;s Premier League predictions&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/feeds/8085898072674913382/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7424337262078805962&amp;postID=8085898072674913382' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/8085898072674913382'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7424337262078805962/posts/default/8085898072674913382'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://soccerphile.blogspot.com/2014/03/georges-premiership-predictions-march-8.html' title='George&#39;s Premiership Predictions March 8 2014'/><author><name>Soccerphile</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='31' height='6' src='http://bp3.blogger.com/_USzog_GOzyA/R-enhnyI37I/AAAAAAAADcs/gy7OPVaMJSY/S220/japan-visitor-logo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry></feed>
