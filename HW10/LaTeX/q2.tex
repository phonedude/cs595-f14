\section{Question 2}

\subsection{The Question}

\begin{flushleft}

Manually classify the first 50 entries, and then classify (using
the fisher classifier) the remaining 50 entries. Report the cprob()
values for the 50 titles as well.  From the title or entry itself,
specify the 1-, 2-, or 3-gram that you used for the string to
classify.  Do not repeat strings; you will have 50 unique strings.
For example, in these titles the string used is marked with *s:

*Rachel Goswell* - "Waves Are Universal" (LP Review) 
The *Naked and Famous* - "Passive Me, Aggressive You" (LP Review)
*Negativland* - "Live at Lewis's, Norfolk VA, November 21, 1992" (concert)
Negativland - "*U2*" (LP Review)

Note how "Negativland" is not repeated as a classification string.

Create a table with the title, the string used for classification,
cprob(), predicted category, and actual category.

\end{flushleft}
\subsection{The Answer}

The list of entries was classified manually into a text file that was used as input to the code. The code primarily consisted of functions borrowed from the book code and modified to the project. The classifer and feedfilter modules were also imported for their other functionality.


\lstset{
    language=Python,
    label=code:q1,
    caption={Python script for training and tesing classfier}
}
\lstinputlisting{../q1/q1.py}

The classification using random 1-grams from the title and summary produced very poor results. This is most likely to the fact that the classification is content based and key terms, which would be very effective features, are very sparse. The terms of the classification could be manually selected to convey specific significance and be more appropriate features fo the classification. However, aside from tedious this is also counterproductive. The performance of a classifier should be evaluated under real-world conditions with imperfect data and noise. Therefore, selecting the key terms for classification would only bias the results.

Using only random 1-gram was meaningless and inefficient. There are very few key terms that can differentiate classes in this data, i.e. cup names, player names, football club names. In an attempt to increase accuracy and performance the process was repeated using the title of each entry for the classification. Both results are diaplyed below

In thi situation there were 6 classes making chance accuracy approximately 0.1666. This is the probability of correct classification based on random chance. The classification selects the largest class probability, which is the fischer's probability of belonging to a class. However, because the largest one is always selected there is always aclassification, even with a very small fischer's probability. These types of classifications are the equvalant of guessing and are useless. A restriction was placed in the form of a minimum fischer's probability requirement. The minimum fisher's probability was chosen heuristically at value of p = .16 by using various values and selecting the one that produced the highest f-measure for the classifier
