<B><font face=arial size=2>Gettysburg, Pennsylvania<BR>
November 19, 1863</b><P>

On June 1, 1865, Senator Charles Sumner referred to the most famous speech     
ever given by President Abraham Lincoln. In his eulogy on the slain 
president, he called the Gettysburg Address a "monumental act." He said Lincoln was mistaken that 
 "the world will little note, nor long remember what we say here." Rather, the Bostonian 
 remarked, "The world noted at once what he said, and will never cease to 
 remember it. The battle itself was less important than the speech."<P>
 	
 There are five known copies of the speech in Lincoln's handwriting, each with a 
 slightly different text, and named for the people who first received them:  
 Nicolay, Hay, Everett, Bancroft and Bliss. Two copies apparently were written 
 before delivering the speech, one of which probably was the reading 
 copy. The remaining ones were produced months later  for soldier benefit events. 
 Despite widely-circulated stories to the contrary, the president did not dash 
 off a copy aboard a train to Gettysburg. Lincoln carefully prepared his major 
 speeches in advance; his steady, even script in every manuscript is consistent 
 with a firm writing surface, not the notoriously bumpy Civil War-era trains. 
 Additional versions of the speech  appeared in newspapers of the era, feeding 
 modern-day confusion about the authoritative text.

<B><font face=arial size=2>Bliss Copy</b><P>
	
Ever since Lincoln wrote it in 1864, this version has been the most often reproduced, 
notably on the walls of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington. It is named after Colonel 
Alexander Bliss, stepson of historian George Bancroft. Bancroft asked President 
Lincoln for a copy to use as a fundraiser for soldiers (see "Bancroft Copy" below). 
However, because Lincoln wrote on both sides of the paper, the speech could 
not be reprinted, so Lincoln made another copy at Bliss's request. It is the last 
known copy written by Lincoln and the only one signed and dated by him. Today it 
is on display at the Lincoln Room of the White House.<P>

<B><font face=arial size=2>Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a 
new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men 
are created equal. <P>

Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any 
nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great 
battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a 
final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might 
live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. <P>

But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can not 
hallow -- this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have 
consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will 
little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what 
they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the 
unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It 
is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- 
that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for 
which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve 
that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall 
have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, 
for the people, shall not perish from the earth.<p>

 <B>Nicolay Copy</b><P>
	
Named for John G. Nicolay, President Lincoln's personal secretary, this is 
considered the "first draft" of the speech, begun in Washington on White house 
stationery. The second page is writen on different paper 
stock, indicating it was finished in Gettysburg before the cemetery 
dedication began. Lincoln gave this draft to Nicolay, who went to Gettysburg 
with Lincoln and witnessed the speech. The Library of Congress owns this 
manuscript.<P>

<B>Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth, upon this continent, 
a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that “all 
men are created equal.”<P>

Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any 
nation so conceived, and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great 
battle field of that war. We come to dedicate a portion of it, as a final resting 
place for those who died here, that the nation might live. This we may, in all propriety do.<P>

But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate – we can not consecrate – we can not 
hallow, this ground – The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have 
hallowed it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little 
note, nor long remember what we say here; while it can never forget what they did here.<P>

It is rather for us, the living, we here be dedicated to the great task remaining 
before us – that, from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause 
for which they here, gave the last full measure of devotion – that we here highly 
resolve these dead shall not have died in vain; that the nation, shall have a new 
birth of freedom, and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, 
shall not perish from the earth.</b><P>
<HR>
<B>Hay Copy</b><P>
	
Believed to be the second draft of the speech, President Lincoln gave this copy to John Hay, 
a White House assistant. Hay accompanied Lincoln to Gettysburg and briefly 
referred to the speech in his diary: "the President, in a fine, free 
way, with more grace than is his wont, said his half dozen words of consecration." 
The Hay copy, which includes Lincoln's handwritten changes, also is owned by the 
Library of Congress.<P>

<HR>
<B>Everett Copy</b><P>
	
Edward Everett, the chief speaker at the Gettysburg cemetery dedication, 
clearly was impressed by Lincoln's remarks and wrote to him the next day 
saying, "I should be glad, if I could flatter myself that I came as near 
to the central idea of the occasion, in two hours, as you did in two minutes." In 
1864 Everett asked Lincoln for a copy of the speech to benefit  
Union soldiers, making it the third manuscript copy. Eventually the state 
of Illinois acquired it, where it's preserved at the Abraham Lincoln 
Presidential Library and Museum.<P>

<B>Bancroft Copy</b><P>
	
As noted above, historian George Bancroft asked President Lincoln for a 
copy to use as a fundraiser for soldiers. When Lincoln sent his copy on 
February 29, 1864, he used both sides of the paper, rendering the manuscript 
useless for lithographic engraving. So Bancroft kept this copy and Lincoln 
had to produce an additional one (Bliss Copy). The Bancroft copy is now owned by 
Cornell University.<P>
