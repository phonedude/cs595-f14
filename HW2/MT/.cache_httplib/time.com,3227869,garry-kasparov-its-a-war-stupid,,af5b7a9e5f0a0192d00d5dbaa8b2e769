The leaders of the free world, meanwhile, are struggling to find the right terminology to free themselves from the moral responsibility to provide that protection. Putin&rsquo;s bloody invasion of a sovereign European nation is an incursion, much like Crimea &mdash; remember Crimea? &mdash; was an &ldquo;uncontested arrival&rdquo; instead of <em>anschluss</em>. A civilian airliner was blown out of the sky just six weeks ago &mdash; remember MH17? &mdash; and with more than 100 victims still unidentified, the outrage has already dissipated into polite discussions about whether it should be investigated as a crime, a war crime or neither.</p>

Moscow&rsquo;s smoke screens are hardly necessary in the face of so much willful blindness. Putin&rsquo;s lies are obvious and expected. European leaders and the White House are even more eager than the Kremlin to pretend this conflict is local and so requires nothing more than vague promises from a very safe distance. As George Orwell wrote in his 1946 essay on language right before starting work on his novel <em>1984</em> (surely not a coincidence): &ldquo;But if thought corrupts language, language can also corrupt thought.&rdquo; The Western rhetoric of appeasement creates a self-reinforcing loop of mental and moral corruption. Speaking the truth now would mean confessing to many months of lies, just as it took years for Western leaders to finally admit Putin didn&rsquo;t belong in the G-7 club of industrialized democracies.</p>

Generic wishes about &ldquo;mobilizing the international community&rdquo; were bad enough six months ago. Hearing them repeated as Ukrainian towns fall to Russian troops is a parody. (If legitimacy is what Obama is after, Russia is clearly in violation of nearly every point of the 1974 U.N. Resolution 3314, &ldquo;definition of aggression.&rdquo;) Perhaps Poroshenko should have matched Obama&rsquo;s casual wardrobe by wearing a T-shirt that read, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a War, Stupid.&rdquo; As Russian tanks and artillery push back the overmatched Ukrainian forces, Obama&rsquo;s repeated insistence that there is no military solution in Ukraine sounds increasingly delusional. There is no time to teach a drowning man to swim.</p>
<p>The U.S., Canada and even Europe have responded to Putin&rsquo;s aggression, it is true, but always a few moves behind, always after the deterrent potential of each action had passed. Strong sanctions and a clear demonstration of support for Ukrainian territorial integrity (as I recommended at the time) would have had real impact when Putin moved on Crimea in February and March. A sign that there would be real consequences would have split his elites as they pondered the loss of their coveted assets in New York City and London.</p>
<p>Then in April and May, the supply of defensive military weaponry would have forestalled the invasion currently under way, or at least raised its price considerably &mdash; making the Russian public a factor in the Kremlin&rsquo;s decisionmaking process much earlier. Those like me who called for such aid at the time were called warmongers, and policymakers again sought dialogue with Putin. And yet war has arrived regardless, as it always does in the face of weakness.</p>
<p>As one of the pioneers of the analogy I feel the irony in how it has quickly gone from scandal to clich&eacute; to compare Putin to Hitler, for better and for worse. Certainly Putin&rsquo;s arrogance and language remind us more and more of Hitler&rsquo;s, as does how well he has been rewarded for them. For this he can thank the overabundance of Chamberlains in the halls of power today &mdash; and there is no Churchill in sight.</p>
<p>As long as it is easy, as long as Putin moves from victory to victory without resistance, he gains more support. He took Crimea with barely a shot fired. He flooded eastern Ukraine with agents and weaponry while Europe dithered. The oligarchs who might have pressured Putin at the start of his Ukrainian adventure are now war criminals with no way back. The pressure points now are harder to reach.</p>
<p>The Russian military commanders, the ones in the field, are not fools. They are aware that NATO is watching and could blow them to bits in a moment. They rely on Putin&rsquo;s aura of invincibility, which grows every day the West refuses to provide Ukraine with military support. Those commanders must be made to understand that they are facing an overwhelming force, that their lives are in grave danger, that they can and will be captured and prosecuted. To make this a credible threat requires immediate military aid, if not yet the &ldquo;boots on the ground&rdquo; everyone but Putin is so keen to avoid. If NATO nations refuse to send lethal aid to Ukraine now it will be yet another green light to Putin.</p>
<p>Sanctions are still an important tool, and those directly responsible for commanding this war, such as Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu must be held accountable. Sanctions must also broaden. The chance to limit them only to influential individuals and companies is over. The Russian people can change Putin&rsquo;s course but have little incentive to take the great risks to do so under current conditions. Only sanctions that bring the costs of Putin&rsquo;s war home can have an impact now. This was always a last resort, and it wouldn&rsquo;t be necessary had the West not reacted with such timidity at every step. (The other factor that is already dimming the Russian people&rsquo;s fervor is the Russian military casualties the Kremlin propaganda machine is trying so hard to cover up.)</p>
<p>As always when it comes to stopping dictators, with every delay the price goes up. Western leaders have protested over the potential costs of action Ukraine at every turn only to be faced with the well-established historical fact that the real costs of inaction are always higher. Now the only options left are risky and difficult, and yet they must be tried. The best reason for acting to stop Putin today is brutally simple: it will only get harder tomorrow.</p>

Moscow&rsquo;s smoke screens are hardly necessary in the face of so much willful blindness. Putin&rsquo;s lies are obvious and expected. European leaders and the White House are even more eager than the Kremlin to pretend this conflict is local and so requires nothing more than vague promises from a very safe distance. As George Orwell wrote in his 1946 essay on language right before starting work on his novel <em>1984<\/em> (surely not a coincidence): &ldquo;But if thought corrupts language, language can also corrupt thought.&rdquo; The Western rhetoric of appeasement creates a self-reinforcing loop of mental and moral corruption. Speaking the truth now would mean confessing to many months of lies, just as it took years for Western leaders to finally admit Putin didn&rsquo;t belong in the G-7 club of industrialized democracies.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-mag\" data-name=\"rr-mag\"><div class=\"read-more-inline magazine has-cover\"><h6 class=\"read-more-list-h read-more-popular\">Popular Among Subscribers<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"popular-lead\"><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3429651\/mary-barras-bumpy-ride-at-the-wheel-of-gm\/?pcd=pw-pas\"><img src=\"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/barra-cover-final.jpg?w=560\" alt=\"General Motors CEO Mary Barra Time Magazine Cover\" title=\"\" data-loaded=\"true\"><\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3429651\/mary-barras-bumpy-ride-at-the-wheel-of-gm\/?pcd=pw-pas\" class=\"read-more-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"read-more-inline-title time-icons time-icons-key\">Mary Barra\u2019s Bumpy Ride at the Wheel of GM<\/h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/subscription.time.com\/storefront\/subscribe-to-time\/link\/1019509.html\" class=\"subscribe-button\">Subscribe<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3397085\/the-tragic-risks-of-american-football\/?pcd=pw-pas\" class=\"read-more-article\" format-article><h3 class=\"read-more-inline-title time-icons time-icons-key\">The Tragic Risks of American Football<\/h3><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3429647\/denzel-goes-old-testament\/?pcd=pw-pas\" class=\"read-more-article\" format-article><h3 class=\"read-more-inline-title time-icons time-icons-key\">Denzel Goes Old Testament<\/h3><\/a><\/div><\/aside><p>Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko just met with U.S. President Barack Obama in Washington, but Obama&rsquo;s subsequent statement showed no sign he&rsquo;s willing to acknowledge reality. Generic wishes about &ldquo;mobilizing the international community&rdquo; were bad enough six months ago. Hearing them repeated as Ukrainian towns fall to Russian troops is a parody. (If legitimacy is what Obama is after, Russia is clearly in violation of nearly every point of the 1974 U.N. Resolution 3314, &ldquo;definition of aggression.&rdquo;) Perhaps Poroshenko should have matched Obama&rsquo;s casual wardrobe by wearing a T-shirt that read, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a War, Stupid.&rdquo; As Russian tanks and artillery push back the overmatched Ukrainian forces, Obama&rsquo;s repeated insistence that there is no military solution in Ukraine sounds increasingly delusional. There is no time to teach a drowning man to swim.<\/p>\n<p>The U.S., Canada and even Europe have responded to Putin&rsquo;s aggression, it is true, but always a few moves behind, always after the deterrent potential of each action had passed. Strong sanctions and a clear demonstration of support for Ukrainian territorial integrity (as I recommended at the time) would have had real impact when Putin moved on Crimea in February and March. A sign that there would be real consequences would have split his elites as they pondered the loss of their coveted assets in New York City and London.<\/p>\n<p>Then in April and May, the supply of defensive military weaponry would have forestalled the invasion currently under way, or at least raised its price considerably &mdash; making the Russian public a factor in the Kremlin&rsquo;s decisionmaking process much earlier. Those like me who called for such aid at the time were called warmongers, and policymakers again sought dialogue with Putin. And yet war has arrived regardless, as it always does in the face of weakness.<\/p>\n<p>As one of the pioneers of the analogy I feel the irony in how it has quickly gone from scandal to clich&eacute; to compare Putin to Hitler, for better and for worse. Certainly Putin&rsquo;s arrogance and language remind us more and more of Hitler&rsquo;s, as does how well he has been rewarded for them. For this he can thank the overabundance of Chamberlains in the halls of power today &mdash; and there is no Churchill in sight.<\/p>\n<p>As long as it is easy, as long as Putin moves from victory to victory without resistance, he gains more support. He took Crimea with barely a shot fired. He flooded eastern Ukraine with agents and weaponry while Europe dithered. The oligarchs who might have pressured Putin at the start of his Ukrainian adventure are now war criminals with no way back. The pressure points now are harder to reach.<\/p>\n<p>The Russian military commanders, the ones in the field, are not fools. They are aware that NATO is watching and could blow them to bits in a moment. They rely on Putin&rsquo;s aura of invincibility, which grows every day the West refuses to provide Ukraine with military support. Those commanders must be made to understand that they are facing an overwhelming force, that their lives are in grave danger, that they can and will be captured and prosecuted. To make this a credible threat requires immediate military aid, if not yet the &ldquo;boots on the ground&rdquo; everyone but Putin is so keen to avoid. If NATO nations refuse to send lethal aid to Ukraine now it will be yet another green light to Putin.<\/p>\n<p>Sanctions are still an important tool, and those directly responsible for commanding this war, such as Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu must be held accountable. Sanctions must also broaden. The chance to limit them only to influential individuals and companies is over. The Russian people can change Putin&rsquo;s course but have little incentive to take the great risks to do so under current conditions. Only sanctions that bring the costs of Putin&rsquo;s war home can have an impact now. This was always a last resort, and it wouldn&rsquo;t be necessary had the West not reacted with such timidity at every step. (The other factor that is already dimming the Russian people&rsquo;s fervor is the Russian military casualties the Kremlin propaganda machine is trying so hard to cover up.)<\/p>\n<p>As always when it comes to stopping dictators, with every delay the price goes up. Western leaders have protested over the potential costs of action Ukraine at every turn only to be faced with the well-established historical fact that the real costs of inaction are always higher. Now the only options left are risky and difficult, and yet they must be tried.

He said the jihadi fighters later shelled the town, wounding a number of civilians.<\/p>\n<p>The United States and five Arab allies launched an aerial campaign against Islamic State fighters in Syria early Tuesday with the aim of rolling back and ultimately crushing the extremist group, which has created a proto-state spanning the Syria-Iraq border. Along the way, the militants have massacred captured Syrian and Iraqi troops, terrorized minorities in both countries and beheaded two American journalists and a British aid worker.<\/p>\n<p>The latest airstrikes came as Syria&#8217;s Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem told the Lebanon-based Al-Mayadeen TV that airstrikes alone &#8220;will not be able wipe out&#8221; the Islamic State group. Speaking from New York where he is attending the U.N. General Assembly, al-Moallem said in remarks broadcast Saturday that the U.S. should work with Damascus if it wants to win the war.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;They must know the importance of coordination with the people of this country because they know what goes on there,&#8221; al-Moallem said. The U.S. has ruled out any coordination with President Bashar Assad&#8217;s government, which is at war with the Islamic State group as well as Western-backed rebels.<\/p>\n<p>The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the coalition&#8217;s strikes near Kobani came amid heavy fighting between the Islamic State group and members of the Kurdish force known as the People&#8217;s Protection Units, or YPK.<\/p>\n<p>The Britain-based group, which relies on activists inside Syria, had no immediate word on casualties from Saturday&#8217;s strikes. The Observatory reported Friday that 13 civilians have been killed by the strikes since they began.<\/p>\n<p>Kurdish fighter Majid Goran told the Associated Press by telephone from Kobani that two bombs were dropped over the nearby village of Ali Shar, at 6 a.m. (0300 GMT), but that the positions they struck were empty.<\/p>\n<p>Turkey&#8217;s Dogan news agency reported Saturday that the sound of heavy fighting could be heard from the Turkish border village of Karaca. The agency said Kurdish forces retook some positions they had lost to the Islamic militants a few days ago. It did not cite a source for the report.<\/p>\n<p>Dozens of people wounded in the fighting arrived in Turkey for treatment on Saturday, it said.<\/p>\n<p>Another Kurdish fighter, Ismet Sheikh Hasan, said the Turkish military on Saturday night retaliated after stray shells landed on Turkish territory, firing in the Ali Shar region. He said the Turkish action left Kurdish fighters in the middle of the crossfire.<\/p>\n<p>He said that on Friday, the Islamic militants were attacking the Kobani area from the east with tanks and artillery, advancing on Ali Shar and Haja. He said some 20 people were killed, including Kurdish fighters and civilians, while another 50 people were wounded.<\/p>\n<p>The fighting around Kobani sparked one of the largest single outflows of refugees since Syria&#8217;s conflict began more than three years ago. The Syrian Kurdish forces have long been one of the most effective fighting units battling the Islamic State, but the tide has turned in recent weeks as the Islamic militants have attacked with heavy weapons likely looted from neighboring Iraq.<\/p>\n<p>The Observatory said other coalition airstrikes targeted Islamic State compounds in the central province of Homs and the northern regions of Raqqa and Aleppo. The group said 31 explosions were heard in the city of Raqqa, the group&#8217;s de facto capital, and its suburbs.<\/p>\n<p>The Local Coordination Committees, another activist group, said the strikes in the east hit the province of Deir el-Zour as well as Raqqa. The LCC also said the coalition targeted grain silos west of Deir el-Zour city.<\/p>\n<p>It was not immediately clear why the silos were targeted.<\/p>\n<p>Max Blumenfeld, a spokesman for U.S. Central Command, said the U.S. airstrikes &#8220;don&#8217;t target food or anything else than can be used by the civilian population.&#8221; But he said that until the military reviews images from planes that participated in the strikes, he could not rule out that silos were hit.<\/p>\n<p>He said the airstrikes are aimed at specific Islamic State targets such as command and control centers, transportation and logistics, and oil refineries, &#8220;but not food that could have an impact upon the civilian population.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Our targets are structures that combatants would use,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>In recent days coalition warplanes had struck oil-producing facilities in eastern Syria in a bid to cut off one of the Islamic State group&#8217;s main revenue streams &mdash; black market oil sales that the U.S. says generate up to $2 million a day.<\/p>\n<p>The coalition striking Syria includes Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain and Jordan, and the strikes are an extension of the U.S. campaign in neighboring Iraq launched in August.<\/p>\n<p>Near the capital Damascus, Syrian troops meanwhile entered the once rebel-held northeastern suburb of Adra after days of clashes, Syrian state TV said. The advance came two days after troops captured the nearby Adra industrial zone.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3437245\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"World","slug":"world","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/world\/","description":"The latest news and analysis from TIME's correspondents on world politics, diplomacy, conflict, culture, humanitarian disasters, religion and much more"},"tag":{"name":"Syria","slug":"syria","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tag\/syria\/"},"tags":"Syria","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/syrian-refugees-isis.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/syrian-refugees-isis.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/syrian-refugees-isis.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/syrian-refugees-isis.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/syrian-refugees-isis.jpg?w=1100"},"credit":"Bulent Kilic\u2014AFP\/Getty Images","caption":"Syrian Kurdish boys, fleeing an onslaught by ISIS, sit in a truck as they cross the Syria Turkey border at the southeastern town of Suruc in Sanliurfa province, on Sept. 27, 2014.

They refused to leave until police cleared them out by early Saturday afternoon. The protesters, the youngest of whom is 16, were arrested for offenses including assault and disorderly conduct.<\/p>\n<p>The standoff follows a weeklong strike by students demanding China&#8217;s Communist leaders allow Hong Kong fully democratic elections in 2017. Thousands of university and college students who had spent the week boycotting classes were joined Friday by a smaller group of high school students.<\/p>\n<p>At least 34 people have been injured since the protest began, including four police officers and 11 government staff and guards, authorities said. One of the officers suffered a gash after being poked by one of the umbrellas the protesters have been using to deflect pepper spray.<\/p>\n<p>Police issued a news release urging the protesters to leave peacefully and avoid obstructing officers, saying that otherwise they would &#8220;soon take actions to restore public order.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Ingrid Sze, a 22-year-old student at the Hong Kong Institute of Education, said she joined the demonstrators after seeing the police take action.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t participate in the boycott all week. But I saw what was happening to the students live on TV and I thought what the police were doing was so outrageous I had to come out tonight to support the students and my friends,&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n<p>Hong Kong Secretary for Security Lai Tung-kwok told reporters that police acted appropriately and gave students sufficient warning before starting the process of clearing the square.<\/p>\n<p>China, which took control of the former British colony in 1997, has promised that Hong Kong can have universal suffrage. But tensions over the Asian financial hub&#8217;s political future boiled over after China&#8217;s legislature last month ruled out letting the public nominate candidates, instead insisting they be screened by a committee of Beijing loyalists similar to the one that currently picks the city&#8217;s leader.<\/p>\n<p>Hong Kong&#8217;s young people have been among the most vocal supporters of full democracy in recent years, fueled by anger over widening inequality. They also fear that Beijing&#8217;s tightening grip is eroding the city&#8217;s rule of law and guaranteed civil liberties unseen on the mainland such as freedom of speech.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We really want real democracy, so we&#8217;ll stay here and fight to get what we want,&#8221; said Jo Tai, a 28-year-old teacher. &#8220;We don&#8217;t want everyone else to decide our future; we want the right to decide our future for this generation and the next generation.&#8221; She and others said they were prepared to be arrested.<\/p>\n<p>Demonstrators chanted slogans including &#8220;Fight to the end&#8221; and &#8220;Free the protesters&#8221; and carried placards calling for civil disobedience. Supporters dropped off piles of water bottles, energy drinks, bread, chocolate, biscuits, fruit and other provisions.<\/p>\n<p>Organizers said those arrested at government headquarters included Joshua Wong, a 17-year-old leader of the activist group Scholarism, who was dragged away by four officers. Wong, a recent high school graduate, gained prominence two years ago after he organized protests that forced Hong Kong&#8217;s government to back off plans to introduce a Chinese national education curriculum that some feared was a form of brainwashing.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Our movement is peaceful and does not use aggression,&#8221; said University of Hong Kong students&#8217; union president Yvonne Leung. &#8220;Students who decided to storm inside (the government complex) knew about their legal responsibility.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The student protest was organized independently of Occupy Central, an alliance of pro-democracy activists planning to blockade Hong Kong&#8217;s financial district to call for genuine democratic reforms.<\/p>\n<p>On Saturday, several Occupy Central members joined students protesting outside the square.<\/p>\n<p>Benny Tai, a key leader of the Occupy Central movement, told reporters that the group would &#8220;stay with the students until the end and risk getting arrested ourselves.&#8221; Tai criticized the amount of force police used on students.<\/p>\n<p>Occupy Central has hinted that its blockade will begin Wednesday, China&#8217;s National Day holiday. But the organizers canceled a planned announcement Sunday to confirm the timing, saying they wanted to focus on supporting the students.<\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-pos=\"5\"><object id=\"bc-video-3800241818001-5\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#000000\"><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"1847503743001\"><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/wp.me\/p5HMd-eqaN\"><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"TIME_onTemplateLoad\"><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"TIME_onTemplateReady\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"><param name=\"htmlFallback\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"3800241818001\"><\/object><\/div>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3437205\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"World","slug":"world","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/world\/","description":"The latest news and analysis from TIME's correspondents on world politics, diplomacy, conflict, culture, humanitarian disasters, religion and much more"},"tag":{"name":"Hong Kong","slug":"hong-kong","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tag\/hong-kong\/"},"tags":"Hong Kong","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/hong-kong-protests1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/hong-kong-protests1.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/hong-kong-protests1.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/hong-kong-protests1.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/hong-kong-protests1.jpg?w=1100"},"credit":"Lam Yik Fei\u2014Getty Images","caption":"Thousands of protesters take part of a rally outside the Hong Kong government complex on September 27, 2014 in Hong Kong.

After telling the passengers to get out, the driver suddenly began attacking them, police say.<\/p>\n<p>Chicas is now recovering from a serious head wound. San Francisco District Attorney George Gascon said 26-year-old Patrick Karajua pleaded not guilty to the hammer attack.<\/p>\n<p>The charges come just days after the Gascon and the Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey warned Uber, Lyft and Sidecar that they are <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3431299\/san-francisco-los-angeles-threaten-shut-down-uber-lyft\/\" target=\"_blank\">operating illegally<\/a> and could face civil penalties. The attorneys say the ride share companies mislead customers by claiming their background checks of drivers screen out anyone who has committed driving violations and other criminal offenses.<\/p>\n<p>Uber responded to the alleged hammer attack by emphasizing its policy of suspending a driver charged with serious crimes. &#8220;Safety is Uber&#8217;s #1 priority.

And now bereaved owners like Brittany Preston, Lexie&#8217;s owner, are suing cities and police departments, expressing outrage at what they see as an abuse of power by police. Animal activists, meanwhile, are turning to state legislatures to combat the problem, with demands for better police training in dealing with pets.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">There are no official tallies of dog killings by police, but media reports suggest there are, at minimum, dozens every year, and possibly many more. When it comes to Preston&#8217;s dog, officials from the city of St. Clair Shores and the dog owner agree on little. City police say the dog attacked, prompting officers to open fire in self-defense. But the lawsuit filed by Preston cites police audio recordings to argue that the November 2013 shooting was premeditated, prompted by officers eager to kill a dog. Preston is suing the city for violating her Fourth Amendment right to protection from unreasonable search and seizure.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We want whatever it takes to make sure it doesn&rsquo;t happen again,&#8221; said Christopher Olson, Preston&#8217;s lawyer. &#8220;Before this case I wasn&rsquo;t a dog shooting lawyer, but I am now.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>St. Clair Shores defended the officers&#8217; actions.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The animal was only put down after a decision was made that it was in the best interest of the residents,&#8221; said city attorney Robert Ihrie, who is defending the city in the lawsuit. &#8220;Sometimes police officers are in a position where they need to make very quick decisions for the protection of themselves and others.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The Fourth Amendment argument gained traction in 2005, when the San Jose chapter of the Hells Angels sued the city and the police department because officers had killed dogs during a gang raid in 1998. A <a href=\"http:\/\/www.naiaonline.org\/pdfs\/9thUSCircuit%20unreasonable%20search%20n%20seizure.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">federal appeals judge<\/a> found that &#8220;the Fourth Amendment forbids the killing of a person&rsquo;s dog&#8230; when that destruction is unnecessary,&#8221; and the Hells Angels ultimately won $1.8 million in damages. In addition to the St. Clair lawsuit, other lawsuits stemming from police shootings of dogs are being planned or filed in <a href=\"http:\/\/denver.cbslocal.com\/2014\/07\/11\/owner-of-dog-killed-by-idaho-police-plans-lawsuit\/\" target=\"_blank\">Idaho<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nbclosangeles.com\/news\/local\/Hawthorne-Police-Hand-Dog-Shooting-Case-To-Outside-Agencies-215172541.html\" target=\"_blank\">California,<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.reviewjournal.com\/news\/las-vegas\/dog-owners-sue-north-las-vegas-police-over-pet-shootings\" target=\"_blank\">Nevada.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>At the same time, animal-rights activists are lobbying police departments to implement pet training for all officers. Several states including Illinois and <a href=\"http:\/\/denver.cbslocal.com\/2014\/09\/25\/after-another-dog-killed-animal-training-begins-for-police\/\" target=\"_blank\">Colorado <\/a>have enacted measures to reduce dog shootings, and others states are considering legislation. In 2011, <a href=\"http:\/\/cops.igpa.uillinois.edu\/resources\/police-dog-encounters\" target=\"_blank\">the Department of Justice published a report on dog-related police incidents<\/a>, which included advice on how to handle dogs without killing them.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s much more likely that a cop is going to encounter a dog than a terrorist, yet there&rsquo;s no training,&rdquo; said Ledy Van Kavage, an attorney for the advocacy group Best Friends Animal Society. &#8220;If you have a fear or hatred of dogs, then you shouldn&#8217;t be a police officer, just like if you have a hatred of different social groups.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Brian Kilcommons, a professional dog-trainer who has trained more than 40,000 dogs and published books on the subject, said some police officers accidentally antagonize dogs right from the start, without even trying. &#8220;Police officers go into a situation with full testosterone body language, trying to control the situation,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what will set a dog off.&rdquo; Kilcommons is developing an app that could help police officers evaluate the best way to handle a dog, including tips on reading body language and non-lethal strategies for containing them. &#8220;A bag of treats goes a long way,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>But Jim Crosby, a retired Lieutenant with the Jacksonville Sheriff&#8217;s Office in Florida who now works in dog training, said there are sometimes cases that require police force.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;<span class=\"s1\">If you&#8217;re executing a high-risk, hard-going entry with an armed suspect, the officers don&rsquo;t have time to play nice and throw cookies at the dog<\/span>,&#8221; said Crosby, who was commenting on police handling of dogs in general and not any specific case. But he emphasized that such situations are few and far between: &#8220;Police absolutely have the right to protect themselves against a reasonable and viable threat&mdash;but the presence of a dog is not necessarily a reasonable or viable threat.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Ronald Janota, a retired Lieutenant Colonel with the Illinois State Police who now serves as an expert witness on use of force, acknowledged that officers are often at &#8220;heightened awareness&#8221; when confronting dogs. &#8220;If you&#8217;re the first or second through the door, you don&#8217;t have time to put a collar on the dog if the dog is literally lunging at you,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If you&#8217;re entering the house legally, you have the right to protect yourself.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Regardless of the circumstances, a dog&#8217;s death at the hands of police can be devastating to owners.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&ldquo;People are getting married later, if at all, people are having children later, if at all, and pets are filling an emotional niche,&rdquo; Kilcommons said. &ldquo;Before, if you had a dog and it got killed, you got another one. Now dogs are in our homes and in our hearts. They&rsquo;re not replaceable. So when they&rsquo;re injured or killed, people are retaliating.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>In St. Clair Shores, where Lexie died, the city is fighting the lawsuit but the police department now requires its officers to undergo animal control training.<\/p>\n<p>Van Kavage said that kind of training is crucial, even if just to instill a sense of trust in the police.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If a cop shoots your pet, do you think you&rsquo;re ever going to trust a cop again?&#8221; she said. &#8220;To control a dog, 99% of the time you don&rsquo;t need a gun. You just need to yell &#8216;sit!&#8217; &#8216;stay!&#8217;&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Correction: The original version of this story misidentified the person who said, &#8220;<\/i><\/span><i>To control a dog, 99% of the time you don&rsquo;t need a gun.

As Barnes explains, Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper was very popular when he was elected four years ago&mdash;but that was when the Democrats had marijuana on the ballot.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not there now,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;and the Governor passed what I think is a very reasonable gun control bill that has hurt him with the gun people,&rdquo; whose support he had last time around. With Coloradans divided on their Democratic governor&rsquo;s report card, Barnes fears, their Democratic Senator&rsquo;s star may fall. This state, Barnes says, &ldquo;is the only place where I think a governors&rsquo; race could have an effect on the Senate race.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s the only exciting Senate race to watch. Far from it: Barnes counts seven other states where tight polls make the election too close to call, for now.<\/p>\n<p>Take Louisiana, where Mary Landrieu (D) will defend her seat against Rep. Bill Cassidy, who has pulled ahead in the polls. But Barnes asks, &ldquo;Will Louisiana give up the chairmanship of the energy committee&mdash;when hydrocarbons are so important to Louisiana&mdash;for a doctor who will have no seniority and will not have good committees even if the Republicans control the Senate?&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>In Alaska, he says, it&rsquo;s impossible to predict the tight race between Sen. Mark Begich (D) and Dan Sullivan&mdash;a race in which the NRA recently <a href=\"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/2014\/09\/24\/nra-alaska-senate_n_5878300.html\">declined<\/a> to endorse either candidate. &ldquo;The national pollsters are having trouble even running polls in Alaska,&rdquo; Barnes says, because cell phone-based polling doesn&rsquo;t <a href=\"http:\/\/election.princeton.edu\/2014\/09\/25\/alaska-voters-powerful-but-mysterious\/\">work<\/a> there.<\/p>\n<p>In Kansas, Barnes says, it looked like a fairly clear victory for Republican incumbent Pat Roberts&mdash;until the Democrat in the race, Chad Taylor, pulled out and endorsed the Independent candidate, Greg Orman. Orman is now <a href=\"http:\/\/www.realclearpolitics.com\/epolls\/2014\/senate\/ks\/kansas_senate_roberts_vs_orman-5216.html\">ahead<\/a> in the polls.<\/p>\n<p>Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is one of the biggest names in American politics, but even this will not protect him from a testy race. His opponent Alison Lundergan Grimes has given him a run for his money at the polls, and garnered plenty of media attention. &ldquo;That could be an upset,&rdquo; Barnes says, &ldquo;as it was when Tom Daschle, the Majority Leader of the Senate, got defeated in South Dakota, which I thought was impossible. But it&rsquo;s not impossible for a leader of the Senate to get defeated.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Close-call races will make for an interesting month in North Carolina, Iowa, Kansas and Georgia as well. &ldquo;The races are so close,&rdquo; Barnes says, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s the people, the public, the voters. I&rsquo;ve never seen them as turned off as they are today with both parties. The people are not <em>for<\/em> people, they&rsquo;re against people, and there&rsquo;s just utter disgust because we&rsquo;ve not been able to get more done in Congress.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Barnes, who has close ties to several of the Democrats on the ballot this fall, believes his party has tried to keep the issues simple and appearances by national Democrats rare. &ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t people coming in from outside the state like the President or the Vice-President or the cabinet officers&rdquo; to stump for candidates, he says.<\/p>\n<p>If nothing else, Barnes hopes this cycle sends a message to Congress that it&rsquo;s time for change and action. &ldquo;I hope that it&rsquo;s gonna make the leaders of both parties understand that they cannot go to Washington and create gridlock just for the political benefit of a party,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Democrat, but the Democrats have not been as responsible as they should have been, along with the Republicans. I&rsquo;d like to see the voters punish a Congress that was a do-nothing Congress.&rdquo;<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3438054\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/politics\/","description":"Political insight from the Beltway and beyond.

He was 73.<\/p>\n<p>Traficant was seriously injured Tuesday after a vintage tractor flipped over on him as he tried to park it inside a barn on the family farm near Youngstown. He died four days later in the hospital, said Dave Betras, chairman of the Mahoning County Democratic Party.<\/p>\n<p>The Democrat&#8217;s expulsion from Congress in 2002 came three months after a federal jury in Cleveland convicted him. Prosecutors said he used his office to extract bribes from businesspeople and coerced staffers to work on his farm and his house boat on the Potomac River in Washington. He also was charged with witness tampering, destroying evidence and filing false tax returns. He spent seven years in prison.<\/p>\n<p>Traficant&#8217;s notoriety was rivaled only by his eccentricity.<\/p>\n<p>He loved to play the buffoon during his 17 years in Congress. He got plenty of notice within the staid, buttoned-down Capitol and airtime on C-SPAN for his messy mop of hair &mdash; revealed to be a wig when he went to prison &mdash; his typical wardrobe of cowboy boots, denim or polyester suits, and his bombastic speaking style.<\/p>\n<p>His made-for-TV rants on the House floor invariably ended with the signoff &#8220;Beam me up,&#8221; which Traficant borrowed from &#8220;Star Trek&#8221; to show his disgust or bemusement at whatever he found particularly outrageous.<\/p>\n<p>He was born May 8, 1941, in Youngstown and was a quarterback for the University of Pittsburgh, where he played with future NFL coaches Mike Ditka and Marty Schottenheimer.<\/p>\n<p>He worked as a drug counselor for 10 years before running for Mahoning County sheriff at a colleague&#8217;s suggestion.<\/p>\n<p>He endeared himself to voters in the early 1980s by defying the courts and going to jail for three nights rather than foreclose on the homes of workers laid off from the city&#8217;s dying steel industry.<\/p>\n<p>The antagonism between Traficant and federal law enforcement authorities lasted throughout his public career, with Traficant trumpeting it as proof that he was on the side of &#8220;the little guy&#8221; against powerful government interests.<\/p>\n<p>He faced his first federal bribery and corruption trial in 1983, when he was Mahoning County sheriff. Prosecutors accused Traficant of taking bribes to protect mobsters&#8217; criminal activity. He defended himself in court, although he was not a lawyer, and won. He argued that he was conducting a one-person sting.<\/p>\n<p>He was elected to Congress the following year and was easily re-elected eight times.<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3437604\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/politics\/","description":"Political insight from the Beltway and beyond.

In July in Arlington, Tex., where George W. Bush gave Jeter a pair of cowboy boots, two pilgrims in the stands lofted a sign reading, &#8220;We drove 1,152 miles to say goodbye to the Captain!&#8221; For the last month, all Yankees uniforms have sported a &#8220;2&#8221; patch, normally reserved to pay tribute to deceased teammates; yet Jeter is not only not dead yet, he&#8217;s still playing for the Yankees.

Of course they took the next two, proceeding to the World Series and sending the A&#8217;s home.<\/p>\n<p><strong>(READ: Corliss on <a title=\"My team, the A's\" href=\"http:\/\/content.time.com\/time\/arts\/article\/0,8599,2092704,00.html\" target=\"_blank\">his favorite team, the A&#8217;s<\/a>)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Jul. 1, 2004: The dive into the stands.<\/strong> Game tied, top of the 12th inning, and the hated rival Red Sox threatening with men on second and third. Trot Nixon hits a pop fly near the foul line that a hustling Jeter catches, <a title=\"Diving catch\" href=\"http:\/\/m.mlb.com\/video\/v2685729\/bosnyy-jeter-goes-into-the-stands-for-the-catch%20\" target=\"_blank\">his momentum carrying him three rows into the sideline stands<\/a> and earning him severe scratches and bruises. His catch saved two runs, and while he was on the way to a hospital, the Yanks won in the 13th. &#8220;Jeter, of course, scared the hell out of everybody,&#8221; said Yankee manager Joe Torre. &#8220;Hopefully, he&#8217;ll be all right.&#8221; He was, though <a title=\"Bleacher Report on dive into stands\" href=\"http:\/\/bleacherreport.com\/articles\/394185-derek-jeter-and-the-greatest-lie-ever-told%20\" target=\"_blank\">fans overrated the strategic importance of the catch<\/a>: the Yanks were 7&frac12; games ahead of the Red Sox that day. In the playoffs, Boston would rally from a three-game deficit to beat the New York and win its first World Series in 86 years.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Jul. 9, 2011: The 3,000th hit.<\/strong> Struggling at the plate, his skills publicly mocked by Yankee brass, the 37-year-old made a bold statement by going five-for-five: three singles, a double and, for his 3,000th hit, <a title=\"Jeter's 300th hit\" href=\"http:\/\/m.mlb.com\/nyy\/video\/v16783041\/tbnyy-jeter-picks-up-hit-no-3000-with-a-homer\/?c_id=nyy\" target=\"_blank\">a home run over the left field wall<\/a> on a David Price slider. For his fifth hit, he knocked in the winning run in the eighth. &#8220;If we didn&#8217;t win, it definitely would have put a damper on things,&#8221; Jeter said. Yankees 5, Rays 4.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sep. 25, 2014: The farewell hit.<\/strong> In his final game at Yankee Stadium, which scalpers had made <a title=\"Ticket prices for last game\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nydailynews.com\/sports\/baseball\/yankees\/rainout-fears-derek-jeter-final-home-game-drive-prices-article-1.1952038%20\" target=\"_blank\">the most expensive regular-season ticket in MLB history<\/a>, Jeter doubled in a run in the first inning and, in the seventh, reached first on an Orioles error that plated two more. That would have been his final at-bat in the Bronx if Yanks closer David Robertson hadn&#8217;t surrendered three runs in the top of the ninth to even the score at 5. In the bottom of the inning, a single and a bunt put the winning run on second for Jeter. Instead of walking him, as conventional strategy dictated, Orioles skipper Buck Showalter (Jeter&#8217;s first manager on the Yankees) had reliever Evan Meek pitch to the star. Jeter hit a clean single to right, which scored the winning run. He accepted hugs from current and former teammates, walked out to genuflect at his shortstop position and was lifted to the heavens on a cloud of cheers. Did you see that, Pope Francis?<\/p>\n<p><strong>(WATCH: <a title=\"Jeter game-winning hit in last Yankee stadium at-bat\" href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3431541\/derek-jeter\/%20\" target=\"_blank\">Jeter&#8217;s big hit in his last Yankee Stadium game<\/a>)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Stephen Colbert used to ask of George W. Bush, &#8220;Great President? Or the Greatest President?&#8221; That&#8217;s the question about Jeter. &ldquo;New York Yankees manager Joe Girardi will likely play without a shortstop next year,&#8221; wrote <a title=\"No more Yankees shortstop\" href=\"http:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/allenstjohn\/2014\/09\/25\/icon-or-overrated-the-two-stats-that-measure-derek-jeters-greatness-or-lack-thereof\/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>USA Today&#8217;<\/em>s Mike Foss<\/a>. &#8220;How can you replace the irreplaceable? You can&rsquo;t . . . The Yankees can never have another shortstop. It wouldn&rsquo;t be proper.&rdquo; Hilarious hyperbole aside, the statement is pretty rich because, in the view of the game&#8217;s stats mavens, Jeter is a lousy shortstop. His limited range at getting to ground balls has converted many outs to hits, and dragged down his Wins Above Replacement (WAR), the stat that measures a player&#8217;s offensive and defensive skills. This year, when the Angels&#8217; Mike Trout leads with a WAR of 8.0, meaning he&#8217;s worth eight games above a replacement player, Jeter&#8217;s is a pathetic 0.1 &mdash; the lowest of any regular player in the major leagues.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;How are the Yankees going to fill the void left by Derek Jeter?&#8221; Jack of Toronto sarcasticated <a title=\"Chat Wrap 9\/9\/14\" href=\"http:\/\/espn.go.com\/sportsnation\/chat\/_\/id\/51097%20\" target=\"_blank\">on David Schoenfield&#8217;s ESPN Chat Wrap a few weeks ago<\/a>. &#8220;There aren&#8217;t a lot of SS out there who can hit an empty .270 and have the defensive range of a statue. hmmm. Maybe they could just put a statue of him at SS, and hope no one notices the difference.&#8221; Schoenfield added: &#8220;But statues clearly lack leadership skills and fist-pumping ability!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Leadership skills mean a lot, though the taciturn Jeter leads by example. And if clubhouse inspiration is supposed to translate into championships, his has got rusty in the past 14 years &mdash; the Yanks have won only one World Series since 2000, and haven&#8217;t earned a playoff spot since 2011. But I&#8217;m not going to take sides in the great debate: Jeter H. Christ vs. the Jeter Beaters. For opposing views from ESPN pundits, <a title=\"Colin Cowherd on Jeter\" href=\"http:\/\/espn.go.com\/espnradio\/play?id=11594020\" target=\"_blank\">listen to Colin Cowherd on Jeter&#8217;s lasting value<\/a>, and <a title=\"Olbermann on Jeter\" href=\"http:\/\/espn.go.com\/video\/clip?id=11580820\" target=\"_blank\">watch Keith Olbermann take a dump on No. 2<\/a>. I&#8217;ll just say this: For much of his career, Jeter was an excellent offensive player on an excellent team (1996-2001); then he was a very good player on an underachieving team of big stars; and at the end he hung around as one of the least productive players at his position. That seem fair?<\/p>\n<p>The real Jeter magic was his aura. He carried himself with poise; he was the charmed son of interracial parents (father black, mother white, Derek mauve) who this season could be seen at nearly every game rooting for their lad. A master at withholding emotions, he managed to give 20 years of post-game interviews without saying anything controversial &mdash; in fact, anything at all. That is a stunning accomplishment in an age of blab-your-brains-out social media. He was never tainted with taking performance-enhancing drugs in a baseball era stained by steroids. And he gave the impression of being a team-first guy, less interested in personal stats than in extending the bountiful legacy of the New York Yankees.<\/p>\n<p><strong>(WATCH: <a title=\"2014 All-Star Game\" href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/2992669\/all-star-game-all-about-derek-jeter\/\" target=\"_blank\">Derek Jeter in his final All-Star Game<\/a>)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In other words, he wasn&#8217;t A-Rod.<\/p>\n<p>Every saint needs a devil, and Alex Rodriguez was perfectly cast as Jeter&#8217;s evil twin. A year, a month and a day younger than Jeter, Rodriguez had far more impressive talents of offensive power and defensive range. First for the Seattle Mariners, then the Texas Rangers and, in 2004, the Yankees, A-Rod made a strong case for being among the game&#8217;s very best. On the all-time top-50 list of best WAR years, the only two active players are Trout (with 10.9 in 2012) and Rodriguez (10.3 in 2000); and A-Rod had three other finishes in the top 100. (Jeter&#8217;s best WAR year, an 8.0 in 1999, lands him in a tie for 264th.) He also enjoyed a Jeterian magic moment of his own: On the last day of the 2009 regular season &mdash; the year he helped the Yankees win their only World Series since 2000 &mdash; Rodriguez <a title=\"A-Rod on Oct. 4, 2009\" href=\"http:\/\/scores.espn.go.com\/mlb\/recap?gameId=291004130\" target=\"_blank\">hit two homers and drove in seven runs, all in one inning<\/a>, thereby extending his record of 30 homers and 100 RBIs to 12 seasons.<\/p>\n<p>Rodriguez and Jeter had been friends from their teens, but the bromance soured into a no-mance by the time A-Rod joined the Yankees. Superior to Jeter at shortstop (a factor that contributed to his high WAR), he didn&#8217;t grouse when Torre shifted him to third base so Jeter could stay put. <a title=\"The Captain biog\" href=\"http:\/\/nypost.com\/2011\/04\/24\/how-jeter-put-a-rod-in-the-yankees-snubhouse\/%20\" target=\"_blank\">Ian O&#8217;Connor&#8217;s Jeter biography, <em>The Captain<\/em><\/a>, implies that A-Rod was frozen out of the Yankee clubhouse by a veteran who wanted to make sure the new guy remained an untrusted outsider.<\/p>\n<p>Rodriguez earned a rep for wilting in the playoffs, though his postseason on-base and slugging percentages are nearly identical to Jeter&#8217;s. Then there&#8217;s the quite plausible theory that A-Rod is a jerk &mdash; playing for himself more than for the team, ignoring the Yankee staff and fans, dallying with Madonna and other naughty ladies, commissioning <a href=\"http:\/\/www.totalprosports.com\/2013\/08\/20\/the-13-most-hilariously-embarrassing-moments-of-alex-rodriguez\/#10\">a portrait of himself as a centaur<\/a>. Last year Rodriguez was banned from baseball for 211 games for taking <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through;\">horse pills<\/span> human growth hormones.<\/p>\n<p><strong>(WATCH: TIME&#8217;s Sean Gregory on <a title=\"Sean Gregory on CBS\" href=\"http:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/videos\/a-rod-vs-major-league-baseball\/\" target=\"_blank\">A-Rod and steroids<\/a>)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I have a little sympathy for the devil. He was hot to Jeter&#8217;s cool, sometimes pretzeled by pressures Jeter either never felt or never showed. I think A-Rod needed love but didn&#8217;t know how to earn it &mdash; whereas Jeter seemed not to need love, yet got it from everyone. I wonder where Rodriguez was on the night of Jeter&#8217;s Yankee Stadium farewell. He might have wanted to be there, for the pleasure of offering a younger-brother hug, and for the sad realization that, when he returns to the Yankees after his suspension is lifted next year, many fans will pummel him with boos. &#8220;A-Roid!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Playing out the last three years of baseball&#8217;s highest-paid contract won&#8217;t be fun for Rodriguez; there&#8217;ll be no shots of his parents smiling in the luxury boxes. But it will bring a new kind of excitement to the Stadium: not the sanctified Jeter valediction, more a crackling tension before the expected explosion &mdash; tape-measure home run or emotional blowout. And I&#8217;ll bet you this: A-Rod, if he&#8217;s clean and healthy, will have a more productive 40th year than Jeter did, with a higher WAR than 0.1. Saint Derek was so 2014; it&#8217;s time for the devil to get his due.<\/p>\n<div class=\"galleryContainer galleryContainer--embedded\" data-gallery=\"3432464\" data-size=\"default\"><\/div>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3432427\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"Entertainment","slug":"entertainment","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/entertainment\/","description":"From esoteric art to Housewives hullaballoo, TIME Culture covers what's good, bad and breaking right now in music, movies, TV, tech, celebrities and style"},"tag":{"name":"The Cranky Guy","slug":"the-cranky-guy","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tag\/the-cranky-guy\/"},"tags":"Alex Rodriguez|Baseball Hall of Fame|Derek Jeter|New York Yankees|Pope Francis|Sports|The Cranky Guy","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/derek-jeter-a-rod.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/derek-jeter-a-rod.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/derek-jeter-a-rod.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/derek-jeter-a-rod.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/derek-jeter-a-rod.jpg?w=1100"},"credit":"Jim McIsaac&mdash;Getty Images","caption":"Derek Jeter #2 of the New York Yankees gestures to the crowd during a game against the Baltimore Orioles at Yankee Stadium on September 25, 2014 in the Bronx borough of New York City.

He points out that even Apple, to his mind the most user-friendly company, made a big misstep in pushing an <a href=\"time.com\/3426561\/apple-iphone-6-plus-ios-8-problems\/\" target=\"_blank\">iOS 8 software update this week<\/a> that caused some iPhones to be unable to make calls or send texts. Facing thousands of customers furious over the flaw, Apple apologized, and hastily released a fix a day later. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s kind of basic,&rdquo; Mossberg says.<\/p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Mossberg thinks Apple has finally begun to show new momentum under Tim Cook, who took over as Apple&#8217;s CEO following Steve Jobs&#8217; death in 2011. He expects Apple is the company that stands the best chance to revolutionize digital payment in the next two or three years, thanks to its existing credit card database and its promise never to send users&rsquo; real credit card numbers to the cloud.<\/p>\n<p>With so much changing so quickly, Mossberg says, artificially intelligent &ldquo;assistants&rdquo; like Siri and Cortana (Microsoft&#8217;s Siri competitor) &ldquo;are all excellent for what we have now. [But] they&rsquo;re all going to look ridiculous in not 10 years&mdash;four years.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Outside of AI and sensors (Mossberg says &ldquo;we&rsquo;re still in the first inning of wearables&rdquo;), he predicts two technologies must&mdash;and will&mdash;change drastically in the next few years.<\/p>\n<p>One is cars. In terms of in-cabin electronics, he says, &ldquo;until a few years ago, when you opened the door to your car, it was like stepping into a time machine to 1957.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The other: television. Every tech company knows how to redesign the current interface, which he says is the worst of any that we use&mdash;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s low-hanging fruit.&rdquo; That is, until you get the networks and distributors involved, which is where Apple, Intel and other tech companies making a go of things in TV have had to hit pause.<\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-pos=\"8\"><object

Just look at China, where the country&#8217;s double-digit economic growth has largely been fueled by coal, which fulfills 60 percent of its energy mix.<\/p>\n<p>According to a <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cost_of_electricity_by_source\">chart<\/a> showing the levelized cost of energy &#8212; the price at which electricity must be generated from a source to break even &#8212; coal is the second-cheapest form of energy behind hydropower, at $40 per megawatt hour.<\/p>\n<p>Compare that to the cost of nuclear at $60, natural gas at $70, and solar &#8212; which at $280 per MWH, is seven times the cost of coal. Coal is also plentiful, relatively easy to extract &#8212; though admittedly dangerous if mined underground &#8212; and requires minimal processing. And it can be used for power generation (thermal coal) or steelmaking (metallurgical coal).<\/p>\n<p>Of course, coal-fired plants have exacted an enormous price on air quality, and the Chinese government &ndash; which has declared war on pollution &#8212; recently banned the use of coal in smog-cloaked Beijing. Last week, it was <a href=\"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/2014\/09\/12\/china-coal-reduction_n_5811362.html\">announced<\/a> that for the first time in over a decade, Chinese coal imports and coal consumption both dropped.<\/p>\n<p>While that may seem like a dart in coal&#8217;s balloon, coal&#8217;s continued use elsewhere is more than making up for China&rsquo;s restraint.<\/p>\n<p>Germany doesn&#8217;t like to talk about it, but the world leader in the use of renewable energy, particularly solar, is also a big consumer of coal. As The Economist recently <a href=\"http:\/\/www.economist.com\/news\/business\/21600987-cheap-ubiquitous-and-flexible-fuel-just-one-problem-fuel-future\">pointed out<\/a>, Germany&#8217;s production of power from lignite coal is now at 162 billion kilowatts, the highest level since the smokestack-belching days of East Germany.<\/p>\n<p>The same article notes that Japan, which has no natural energy resources of its own and is scrambling to meet electricity demand &#8212; most of its nuclear reactors have been offline since the 2011 Fukushima disaster &#8212; approved a new energy plan in April that includes coal as a long-term electricity source. The Japanese have also invested almost $20 billion in overseas coal projects in the past seven years, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council.<\/p>\n<p>In the United States, even though a shale-gas supply boom has seen many utilities shift to cheaper natural gas, the country will still be generating a third of its energy from coal by 2040 (only 10 percent less than now), according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). That&rsquo;s despite a concerted effort by the Obama administration to force the nation&#8217;s coal-burning power plants to reduce their carbon emissions by a third over the next 15 years.<\/p>\n<p>U.S. coal producers have responded to the trend of falling domestic consumption by exporting more coal overseas. A Wall Street Journal <a href=\"http:\/\/online.wsj.com\/news\/articles\/SB10001424052702303563304579447582374789164\">chart<\/a> shows exports of U.S. coal grew from around 50 million metric tons in 2000 to 106.7 million MT in 2013. Most U.S. coal is destined for Europe, with Brazil, South Korea and China close behind.<\/p>\n<p>All of this is not to suggest that coal producers haven&#8217;t had their problems. The price of benchmark thermal coal over the past three years has dropped from more than $130 a ton to around $80. Metallurgical coal is also at a six-year low.<\/p>\n<p>Despite a huge cutback in production, the coal market continues to be oversupplied. As Oilprice.com <a href=\"http:\/\/oilprice.com\/Energy\/Coal\/Coal-Enters-New-Phase-of-Insecurity.html\">pointed out<\/a> recently, waning steel demand in China has forced mines in Australia to close. Australian producers are also threatened by Chinese plans to build more rail capacity for its domestic coal, which would undermine its coal imports.<\/p>\n<p>In the United States, coal producers are finding it increasingly difficult to lock utilities into long-term contracts that provide stability and protection from price fluctuations. That&#8217;s because the utilities want the flexibility to have short-term contracts, or even buy coal on the spot market, since natural gas continues to be a competitive option.<\/p>\n<p>Looking ahead, though, there doesn&#8217;t appear to be a declining demand curve for coal. Consider this: in Africa, some 60 percent of the continent&#8217;s population, or more than 600 million people, do not have access to electricity. The EIA predicts African coal consumption will rise by 70 percent by 2040. In India, another big consumer of coal, 300 million people remain disconnected to the electricity grid. The country plans to increase its use of renewable energy by 15 percent by 2020, but still faces the challenge of energy demand exceeding supply by 10 percent.<\/p>\n<p>Coal is a likely contender to fill that gap. A recent <a href=\"http:\/\/www.miningaustralia.com.au\/features\/india-s-energy-future-australian-coal-or-renewable\">article<\/a> in Australian Mining states that by 2025, India&#8217;s electricity generation from coal will be reduced from 60 percent to &ldquo;only 50 percent of installed generation &ndash; but that doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean less coal generation.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>In the end, it all comes down to price and government policies. If the economics of coal can be beaten by other electricity sources, the old-school fuel will face pressure, as it already has in the U.S. But as market forces continue to drive the various options available for utilities, coal use &#8212; particularly in developing nations &#8212; is almost certain to go up. Unless governments enact American-style laws to sharply curtail coal power plant emissions, expect King Coal to retain its crown.<\/p>\n<p><em>Read more at OilPrice.com<\/em><\/p>\n<p><a title=\"Oil\" href=\"http:\/\/oilprice.com\/Energy\/Crude-Oil\/Scotlands-Oil-Future-Will-Remain-In-British-Hands.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Scotland&#8217;s Oil Will Remain in British Hands<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a title=\"Nuclear\" href=\"http:\/\/oilprice.com\/Latest-Energy-News\/World-News\/New-Commercial-Nuclear-Battery-Being-Developed.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>New Commercial Nuclear Battery Being Developed<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a title=\"Exports\" href=\"http:\/\/oilprice.com\/Energy\/Natural-Gas\/Why-the-Debate-Over-U.S.-LNG-Exports-Has-Been-Won.html%20\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Why the Debate Over U.S. LNG Exports Has Been Won<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-pos=\"9\"><object id=\"bc-video-57746491001-9\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#000000\"><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"1847503743001\"><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/wp.me\/p5HMd-ep8p\"><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"TIME_onTemplateLoad\"><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"TIME_onTemplateReady\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"><param name=\"htmlFallback\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"57746491001\"><\/object><\/div>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3433213\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"World","slug":"world","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/world\/","description":"The latest news and analysis from TIME's correspondents on world politics, diplomacy, conflict, culture, humanitarian disasters, religion and much more"},"tag":{"name":"energy","slug":"energy","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tag\/energy\/"},"tags":"climate change|coal|energy|global warming|Oil|Pollution|World","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/14-09-26-china-coal.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/14-09-26-china-coal.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/14-09-26-china-coal.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/14-09-26-china-coal.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/14-09-26-china-coal.jpg?w=1100"},"credit":"Frederic J.

In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has struggled with how to regulate the controversial therapy, deterring a lot of doctors from doing them out of concerns for safety and hygiene, among others. But for the first time in Europe, such fecal transplants have been endorsed as a recommended treatment for the infections, as outlined in new guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, a U.K. body.<\/p>\n<p>Infections of <em>C. difficile<\/em> are among the most common in hospitals and can result from prolonged use of antibiotics. They cause patients enormous distress, including severe diarrhea that can lead to dehydration and other complications that make recovery from surgery difficult. Cases have been proliferating in Europe, and new antibiotic-resistant strains are emerging as well, according to data from the upcoming United European Gastroenterology Week meeting in Austria.<\/p>\n<p>The infection is notoriously hard to treat, and if the standard first-line therapies of targeted antibiotics fail, patients and their doctors are willing to try anything to shut down the rampant growth of bacteria. Enter the fecal transplant, which involves doctors taking feces donated by a generous healthy stranger (who doesn&#8217;t harbor <em>C. difficile <\/em>or other infections), liquefying it in a solution of saline, water, or even milk or yogurt, straining it and delivering the resulting solution to another patient via colonoscopy. People generally feel better just a couple days after the transplant, and many recent studies show the treatment cures around 90% of <em>C. difficile<\/em> infections.<\/p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s little question that it works, but only a few facilities, including the Mayo Clinic in Arizona, perform fecal transplants in the U.S. because it isn&rsquo;t standardized yet. Though Mayo Clinic screens donors for months through blood and stool tests, for example, not everyone does. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t really know what&rsquo;s in this concoction that you&rsquo;re putting into somebody, and the FDA really doesn&rsquo;t like that,&rdquo; says Robert Orenstein, associate professor and chair of the division of infectious diseases at Mayo Clinic in Arizona, which began the performing the procedures in 2011, and now attracts patients from all over the world for the treatment.<\/p>\n<p><strong>MORE<\/strong>: <a href=\"http:\/\/healthland.time.com\/2013\/10\/04\/the-latest-thing-in-pills-ones-made-from-poop\/\" target=\"_blank\">The Latest Thing From Pills? Ones Made from Poop<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Another cause for concern: there&rsquo;s no long-term safety data. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s assumed that manipulation of the gut flora may have a lot of other downstream effects,&rdquo; says Orenstein, like affecting inflammatory or metabolic diseases like diabetes. &ldquo;Nobody knows that if you took the microbiome from one individual and placed it into another, whether some of these things might evolve.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Though his facility has performed about 120 fecal transplants so far, Orenstein still calls the procedure &ldquo;medieval.&#8221; Instead of relying on the physical swapping of fecal samples, for example, he anticipates that if the research on the role that microbes can play in our health continues, we may soon have microbiota pills&mdash;super-evolved probiotics, basically&mdash;that will recolonize places like the gut or respiratory tract with the right microorganisms. &#8220;We&rsquo;re just in the beginning,&#8221; he says. &#8220;In a couple years, we&rsquo;ll have almost all of this figured out.&#8221; In the meantime, we can learn from Europe&#8217;s example&mdash;and hope that those pills come soon.<\/p><aside

I&rsquo;d exclaim with annoyance while scrolling past yet another indistinguishable ultrasound picture. &ldquo;Who would post that? Nobody cares what your baby looks like in utero!&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Basically I was the definition of STFU Parents&rsquo; target demographic &mdash; mid-20s, bored, cynical and dismissive of the totally average children of my acquaintances. But all that changed when I got pregnant with twins and had to fight the urge to Instagram my caesarean pictures.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.stfuparentsblog.com\" target=\"_blank\">STFU Parents<\/a> is a hugely popular blog that parodies the oversharing, mommy-jacking, placenta-picture-posting parents of Facebook. It&rsquo;s become a cultural phenomenon in the five years it&rsquo;s been around. The levels of snark on the blog and comment sections are unparalleled, remarkable and often venomous. From mocking babies with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.stfuparentsblog.com\/post\/79164903260\/yoonique-baby-names-2014-edition\" target=\"_blank\">&ldquo;yoonique&rdquo;<\/a> names to defending the rights of people to make trite &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Pregnant&rdquo; <a href=\"http:\/\/http:\/\/www.mommyish.com\/2014\/04\/02\/stfu-parents-pregnancy-pranks-april-fools\/\" target=\"_blank\">April Fools&rsquo; Day jokes<\/a>, no parenting behaviour on social media goes unchecked and ultimately ridiculed. Everybody is a potential target, and the threat of appearing on the blog hovers over new parents, silently policing our Facebook statuses before we even post them.<\/p>\n<p>Countless gallons of digital ink have been spilled on mommy blogs about how hard parenting is, about how much it changes you and about how inconceivable the experience is. At the risk of adding to that ink, it&rsquo;s all true. In my three decades I have never experienced anything more wholly transformative than giving birth and becoming a parent. Certainly, the experience of having twins was probably a bit more intense than most. But becoming a parent felt like, after never seeing water before, I&rsquo;d been dropped in the middle of the ocean and told to swim away from the circling sharks.<\/p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s hard to explain just how extreme this transformation is. You know it&rsquo;s going to be tough going, but it&rsquo;s the relentlessness that really surprises. The newborn phase is rough. It felt almost menial. I&rsquo;d gone from attending events where Chelsea Clinton spoke about gender rights in June, to attending to somebody&rsquo;s dirty diapers in January. My life became a 24\/7 cycle of feeding and cleaning. I also had to get used to having my whole day dictated by these two tiny babies &mdash; how they felt determined how I felt. I could be well rested and happy but if my babies refused a nap, that good mood was lost in a matter of minutes.<\/p>\n<p>Somebody once asked me why I was still stressed out when my babies were now sleeping through the night and the best way I could put it was that it was like I had misplaced my &ldquo;off&rdquo; switch. From the time those babies came into my life, I have been &ldquo;on.&rdquo; After I&rsquo;ve put them to bed and cleaned up after them and made dinner and cleaned up dinner and prepared their food for the next day and expressed milk and finally put myself to bed, I&rsquo;m lying in the dark waiting for that cry on the baby monitor. I&rsquo;m worrying that I&rsquo;ve run out of baby rice for their breakfast. I&rsquo;m feeling guilty about moving them to their own room before the SIDS safe recommendation of 12 months. I&rsquo;m doing anything but sleeping. Because I can&rsquo;t turn that damn switch &ldquo;off.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>And then the loneliness creeps in. Mothers&#8217; groups can be great, but in those early days of engorged breasts, hormones run amok and two babies who just wouldn&rsquo;t sleep, the thought of having to put my best foot forward to a group of single-babied strangers was a bit too much for me.<\/p>\n<p>While we were incredibly lucky to have our families come from overseas to help for many months, they had to leave eventually. When they did, the little temporary village I had constructed around myself crumbled. So I turned to the one village that is accessible to anybody with an Internet connection &mdash; Facebook.<\/p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve struggled with the unspoken rules of social media parent behaviour from the beginning. When you&rsquo;re part of a generation that&rsquo;s come of age posting pictures of our morning muesli on Instagram, having to be tight-lipped about two babies coming out of my body was the most surreal and repressive feeling.<\/p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m now a pretty active member of parenting groups on Facebook, in particular ones for multiple births and parents of premature babies. They&rsquo;ve provided endless comfort, reassurance and wisdom for me, from people who understand what this road is like. These are people who I would never have met without the aid of Facebook. But it took me a long time to even join these groups because I&rsquo;ve been so afraid that my friends would see me contribute there and label me an &ldquo;STFU Parent.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>While I don&rsquo;t doubt the title &ldquo;STFU Parent&rdquo; is well deserved for people who post pictures of their baby&rsquo;s poop, it&rsquo;s important to see the ripple effect its had on standard, non-over-sharing parents who are struggling but are too afraid to say anything. In a world where we are becoming more individualistic and isolated, and standards of parenting are becoming more and more rigorous and unattainable, a blog like STFU Parents can serve to just reinforce that solitude and those unfair standards. We&rsquo;re already pretty alone, now we can&rsquo;t use social media to reach out? We can&rsquo;t share certain kinds of pictures, we can&rsquo;t share pictures too frequently, and we can&rsquo;t name our children certain things. Add this to the other myriad expectations we already face around breastfeeding, sleeping, baby-wearing, vaccinations, introducing solids, meeting milestones, discipline and countless other things, and modern parenting looks more and more impossible.<\/p>\n<p>So this is a plea to give us a break from time to time. We might be a tad insufferable, but we&rsquo;re trying our hardest to navigate parenthood and to do our very best for these little humans we created and love so dearly. Sometimes we&rsquo;re oversharing because we&rsquo;re struggling and we need help and reassurance. Sometimes we&rsquo;re oversharing because we&rsquo;d like advice. Sometimes we&rsquo;re oversharing because we&rsquo;re proud of our survival.
