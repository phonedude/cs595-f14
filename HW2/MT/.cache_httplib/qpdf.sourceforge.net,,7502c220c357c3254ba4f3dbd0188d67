  <title>QPDF: A Content-Preserving PDF Transformation System</title>
 </head>
 <body>
  <h1>What is QPDF?</h1>
  <p>
   QPDF is a command-line program that does structural,
   content-preserving transformations on PDF files.  It could have
   been called something like <i>pdf-to-pdf</i>.  It also provides
   many useful capabilities to developers of PDF-producing software or
   for people who just want to look at the innards of a PDF file to
   learn more about how they work.
  </p>
  <p>
   QPDF is capable of creating linearized (also known as
   web-optimized) files and encrypted files.  It is also capable of
   converting PDF files with object streams (also known as compressed
   objects) to files with no compressed objects or to generate object
   streams from files that don't have them (or even those that already
   do).  QPDF also supports a special mode designed to allow you to
   edit the content of PDF files in a text editor.  For more details,
   please see the documentation links below.
  </p>
  <p>
   QPDF includes support for merging and splitting PDFs through the
   ability to copy objects from one PDF file into another and to
   manipulate the list of pages in a PDF file.  The QPDF library also
   makes it possible for you to create PDF files from scratch.  In
   this mode, you are responsible for supplying all the contents of
   the file, while the QPDF library takes care off all the syntactical
   representation of the objects, creation of cross references tables
   and, if you use them, object streams, encryption, linearization,
   and other syntactic details.
  </p>
  <p>
   QPDF is <i>not</i> a PDF content creation library, a PDF viewer, or
   a program capable of converting PDF into other formats.  In
   particular, QPDF knows nothing about the semantics of PDF content
   streams.  If you are looking for something that can do that, you
   should look elsewhere.  However, once you have a valid PDF file,
   QPDF can be used to transform that file in ways perhaps your
   original PDF creation can't handle.  For example, programs generate
   simple PDF files but can't password-protect them, web-optimize
   them, or perform other transformations of that type.
