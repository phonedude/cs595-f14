If Sponsors, in their sole discretion, elect to incorporate any audio and/or video recording of entrants and/or Winners (the “Recording”) into TODAY or other television shows, the taping and/or the Recording will not be considered an employment opportunity, and Winners and/or entrants will not be entitled to compensation or credit thereof. Sponsors will determine the nature of the Recording in their sole discretion. If the Recording is broadcast, such broadcast will be at a time, for a length of time, and on a date determined by Sponsors in their sole discretion. Winners and/or entrants may be required to return completed and signed appearance releases, confidentiality agreements and such other documents as may be required by Sponsors prior to their appearance on TODAY and participation in the Contest, if any. Failure of entrants to complete and execute these documents in a timely manner, as determined by Sponsors in their sole discretion, may cause the entrant to be disqualified and any potential Prize to be forfeited. The content of the Recording as, and if, finally exhibited and the number of exhibits and re-airs thereof, if any, will be determined by Sponsors in their sole discretion. Winners will not have a right of review, notice, or approval of the content of the Recording or any exhibition or exploitation thereof. Sponsors have the right, in their sole discretion, to disqualify entrants, cause the Prizes to be forfeited, and remove entrants from TODAY at any time, if any entrant’s behavior is deemed by Sponsors to be disruptive or if it may or does cause damage to person, property, or reputation of Sponsors or if it otherwise violates the policies of Sponsors, or if entrants do not follow the directions of Sponsors at all times. These Official Rules and the Contest itself are neither a contract nor an application for employment.</p><p><strong>SELECTION AND NOTIFICATION OF FINALISTS AND GRAND PRIZE WINNERS</strong>: There will be two (2) rounds of judging: Round 1: Initial Judging to Determine the Finalists; and Round 2: Final Judging to Determine the Grand Prize Winners.</p><p><strong>Round 1: Initial Judging for the Finalists</strong>: On June 2, 2014 at or about 7:30 AM ET, one (1) or more qualified judges selected by Sponsors (“Initial Judges”) will review all eligible Entries received during the Contest Period and select five (5) finalists (each a “Finalist”) based on the following initial judging criteria (“Initial Judging Criteria”): Creativity (50%) and Originality (50%). Each Finalist will advance to Round 2: Final Judging to Determine the Grand Prize Winners, subject to verification of eligibility. The selection and review process may occur on a rolling basis as Entries are received. In the event of a tie, the Initial Judges will break the tie by selecting the tied entrant who received the highest points from the Initial Judges for Originality to advance to Round 2: Final Judging to Determine the Grand Prize Winners. In the event a tie remains, an additional tie-breaking judge will judge the tied Entries, using the Initial Judging Criteria, to determine which of the tied Entries will advance to Round 2: Final Judging to Determine the Grand Prize Winners. Sponsors reserve the right to pick fewer than five (5) Finalists (or none at all) or to extend the Contest Entry Period if the Contest does not receive a sufficient number of eligible and qualified Entries, as determined by Sponsors in their sole discretion. </p><p><strong>Round 2: Final Judging to Determine Grand Prize Winners:</strong> On June 2, 2014, immediately following the Round 1: Initial Judging for the Finalists, one (1) or more qualified judges selected by Sponsors (“Final Judges”) will review the Entries of Finalists and select two (2) grand prize winners (“Grand Prize Winner” or “Grand Prize Winners”) based on the following final judging criteria (“Final Judging Criteria”): Originality (50%) and Creativity (50%). In the event of a tie, the Final Judges will break the tie by selecting the tied entrant who received the highest points from the Final Judges for Originality as the potential Grand Prize Winner. In the event a tie remains, an additional tie-breaking judge will judge the tied Entries, using the Final Judging Criteria, to determine which of the tied Entries will be the Grand Prize Winner, subject to verification of eligibility. The three (3) Finalists not selected as Grand Prize Winners will each be named a first prize winner (“First Prize Winner” or “First Prize Winners”). Grand Prize Winners and First Prize Winners, or if Grand Prize Winner or First Prize Winner is a minor in his or her state of residence, his/her parent or legal guardian, will be required to sign an Affidavit of Eligibility, Waiver of Liability, and, except where prohibited, Publicity Release (collectively, “Contest Documents”) on the same day of such notification. Noncompliance within this time period will result in disqualification. If the potential Grand Prize Winner or First Prize Winner cannot be reached or if he/she is found ineligible, if he/she cannot or does not comply with the foregoing requirements and these Official Rules, if his/her Prize or Prize notification is returned as undeliverable, or if it does not satisfactorily execute all of the Contest Documents, potential Winner will be disqualified and Sponsors will award the Prize (defined below) to another Finalist.            </p><p><strong>PRIZE:</strong>  Prizes will be awarded as follows:</p><p><strong>First Prize:</strong> There will be three (3) first prizes (each a “First Prize” and collectively “First Prizes”) awarded, with one First Prize to each First Prize Winner. Each First Prize will consist of the following: one (1) copy of the book <em>The Fault in Our Stars</em>, signed by John Green. First Prize will be awarded “as is” with no warranty or guarantee, either express or implied by Sponsors. Estimated Retail Value (“ERV”) of each First Prize is twelve dollars and ninety-nine cents ($12.99).
