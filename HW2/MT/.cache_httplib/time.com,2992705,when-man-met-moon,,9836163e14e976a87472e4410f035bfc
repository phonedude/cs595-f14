    <aside class="right-rail-module rr-taboola-video" data-name="rr-taboola-video"><div id="taboola-right-rail-organic-video-2992705" class="taboola" data-mode="verticalx3" data-placement="right-rail-organic" data-type="video"></div></aside><p class="p1">There&rsquo;s always something grandiose about gazing back across the gulf of history. Today, we know so much about what was to come, and the people of the past knew so very little. It&rsquo;s impossible to read through TIME&#8217;s July 25, 1969 issue&mdash;which was released 45 years ago this week, will be re-released in full on Time&#8217;s tablet edition next week and featured the epochal Apollo 11 moon-landing on its cover&mdash;and not indulge in some of that generational smugness. There is the good-news story about a lull in the fighting in Vietnam&mdash;a story that feels a lot less good when you know that the war would drag on for six more years and kill more than 15,000 additional American soldiers. There was the laudatory profile of Attorney General John Mitchell, the man nicknamed &ldquo;Nixon&rsquo;s heavyweight,&rdquo; who would later come to be known less nobly as inmate number 24171-157, serving 19 months in prison for his part in the Watergate scandal.</p>

(Answer: yes, sort of, eventually.) There was the speculation over what effect the Chappaquiddick accident, which occurred the same week as the moon landing, would have on Teddy Kennedy&rsquo;s &ldquo;nationwide constituency,&rdquo; polite code for his Presidential prospects. (Answer: a bad one.) The folly of &ldquo;the appestat,&rdquo; the future of the computer, the bloody arc of Vietnam were all part of the unknowable future to the people of then and are just lines in the historical archives to the people of now.</p>
<p class="p1">But here&rsquo;s the thing about those people, the ones who opened that edition of TIME two generations ago&mdash;that paper edition with its adhesive mailing label and its Louis Glansman acrylic painting of Neil Armstrong on the cover, which was the best color image of the moonwalk available since the Apollo 11 crew had not yet returned home with their hand-carried rolls of film that would still have to be taken to the lab for processing and then hand-distributed or sent by wire to the world: those people belonged to an age that could put human beings on the moon and you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p class="p1">They had achieved that momentous feat just days before TIME&#8217;s issue hit the stands and would do it again and again and again and again. They had gone from a standing start on a spit of land in eastern Florida in 1961 to the Sea of Tranquility in 1969, not only proving that the damned thing could be done, not only besting the Russians, who had long led the Space Race&mdash;the great meme of that pre-meme age&mdash;but making a war-torn, race-torn nation that had every reason to feel very, very bad about itself, feel, at least briefly, very, very good.</p>
<p class="p1">That the giddy forecasts that followed the mission never materialized&mdash;the boot prints on Mars in 1982, the 12-person space stations (&ldquo;including the first American spacewoman,&rdquo; TIME reported) by the 1970s&mdash;does nothing to diminish the thing that did happen. That thing happened two generations ago this summer, and it kept happening until 1972, when American astronauts left the moon for the last time&mdash;and for what has turned out to be a very long time. So hat tip to you, people of 1969; maybe we&rsquo;ll grow up to be just like you.</p>

Today, we know so much about what was to come, and the people of the past knew so very little. It&rsquo;s impossible to read through TIME&#8217;s July 25, 1969 issue&mdash;which was released 45 years ago this week, will be re-released in full on Time&#8217;s tablet edition next week and featured the epochal Apollo 11 moon-landing on its cover&mdash;and not indulge in some of that generational smugness. There is the good-news story about a lull in the fighting in Vietnam&mdash;a story that feels a lot less good when you know that the war would drag on for six more years and kill more than 15,000 additional American soldiers. There was the laudatory profile of Attorney General John Mitchell, the man nicknamed &ldquo;Nixon&rsquo;s heavyweight,&rdquo; who would later come to be known less nobly as inmate number 24171-157, serving 19 months in prison for his part in the Watergate scandal.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-partner\" data-name=\"rr-partner\"><div class=\"read-more-list\"><h6 class=\"read-more-list-h\">More<\/h6><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3423985\/india-mars-orbiter-mission-mangalyaan-mom-modi-indian-space-research-organization-isro\/\" class=\"read-more-list-article\" data-event=\"rr-more\">India Has Sent a Spacecraft Into Mars Orbit<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3403740\/jeff-bezos-space-amazon\/\" class=\"read-more-list-article\" data-event=\"rr-more\">Amazon&#8217;s Jeff Bezos: Space Case<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/news\/world\/mount-ontake-erupts-japanese-volcano-rescuers-find-31-hikers-presumed-n213341?cid=par-time_20140928\" class=\"read-more-partner-article\" data-event=\"rr-partner\" target=\"_blank\">No Pulse: Volcano Rescuers Find 31 Hikers Presumed Dead <span>NBC News<\/span><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/storyline\/isis-terror\/airstrikes-hit-isis-controlled-oil-refinery-syria-n213421?cid=par-time_20140928\" class=\"read-more-partner-article\" data-event=\"rr-partner\" target=\"_blank\">Continued Onslaught: Airstrikes Hit ISIS Oil Refinery <span>NBC News<\/span><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/storyline\/michael-brown-shooting\/ferguson-missouri-police-officer-shot-saturday-evening-n213326?cid=par-time_20140928\" class=\"read-more-partner-article\" data-event=\"rr-partner\" target=\"_blank\">Ferguson Police Officer Is Shot, Suspect at Large <span>NBC News<\/span><\/a><\/div><\/aside><p class=\"p1\">There were the ads too&mdash;for sugar as a diet food (it can &ldquo;turn your appestat back to low&rdquo;), for Marlboro Longhorn 100&#8217;s, for RCA&rsquo;s Octoputer, a computer mainframe that &ldquo;works from way over here where you are to way over there where it is.&rdquo; There was the story about the European Common Market, and the question of whether it would ever lead to a true European Union. (Answer: yes, sort of, eventually.) There was the speculation over what effect the Chappaquiddick accident, which occurred the same week as the moon landing, would have on Teddy Kennedy&rsquo;s &ldquo;nationwide constituency,&rdquo; polite code for his Presidential prospects. (Answer: a bad one.) The folly of &ldquo;the appestat,&rdquo; the future of the computer, the bloody arc of Vietnam were all part of the unknowable future to the people of then and are just lines in the historical archives to the people of now.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But here&rsquo;s the thing about those people, the ones who opened that edition of TIME two generations ago&mdash;that paper edition with its adhesive mailing label and its Louis Glansman acrylic painting of Neil Armstrong on the cover, which was the best color image of the moonwalk available since the Apollo 11 crew had not yet returned home with their hand-carried rolls of film that would still have to be taken to the lab for processing and then hand-distributed or sent by wire to the world: those people belonged to an age that could put human beings on the moon and you don&rsquo;t.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">They had achieved that momentous feat just days before TIME&#8217;s issue hit the stands and would do it again and again and again and again. They had gone from a standing start on a spit of land in eastern Florida in 1961 to the Sea of Tranquility in 1969, not only proving that the damned thing could be done, not only besting the Russians, who had long led the Space Race&mdash;the great meme of that pre-meme age&mdash;but making a war-torn, race-torn nation that had every reason to feel very, very bad about itself, feel, at least briefly, very, very good.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">That the giddy forecasts that followed the mission never materialized&mdash;the boot prints on Mars in 1982, the 12-person space stations (&ldquo;including the first American spacewoman,&rdquo; TIME reported) by the 1970s&mdash;does nothing to diminish the thing that did happen. That thing happened two generations ago this summer, and it kept happening until 1972, when American astronauts left the moon for the last time&mdash;and for what has turned out to be a very long time. So hat tip to you, people of 1969; maybe we&rsquo;ll grow up to be just like you.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><div class=\"galleryContainer galleryContainer--embedded\" data-gallery=\"2993486\"

class=\"read-more-inline-title\">Obama Voices Concerns on Police Militarization in Wake of Ferguson<\/h3><\/a><\/div><\/aside><p>President Barack Obama said Saturday that the shooting of an unarmed black teenager in Ferguson, Mo. last month exposed the &#8220;gulf of mistrust&#8221; that exists between law enforcement and local residents in many communities.<\/p>\n<p>Speaking at the Congressional Black Caucus awards dinner, the President said that the shooting of Michael Brown by a police officer in the St Louis suburb &#8220;awakened our nation once again to the reality that people in this room have long understood, which is, in too many communities around the country, a gulf of mistrust exists between local residents and law enforcement.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"a\"><span class=\"l8\"><span class=\"l9\">Statistically, the President noted, blacks in the United States are targeted at a substantially higher rate than whites in their cars and on the street, and more likely to get the death penalty. &#8220;To<span class=\"a\">o many young men of color feel targeted by law e<\/span><span class=\"a\">nforcement, guilty of walking while black, or driving <\/span><span class=\"a\">while black, judged by stereotypes that fuel fear and <\/span><span class=\"a\">resentment <span class=\"l8\">and <span class=\"l9\">hopelessness.&#8221;<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"a\">&#8220;And that has a corrosive effect&mdash;not just on the <\/span><span class=\"a\">black <span class=\"l6\">community; it <span class=\"l11\">has <span class=\"l6\">a <span class=\"l6\">corrosive effect <span class=\"l11\">on America,&#8221; Obama continued.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"a\">To reverse the widening gap between minority communities and the people who police them, said Obama, &#8220;we need to help communities and law <\/span><span class=\"a\">enforcement build trust, build understanding, so that our <\/span><span class=\"a\">neighborhoods stay safe and our young people stay on <\/span><span class=\"a\">track.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Obama&#8217;s remarks Saturday came nearly two months after the shooting of Brown sparked a week of sometimes violent protests in Ferguson and outrage around the country at the local police&#8217;s handling of the situation.<\/p>\n<p>You can read the speech below:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<form

It was originally slated to begin Wednesday, but an aligned student demonstration Friday gathered such momentum that its leaders brought the launch forward.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;We want to help the students achieve their goals,&rdquo; Benny Tai, a founder of Occupy Central, told TIME on Sunday morning. &ldquo;They want to stay here, and we want to support them.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>On Sunday afternoon, protesters brandishing umbrellas repeatedly charged at lines of riot police in front of Government House, only to be repelled by volleys of pepper spray. The protesters then retreated to regroup and rushed again. Each time, the cache of mangled umbrellas behind the police grew larger. As tensions rose, tear gas was fired at the crowd in Harcourt Road. Dozens of police and protesters were injured in the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;They needed to do something to control the scene, so they needed to shoot the gas,&#8221; a police spokesman told TIME. &#8220;[The protests] are not good for ordinary people.&#8221; Late Sunday evening, officers held banners aloft that read &#8220;disperse or we will fire&#8221; as rumors swirled of rubber bullets being readied.<\/p>\n<p>Hong Kong has been run under a &ldquo;one country, two systems&rdquo; since British colonial rule ended in 1997. Beijing had promised to let residents choose the city&rsquo;s Chief Executive, the tellingly corporate title of the top job in this bastion of free enterprise, by 2017, but now insists that all candidates must first be vetted by a committee perceived as curated by the Chinese Community Party.<\/p>\n<p>Hong Kong&rsquo;s democracy activists see this as a betrayal; Beijing retorts that the Special Administrative Region already enjoys considerable autonomy and lacks patriotism.<\/p>\n<p>Current Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying, a polarizing figure largely seen as loyal to the mainland, told reporters Sunday that Hong Kong was &#8220;not a self-contained democracy.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Any fair-minded person will come to the conclusion that the method of electing the Chief Executive in 2017 is more democratic,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is not ideal, but it is better.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>On Saturday, a public square attached to the government headquarters was stormed by students, and at least 74 people were arrested. That protest swelled to upwards of 50,000 people, according to organizers, congregating in the austere, concrete flanking areas.<\/p>\n<p>Hong Kong Police Commissioner Andy Tsang Wai-Hung defended his officers&#8217; handling of the student protests when speaking with media Sunday. &#8220;Even after considering the protesters were unarmed, I believe it is important to consider that many others were injured as a result of their acts,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>On Sunday afternoon, several democratic legislators were arrested for &ldquo;obstructing police in the detainment of audio equipment&rdquo; at one of the steel barriers, according to the Hong Kong Student Federation. That same organization donned black T-shirts with the English phrase, in green letters, &#8220;Freedom Now!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Layla Chang, an 18-year-old university student, said she didn&#8217;t feel she could leave the main protest site even if she tried, since the police had blocking all entrances and exits, and the throngs have amassed to intractable numbers outside. &#8220;We are very afraid but we can&#8217;t leave now,&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n<p>Early on, the sprawl had a typically Hong Kong sense of order, with volunteers organizing the collection and sorting of waste, and medical groups erecting tents to treat protestors for exhaustion and pepper spray. Plastic wrap, to guard against the latter, was doled out by the protest organizers.<\/p>\n<p>In a surreal scene, at a park just a few hundred yards from the protests, a small group of elderly folk listened to mandarin songs celebrating the coming 65th anniversary of the founding of the People&#8217;s Republic of China.<\/p>\n<p>On Sunday morning, protesters caught quick naps under the shade of blue and red tents and hunted for snacks in the piles of bread, bananas, cookies and water that volunteers had dropped off. Yellow ribbons, a longstanding symbol of demands for universal suffrage, were wound around police barricades. At one, dozens of umbrellas were fanned to protect against the use of pepper spray.<\/p>\n<p>Audrey Eu, chairman of the Civic Party, a leading democratic party in Hong Kong, told TIME that though she thought it &ldquo;unlikely&rdquo; Beijing would reverse its position on the 2017 elections, the protests would go a long way toward galvanizing pro-democracy sentiment and heralding future change. &#8220;This is a broad-based movement,&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;The people of Hong Kong need to stand up and defend one country, two systems,&rdquo; she said by a police barricade, protective ski goggles perched on her head. She had brought her sleeping bag for a possible &#8220;long wait.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m prepared to be arrested,&rdquo; Jimmy Lai, a prominent Hong Kong publisher and critic of the Beijing government, told reporters, as he sat down in front of a row of police on Sunday morning, wearing a plastic white raincoat and pair of goggles.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;If you persist in resistance, there is always hope,&rdquo; he told TIME. &ldquo;If you give up, there is no hope.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Gemma Yim, 21, a university student sitting behind Lai, said she was not prepared to go home anytime soon and would stay at least until all those demonstrators arrested Saturday were released.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We just want to go step by step,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Right now, I don&#8217;t know what we can do but go on strike.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The unrest continued late into Sunday evening and spread to different parts of the city. Along with democracy slogans, those present sung songs by legendary 1980s Hong Kong rock band <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=TIeTcFgdd_4\" target=\"_blank\">Beyond<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>At around 8 p.m., police announced they had released Joshua Wong, the leader of the Scholarism student activist group, who was arrested Friday for his role in the earlier disturbances. The 17-year-old vowed to join the demonstrations after taking a shower and rest at home.<\/p>\n<p><em>&mdash;With reporting by Zoher Abdoolcarim\/Hong Kong, David Stout\/Hong Kong and Rishi Iyengar\/Hong Kong<\/em><\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text\/html' width='640' height='390' src='http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/w4q8fs8gTIs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'><\/iframe><\/div>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3439242\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"World","slug":"world","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/world\/","description":"The latest news and analysis from TIME's correspondents on world politics, diplomacy, conflict, culture, humanitarian disasters, religion and much more"},"tag":{"name":"Hong Kong","slug":"hong-kong","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tag\/hong-kong\/"},"tags":"China|democracy|Hong Kong|Ocuppy Central","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/rtr48081.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/rtr48081.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/rtr48081.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/rtr48081.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/rtr48081.jpg?w=1100"},"credit":"Tyrone Siu\u2014Reuters","caption":"Riot policemen (L) use pepper spray during clash with protesters, as tens of thousands of protesters block the main street to the financial Central district outside the government headquarters in Hong Kong, September 28, 2014.

He said the officer returned fire but said police have &#8220;no indication&#8221; that either suspect was shot.<\/p>\n<p>A search was underway for the suspects early Sunday in Ferguson, where some community members remain uneasy in the wake of the August shooting death of an unarmed black 18-year-old by a white police officer.<\/p>\n<p>Belmar said he did not think the officer&#8217;s shooting was related to two separate protests about Michael Brown&#8217;s shooting that were going on Saturday night around the same time.<\/p>\n<p>Around midnight at the police station, approximately two dozen officers stood near a group of about 100 protesters who mingled on a street corner, occasionally shouting, &#8220;No justice; no peace.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Nearby, part of a road was closed in town as police conducted a search for the suspects. Numerous law enforcement agencies were responding, and police helicopters were canvassing the area.<\/p>\n<p>The officer&#8217;s shooting comes after Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson issued a videotaped apology to Brown&#8217;s family earlier in the week and attempted to march with protesters, an effort that led to a clash with activists and several arrests on Thursday.<\/p>\n<p>Brown&#8217;s parents told The Associated Press on Saturday they were unmoved by the apology.<\/p>\n<p>Brown&#8217;s mother, Lesley McSpadden, said, &#8220;yes,&#8221; when asked if Jackson should be fired, and his father, Michael Brown Sr., said rather than an apology, they would like to see the officer who shot their son arrested.<\/p>\n<p>A county grand jury is weighing whether to indict Ferguson officer Darren Wilson in Brown&#8217;s shooting.<\/p>\n<p>The Justice Department, which is investigating whether Brown&#8217;s civil rights were violated, is conducting a broader probe into Ferguson police. On Friday, it urged Jackson to ban his officers from wearing bracelets supporting Wilson while on duty and from covering up their name plates with black tape.<\/p>\n<p>Ferguson residents complained about the bracelets, which are black with &#8220;I am Darren Wilson&#8221; in white lettering, at a meeting with federal officials this week.<\/p>\n<p>Brown&#8217;s shooting has also focused attention on the lack of diversity in many police departments across the country. In Ferguson, of 53 officers in a community that is two-thirds black, only three are African-American.<\/p>\n<p>Also early Sunday, not far from Ferguson, an off-duty St. Louis city police officer was injured on Interstate 70 when three suspects fired shots into his personal vehicle, a police spokeswoman said.<\/p>\n<p>Schron Jackson said the officer, who has nearly 20 years of experience, was being treated at a hospital for a minor injury to his arm from broken glass. She said there is no reason to believe the two shootings were related.<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3441507\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"U.S.","slug":"us","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/us\/","description":"The latest news and analysis on crime, religion, education, transportation, weather, immigration, sports, drugs, the law, and other news from around the nation"},"topic":{"name":"Ferguson","slug":"ferguson","left_rail_title":"Ferguson","left_rail_subhead":"More Ferguson Coverage","editor_content":"","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/topic\/ferguson\/","email_title":"Ferguson | TIME","email_body":"Ferguson%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2Ftopic%2Fferguson%2F","encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F%2F2992705%2Fwhen-man-met-moon%2F","encoded_shortlink":"","twitter_text":"","encoded_title":"Ferguson"},"tag":{"name":"Crime","slug":"crime","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tag\/crime\/"},"tags":"Crime","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"http:\/\/i0.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/fergusoon-police-shot.jpg?crop=1347px%2C324px%2C583px%2C583px&resize=100%2C100","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/fergusoon-police-shot.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/fergusoon-police-shot.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/fergusoon-police-shot.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/fergusoon-police-shot.jpg?w=1100"},"credit":"Christian Gooden\u2014AP","caption":"Missouri State Highway Patrol troopers stand posted at the corner of Chambers Road and West Florissant Avenue on Sept. 27, 2014, in Ferguson, Mo., as police search for a suspect in the shooting of a Ferguson police officer.

Ortega-Hernandez, fired at least seven bullets into the house&#8217;s upstairs residence 700 yards across the South Lawn, and to the attack.<\/p>\n<p>President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama were away during that weekend, but their younger daughter, Sasha, was in the White House, the <em>Post<\/em> reports, and their older daughter, Malia, was expected home any minute.<\/p>\n<p>While Secret Service officers rushed to respond to the shots, a call came from the supervisor on duty: no shots fired, stand down. The officers complied, even as Ortega sped away from the scene at 60 mph. The supervisor apparently believed the noise had been a construction vehicle backfiring.<\/p>\n<p>Although it acknowledged later that night that shots had been fired in the vicinity, the agency initially suggested they had come from a gang gunfight near the front lawn of the White House, and not from a deliberate attack.<\/p>\n<p>It took more than four days for the Secret Service to piece together that shots had hit the White House, and only then because a housekeeper noticed the damage. The Secret Service did not interview key witnesses until days later, when the bullets were found, and only conducted a superficial inspection of the White House for damage.<\/p>\n<p>The Obamas were only made aware of the shooting when an assistant White House usher told the First Lady about the bullet holes another housekeeper had found. The officers who believed shots had hit the White House were either ignored or afraid to contradict their superiors.<\/p>\n<p>Ortega was eventually arrested and sentenced to 25 years in prison.

He said the jihadi fighters later shelled the town, wounding a number of civilians.<\/p>\n<p>The United States and five Arab allies launched an aerial campaign against Islamic State fighters in Syria early Tuesday with the aim of rolling back and ultimately crushing the extremist group, which has created a proto-state spanning the Syria-Iraq border. Along the way, the militants have massacred captured Syrian and Iraqi troops, terrorized minorities in both countries and beheaded two American journalists and a British aid worker.<\/p>\n<p>The latest airstrikes came as Syria&#8217;s Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem told the Lebanon-based Al-Mayadeen TV that airstrikes alone &#8220;will not be able wipe out&#8221; the Islamic State group. Speaking from New York where he is attending the U.N. General Assembly, al-Moallem said in remarks broadcast Saturday that the U.S. should work with Damascus if it wants to win the war.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;They must know the importance of coordination with the people of this country because they know what goes on there,&#8221; al-Moallem said. The U.S. has ruled out any coordination with President Bashar Assad&#8217;s government, which is at war with the Islamic State group as well as Western-backed rebels.<\/p>\n<p>The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the coalition&#8217;s strikes near Kobani came amid heavy fighting between the Islamic State group and members of the Kurdish force known as the People&#8217;s Protection Units, or YPK.<\/p>\n<p>The Britain-based group, which relies on activists inside Syria, had no immediate word on casualties from Saturday&#8217;s strikes. The Observatory reported Friday that 13 civilians have been killed by the strikes since they began.<\/p>\n<p>Kurdish fighter Majid Goran told the Associated Press by telephone from Kobani that two bombs were dropped over the nearby village of Ali Shar, at 6 a.m. (0300 GMT), but that the positions they struck were empty.<\/p>\n<p>Turkey&#8217;s Dogan news agency reported Saturday that the sound of heavy fighting could be heard from the Turkish border village of Karaca. The agency said Kurdish forces retook some positions they had lost to the Islamic militants a few days ago. It did not cite a source for the report.<\/p>\n<p>Dozens of people wounded in the fighting arrived in Turkey for treatment on Saturday, it said.<\/p>\n<p>Another Kurdish fighter, Ismet Sheikh Hasan, said the Turkish military on Saturday night retaliated after stray shells landed on Turkish territory, firing in the Ali Shar region. He said the Turkish action left Kurdish fighters in the middle of the crossfire.<\/p>\n<p>He said that on Friday, the Islamic militants were attacking the Kobani area from the east with tanks and artillery, advancing on Ali Shar and Haja. He said some 20 people were killed, including Kurdish fighters and civilians, while another 50 people were wounded.<\/p>\n<p>The fighting around Kobani sparked one of the largest single outflows of refugees since Syria&#8217;s conflict began more than three years ago. The Syrian Kurdish forces have long been one of the most effective fighting units battling the Islamic State, but the tide has turned in recent weeks as the Islamic militants have attacked with heavy weapons likely looted from neighboring Iraq.<\/p>\n<p>The Observatory said other coalition airstrikes targeted Islamic State compounds in the central province of Homs and the northern regions of Raqqa and Aleppo. The group said 31 explosions were heard in the city of Raqqa, the group&#8217;s de facto capital, and its suburbs.<\/p>\n<p>The Local Coordination Committees, another activist group, said the strikes in the east hit the province of Deir el-Zour as well as Raqqa. The LCC also said the coalition targeted grain silos west of Deir el-Zour city.<\/p>\n<p>It was not immediately clear why the silos were targeted.<\/p>\n<p>Max Blumenfeld, a spokesman for U.S. Central Command, said the U.S. airstrikes &#8220;don&#8217;t target food or anything else than can be used by the civilian population.&#8221; But he said that until the military reviews images from planes that participated in the strikes, he could not rule out that silos were hit.<\/p>\n<p>He said the airstrikes are aimed at specific Islamic State targets such as command and control centers, transportation and logistics, and oil refineries, &#8220;but not food that could have an impact upon the civilian population.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Our targets are structures that combatants would use,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>In recent days coalition warplanes had struck oil-producing facilities in eastern Syria in a bid to cut off one of the Islamic State group&#8217;s main revenue streams &mdash; black market oil sales that the U.S. says generate up to $2 million a day.<\/p>\n<p>The coalition striking Syria includes Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain and Jordan, and the strikes are an extension of the U.S. campaign in neighboring Iraq launched in August.<\/p>\n<p>Near the capital Damascus, Syrian troops meanwhile entered the once rebel-held northeastern suburb of Adra after days of clashes, Syrian state TV said. The advance came two days after troops captured the nearby Adra industrial zone.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3437245\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"World","slug":"world","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/world\/","description":"The latest news and analysis from TIME's correspondents on world politics, diplomacy, conflict, culture, humanitarian disasters, religion and much more"},"tag":{"name":"Syria","slug":"syria","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tag\/syria\/"},"tags":"Syria","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/syrian-refugees-isis.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/syrian-refugees-isis.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/syrian-refugees-isis.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/syrian-refugees-isis.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/syrian-refugees-isis.jpg?w=1100"},"credit":"Bulent Kilic\u2014AFP\/Getty Images","caption":"Syrian Kurdish boys, fleeing an onslaught by ISIS, sit in a truck as they cross the Syria Turkey border at the southeastern town of Suruc in Sanliurfa province, on Sept. 27, 2014.

San Francisco District Attorney George Gascon said 26-year-old Patrick Karajua pleaded not guilty to the hammer attack.<\/p>\n<p>The charges come just days after the Gascon and the Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey warned Uber, Lyft and Sidecar that they are <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3431299\/san-francisco-los-angeles-threaten-shut-down-uber-lyft\/\" target=\"_blank\">operating illegally<\/a> and could face civil penalties.

Clarke&#8217;s to heart: &#8220;any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Inspired in part by the famous Invisibility Cloak from Harry Potter, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rochester.edu\/newscenter\/watch-rochester-cloak-uses-ordinary-lenses-to-hide-objects-across-continuous-range-of-angles-70592\/\" target=\"_blank\">scientists at Rochester<\/a> have discovered new ways to use complex lenses to hide objects from view. While previous cloaking devices distort the background and make it apparent that an object is being cloaked, the four lenses used at Rochester keep an object hidden as the viewer moves up to several degrees away.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;This is the first device that we know of that can do three-dimensional, continuously multidirectional cloaking, which works for transmitting rays in the visible spectrum,&rdquo; said Joseph Choi, a PhD student at Rochester&rsquo;s Institute of Optics who is working with physics professor Joseph Howell at the university.<\/p>\n<p>While the lenses do truly disguise the image of an object, scientists aren&#8217;t claiming a suit-sized version of the lens will work, much less help its wearers sneak past Death Eaters or into a Room of Requirement.<\/p>\n<p>But there are practical uses for the technology: Howell says that the lenses could help a surgeon &ldquo;look through his hands to what he is actually operating on,&#8221; and the lenses could be applied to a truck to allow drivers to see through blind spots on their vehicles.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a video that shows in more detail how the lenses work:<\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-pos=\"9\"><object id=\"bc-video-3810439617001-9\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#000000\"><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"1847503743001\"><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/wp.me\/p5HMd-ero7\"><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"TIME_onTemplateLoad\"><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"TIME_onTemplateReady\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"><param name=\"htmlFallback\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"3810439617001\"><\/object><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3441875\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"Science","slug":"science","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/science\/","description":"The latest news and commentary from TIME on the world of science, including the environment, space, biology, paleontology, physics, natural disasters and more"},"tag":{"name":"Physics","slug":"physics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tag\/physics\/"},"tags":"Physics","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/invisibility-cloak.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/invisibility-cloak.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/invisibility-cloak.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/invisibility-cloak.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/invisibility-cloak.jpg?w=1100"},"credit":"Reuters","caption":"A cloaking device using four lenses developed by University of Rochester physics professor John Howell and graduate student Joseph Choi is demonstrated in Rochester, New York on Sept. 11, 2014.","alt":"Handout photo of cloaking device using four lenses developed by University of Rochester physics professor Howell and graduate student Choi is demonstrated in Rochester"},"id":3441875,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3441875%2Finvisibility-cloak-harry-potter-lens-rochester%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fp5HMd-ero7","encoded_title":"This+Discovery+Brings+Us+One+Step+Closer+to+Harry+Potter%E2%80%99s+Invisibility+Cloak","twitter_text":"This%20discovery%20brings%20us%20one%20step%20closer%20to%20Harry%20Potter%27s%20invisibility%20cloak","twitter_via":"TIME","ads":{"neg":"false","post_title":"This Discovery Brings Us One Step Closer to Harry Potter's Invisibility Cloak"},"Partner_Module":{"partner":"Select","post_title":"This Discovery Brings Us One Step Closer to Harry Potter's Invisibility Cloak"},"email_title":"This%20Discovery%20Brings%20Us%20One%20Step%20Closer%20to%20Harry%20Potter%E2%80%99s%20Invisibility%20Cloak%20%7C%20TIME","email_body":"This%20Discovery%20Brings%20Us%20One%20Step%20Closer%20to%20Harry%20Potter%E2%80%99s%20Invisibility%20Cloak%0A%0AIt%27s%20like%20a%20very%20small%20invisibility%20cloak%20made%20of%20glass%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3441875%2Finvisibility-cloak-harry-potter-lens-rochester%2F","omniture":{"modules":"rr-taboola-video|rr-ad"}},{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/3438643\/chris-pratt-hosts-snl-best-worst-and-weirdest-moments\/","shortlink":"http:\/\/wp.me\/p5HMd-eqxZ","title":"Chris Pratt Hosts <i>SNL<\/i>: Best, Worst, and Weirdest Moments","post_type":"post","time_article":true,"comments_allowed":true,"short_title":"SNL Recap: Chris Pratt Good, Writing Bad","excerpt":"Host Chris Pratt lacked good material, but not enthusiasm","format":"article","time":{"pretty":"10:42 AM ET","published":"2014-09-28 10:42:15","updated":"2014-09-28 14:42:15","minute":"10:42 am","short":"10:42 AM ET"},"authors":[{"id":277775394,"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/author\/adam-carlson\/","name":"Adam Carlson","bio":"","short_bio":"","types":["contributor"],"twitter":"acarlson91","twitter_url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/acarlson91","gplus":"","fb":"","email":"","thumbnail":null,"contributor":false}],"content":"<p>Here is a question that I didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d have to ask: Did anyone at <em>Saturday Night Live<\/em> know who Chris Pratt was before he agreed to host last night?<\/p>\n<p>The season premiere, <em>SNL<\/em>&#8216;s 40th, played way more to the <em>idea<\/em> of Pratt (handsome, open-minded blockbuster-er) than to his human Slinky strengths, which kept being hidden behind wigs, like the wigs were the joke.

It&#8217;s a joke that&#8217;s easy to over-explain, but funniest &mdash; like here &mdash; in endless variation.<\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\"><iframe width='512' height='288' src='http:\/\/www.hulu.com\/embed.html?eid=donqsau1bfalcoarn9nvnq' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p><strong>The worst sketch <\/strong>was the second of the night, which saw toys brought to life by a young boy&#8217;s wish, like <em>Toy Story<\/em> only with loincloths and genitalia. And I do mean <em>only<\/em> those things. Taran Killam, as <em>ThunderCats <\/em>leader Lion-O, discovered the joys of cake and self-pleasure. Pratt, as He-Man, swung his sword and kept swinging and then smashed through a kitchen wall in pursuit of a teenage girl. The sketch had the night&#8217;s first Ariana Grande appearance, as He-Man&#8217;s twin sister, She-Ra. (She was definitely there! Is the thing that you can say about it to all of your friends.)<\/p>\n<p><b>The weirdest sketch <\/b>came late in the episode, as they almost always do, this one more thought experiment than pay-off. Imagine: Everyone on <em>Friends <\/em>had been swapped out with the cast of Lifetime&#8217;s TV movie <em>The Unauthorized Saved by the Bell Story &mdash; <\/em>and you&#8217;d be about halfway there. Pratt, et al. played three roommates driven apart when Pratt is seduced into a dark friendship with a group of young boys. Everything is styled and shot like a classic, learn-your-lesson sitcom of the &#8217;80s and &#8217;90s.<\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\"><iframe width='512' height='288' src='http:\/\/www.hulu.com\/embed.html?eid=yhaqczeds5vjcejfww9x8w' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<h3>Other Things<\/h3>\n<p><strong><em>Weekend Update<\/em> <\/strong>returned with a new co-host, Michael Che, alongside head writer\/and more Colin Jost. The segment lacked for zingers but not cast members, bringing in Cecily Strong, Pete Davidson, and Leslie Jones as <em>&mdash;<\/em> respectively <em>&mdash; <\/em>experts on Ebola, teens, and singledom. Bringing back Strong, Che&#8217;s talented predecessor in the <i>Update <\/i>chair, so quickly could have been just a make-nice moment, but she&#8217;s too funny away from the desk not to use.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Don Pardo<\/strong>, SNL&#8217;s longtime announcer, who died in August, was remembered during the episode with a title card and moment of silence.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Ariana Grande <\/strong>sang two songs, with one surprise each: First was &#8220;Break Free,&#8221; which started as a piano-backed cabaret piece before halfway through transforming into its original version, as a full-on Zedd-sterpiece. Her &#8220;Love Me Harder&#8221; nearly ended the episode, with The Weeknd dropping by to duet. (Have you seen his hair lately? We&#8217;ve all been talking and we think you should say something.)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Aidy Bryant <\/strong>was the night&#8217;s workhorse, a crucial part of no fewer than four sketches, including a standout that saw her spitting Nicki Minaj-style come-ons to Pratt, as the object of her affections. (That sketch, playing out a theme for the night, involved more twists and turns than it involved Pratt.) Bryant&#8217;s joke is still usually her volcanic charisma, how her voice is like a roller coaster blowing out syllables into triple entendres, but that isn&#8217;t automatically a bad thing. It&#8217;s a well the show feels inspired to tap.<\/p>\n<h3>If You DVR&#8217;d It<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Skip: <\/strong>The episode&#8217;s NFL jokes, including a Candy Crowley-themed cold open, which took almost 90 minutes to hit anything like humor.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do not skip: <\/strong>new cast member Pete Davidson&#8217;s appearance on <em>Weekend Update<\/em>. As a teen expert called to comment on the recent case of a Pennsylvania boy facing jail time after simulating a lewd act with Jesus statue, Davidson instead plows into a winding digression about the moral economics of fellatio. Bottom line: &#8220;If you don&#8217;t go down on a guy for $1 million, you obviously don&#8217;t care about your family.&#8221;<\/p>\n","section":{"name":"Entertainment","slug":"entertainment","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/entertainment\/","description":"From esoteric art to Housewives hullaballoo, TIME Culture covers what's good, bad and breaking right now in music, movies, TV, tech, celebrities and style"},"tag":{"name":"Television","slug":"television","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tag\/television\/"},"tags":"Television","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/chris-pratt-snl.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/chris-pratt-snl.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/chris-pratt-snl.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/chris-pratt-snl.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/chris-pratt-snl.jpg?w=1100"},"credit":"Dana Edelson\u2014NBC\/Getty Images","caption":"Chris Pratt on Saturday Night Live on Sept. 27, 2014.

No matter which estimate you look at &#8212; the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the International Energy Agency, or Wall Street banks &#8212; two things are clear: the United States is slated to consume enormous amounts of natural gas and the dominant fuel of electricity generation for the last 50 years, coal, is diminishing.<\/p>\n<p>First, America&rsquo;s energy darling: natural gas. It is difficult to overstate the effect shale gas production has had on the United States. In 2006, shale gas production accounted for about 5 percent of natural gas production. In 2013, it accounted for roughly 40 percent. As industry leaders clamored to take advantage of the vast supply of newly accessible domestic natural gas, analysts began to forecast longer and longer projections of low natural gas prices. The result is big expectations for natural gas.<\/p>\n<div id=\"box-premium-reports-free\">\n<div id=\"box-premium-reports-free-top\"><a href=\"http:\/\/oilprice.com\/Energy\/Natural-Gas\/Why-the-Debate-Over-U.S.-LNG-Exports-Has-Been-Won.html\"><strong>Related: Why the Debate Over U.S. LNG Exports Has Been Won<\/strong><\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>The EIA expects natural gas production to grow at a 1.6 percent annual rate from 2012 through 2040, resulting in a dry natural gas production of 23.04 quadrillion BTU in 2013 and a production forecast of 38.37 quadrillion BTU in 2040. Demand will come from residential, commercial, and transportation use, but the largest demand increase will be from the electric power sector, particularly combined cycle power plants. Today, the U.S. has a combined cycle generating capacity of roughly 190 gigawatts. By 2040, capacity is forecasted to increase to approximately 316 gigawatts.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the outlook for coal continues to appear bleak. This week, the Government Accountability Office released a new<a href=\"http:\/\/www.gao.gov\/assets\/670\/665325.pdf\">report<\/a> with increased projections for the number of coal plants expected to retire in the coming years. The report estimates that 42,192 megawatts, or 13 percent of coal-fueled summer generating capacity, will retire between 2012 and 2025 as a result of environmental regulations, lower natural gas prices, and decreasing electricity demand. These retirements are on top of the 150 coal-fueled units with a summer generating capacity of 13,786 megawatts that have been retired since 2000.<\/p>\n<p>America&rsquo;s gamble will not affect everyone in the country equally. Almost 40 percent of the retired coal capacity will take place in in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and West Virginia. Fortunately, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and to a lesser degree West Virginia, have economies that will be better prepared for this transition as a result of surging production from the Marcellus and Utica shale plays.<\/p>\n<p>The story is the same for exports. Last week, the U.S. Energy Department gave the final approval to build two more LNG export terminals.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/oilprice.com\/Energy\/Natural-Gas\/This-Natural-Gas-Giant-Is-Worth-The-Risk-At-These-levels.html\"><strong>Related: This Natural Gas Giant Is Worth The Risk At These levels<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The outlook for coal exports is much different. Last month, Oregon&rsquo;s Department of State Lands <a href=\"http:\/\/www.oregonlive.com\/environment\/index.ssf\/2014\/08\/oregon_department_of_state_lan.html\">denied<\/a> a key permit to Australia-based Ambre Energy to build a coal export terminal on the Columbia River. On Sept. 15, Ambre Energy was dealt another blow when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers denied its appeal. Corps spokesman Scott Clemans said, &ldquo;We could do [the review] and make a yes or no determination, but given the lack of clarity right now as to whether the required state authorization is going to happen, and given the amount of time and energy we still need to devote to this project, it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to devote resources to a project that may not happen.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>For everyone&rsquo;s sake, let&rsquo;s hope the gamble pays off. Because if natural gas fails to live up to the high expectations, there will be less coal to back it up.<\/p>\n<p><strong>More Top Reads From Oilprice.com:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/oilprice.com\/Energy\/Natural-Gas\/Controversial-Proposed-Pipeline-Would-Bring-Shale-Gas-to-North-Carolina.html\"><strong>Controversial Proposed Pipeline Would Bring Shale Gas to North Carolina<\/strong><\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/oilprice.com\/Energy\/Natural-Gas\/LNG-Exporters-Struggling-to-Find-Customers.html\"><strong>LNG Exporters Struggling to Find Customers<\/strong><\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/oilprice.com\/Energy\/Energy-General\/New-Technology-Could-End-The-Debate-Over-Pipeline-Safety.html\"><strong>New Technology Could End The Debate Over Pipeline Safety<\/strong><\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3433259\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"World","slug":"world","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/world\/","description":"The latest news and analysis from TIME's correspondents on world politics, diplomacy, conflict, culture, humanitarian disasters, religion and much more"},"tag":{"name":"energy","slug":"energy","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tag\/energy\/"},"tags":"climate change|coal|Electricity|energy|Natural gas|Pollution|U.S.","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/14-09-26-shale-gas.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/14-09-26-shale-gas.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/14-09-26-shale-gas.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/14-09-26-shale-gas.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/14-09-26-shale-gas.jpg?w=1100"},"credit":"Ty Wright\/Bloomberg via Getty Images","caption":"A shale gas well in Pennsylvania","alt":"Shale gas"},"id":3433259,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3433259%2Famericas-big-bet-on-natural-gas-and-big-short-on-coal%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fp5HMd-ep99","encoded_title":"America%E2%80%99s+Big+Bet+On+Natural+Gas+And+Big+Short+On+Coal","twitter_text":"America%E2%80%99s%20Big%20Bet%20On%20Natural%20Gas%20And%20Big%20Short%20On%20Coal","twitter_via":"TIMEWorld","ads":{"neg":"false","post_title":"America\u2019s Big Bet On Natural Gas And Big Short On Coal"},"Partner_Module":{"partner":"Select","post_title":"America\u2019s Big Bet On Natural Gas And Big Short On Coal"},"email_title":"America%E2%80%99s%20Big%20Bet%20On%20Natural%20Gas%20And%20Big%20Short%20On%20Coal%20%7C%20TIME","email_body":"America%E2%80%99s%20Big%20Bet%20On%20Natural%20Gas%20And%20Big%20Short%20On%20Coal%0A%0AThe%20U.S.%20is%20becoming%20increasingly%20dependent%20on%20natural%20gas%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3433259%2Famericas-big-bet-on-natural-gas-and-big-short-on-coal%2F","omniture":{"modules":"rr-taboola-video|rr-partner|rr-ad"}},{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/3430525\/rolling-stone-pink-floyd-endless-river\/","shortlink":"http:\/\/ti.me\/1suf0qW","title":"Pink Floyd Roll Out Plans For <i>The Endless River<\/i>, First LP in 20 Years","post_type":"post","time_article":true,"comments_allowed":true,"short_title":"Pink Floyd Roll Out Plans For <i>The Endless River<\/i>, First LP in 20 Years","excerpt":"\"'The Endless River' is a tribute to Rick Wright,\" says Nick Mason. \"His playing was at the heart of the Pink Floyd sound\"","format":"article","time":{"pretty":"9:00 AM ET","published":"2014-09-28 09:00:45","updated":"2014-09-28 13:00:45","minute":"9:00 am","short":"9:00 AM ET"},"authors":[{"id":4552,"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/author\/rolling-stone\/","name":"Andy Greene \/ Rolling Stone","bio":"","short_bio":"","types":[],"twitter":"","twitter_url":"","gplus":"","fb":"","email":"","thumbnail":null,"contributor":false}],"content":"<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-taboola-video\" data-name=\"rr-taboola-video\"><div id=\"taboola-right-rail-organic-video-3430525\" class=\"taboola\" data-mode=\"verticalx3\" data-placement=\"right-rail-organic\" data-type=\"video\"><\/div><\/aside><p><em>This post originally appeared on <\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.rollingstone.com\/music\/news\/pink-floyd-roll-out-plans-for-the-endless-river-their-first-lp-in-20-years-20140922\" target=\"_blank\">Rolling Stone<\/a>.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-partner\" data-name=\"rr-partner\"><div class=\"read-more-list\"><h6 class=\"read-more-list-h\">More<\/h6><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3432597\/odesza-say-my-name-star-slinger-remix\/\" class=\"read-more-list-article\" data-event=\"rr-more\">ODESZA&#8217;s &#8220;Say My Name&#8221;

Mercifully, big, costly, splashy events are not the ultimate bliss bringers. As people get older, they tend to find ordinary treats&mdash;such as a latte or a manicure&mdash;just as joy-inducing as extraordinary ones like an around-the-world cruise, found a 2014 study by researchers at Dartmouth and the University of Pennsylvania. With age, the authors speculate, we&#8217;re more aware of how fleeting time is, so we&#8217;re particularly likely to relish everyday bright spots.<\/p>\n<p>What you won&#8217;t find here: a step-by-step happiness guide. How draining would <em>that<\/em> be? Instead, we tapped top positive psychologists for easy ways to infuse your days with more pleasure. Consider this a pick-and-choose list; even doing just a few will help. Ready for more joy? Plan on it!<\/p>\n<p><strong>First up: Make it your goal<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Although increasing happiness levels shouldn&#8217;t feel like work, having a can-do mindset really comes in handy. In a study published in the<em> Journal of Positive Psychology,<\/em> people who were told to listen to music and attempt to feel happier had a greater boost in bliss over a two-week period than those instructed only to relax as they listened to the same upbeat tunes. It comes down to motivation: You can transform into more of a glass-half-full type.<\/p>\n<p>While researchers believe that genetics are behind about 50 percent of the variation in happiness levels among you and your neighbors and that life circumstances account for maybe 10 percent, you&#8217;re fully in charge of the rest. &#8220;A lot of people think you can&#8217;t control happiness&mdash;you either have it or you don&#8217;t&mdash;which is totally not true,&#8221; stresses Sonja Lyubomirsky, PhD, professor of psychology at University of California, Riverside, and author of <em>The Myths of Happiness.<\/em> &#8220;It&#8217;s like controlling your health. First you need to believe that you can do it before you take those first steps.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Know your own bliss<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When was the last time you mulled over what truly brings you pleasure, aside from biggies like your partner and the kids? &#8220;A key to steering your own happiness is reflecting on the things that make you come alive,&#8221; Fredrickson says. Perhaps it&#8217;s been so long since you&#8217;ve done some of them that they&#8217;ve fallen off your radar. Make a list, if it helps. &#8220;Think back to what gave you joy in your younger years,&#8221; says psychiatrist Stuart Brown, MD, founder of the National Institute for Play in Carmel Valley, Calif., and author of <em>Play.<\/em> Maybe you&#8217;re not jamming on a guitar in your bedroom anymore, but &#8220;you can recall the carefree state,&#8221; Dr. Brown says, &#8220;in which the outcome wasn&#8217;t as important as what you were experiencing.&#8221; You want to find what does that for you now and&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8230;Prioritize it<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Sigh if this sounds familiar: You make a major effort to avoid future stress&mdash;say, staying up late to finish laundry so tomorrow will be a better day&mdash;only to suck your evening dry of all fun. Happiness researcher Robert Biswas-Diener, PhD, founder and managing director of the consulting firm Positive Acorn in Milwaukie, Ore., knows this treadmill effect well. He delivers a lecture regularly at Portland State University: &#8220;I give the students an hour off and tell them to do anything they want that&#8217;s legal that will make them happy. Some have a hard time with it&mdash;they even do homework! What they say is, &#8216;I&#8217;d be stressed if I <em>didn&#8217;t<\/em> get that task done.&#8217; People think that working toward less stress will make them happier. That&#8217;s a minor form of insanity.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong><strong>HEALTH.COM<\/strong>: <\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.health.com\/health\/gallery\/0,,20843057,00.html?xid=Time-happiness-092614\"><strong>13 Ways to Beat Stress in 15 Minutes or Less<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<p>In a get-stuff-done world, it&#8217;s hard to avoid our efficiency instinct. The answer, then, is to focus on enjoyable stuff, along with the must-dos. &#8220;Don&#8217;t fit joyful activities into your days&mdash;fit your days around them,&#8221; Biswas-Diener urges. &#8220;Do you ever hear devoted church attendees say, &#8216;Can we reschedule church because something came up?&#8217; You need to have that church mentality about whatever it is that gives you pleasure. If you say that your weeks are full, find the next blank spot in your calendar.&#8221; Protect that sacred time from &#8220;nibblers&#8221; (otherwise known as your family), adds productivity consultant Julie Morgenstern, author of <em>Time Management from the Inside Out:<\/em>&#8220;Announce to everyone that it&#8217;s your time to recharge your batteries.&#8221; Tap a friend to make sure you use that time strictly for fun.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Smell the shower gel<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The act of savoring&mdash;mining pleasant moments for their joy&mdash;is a proven happiness booster. In one study published in <em>The Journal of Positive Psychology,<\/em> 101 men and women kept diaries for a month, recording positive activities they participated in and how much they did or didn&#8217;t savor them. Those who tended to enjoy a good thing&mdash;and share their delight with others&mdash;maintained high levels of happiness no matter what the day brought, whereas nonappreciators needed positive events to get into a good mood. Savoring is a no-brainer&mdash;just tune in to your senses. Inhale that pinot grigio, feel the soft rug under your bare feet. &#8220;I leave a little time in the morning to savor my showers,&#8221; Lyubomirsky says. &#8220;I go out of my way to buy gels with the best scents.&#8221; You can even find ways to relish tasks; try running YouTube as you delete junk email. (Why hasn&#8217;t anyone yet studied the happiness powers of panda videos?!)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Ration your time<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Gold, natural gas and your attention: They&#8217;re all scarce resources. Allocate wisely so you can max out time for pleasure, recommends Paul Dolan, PhD, in his new book <em>Happiness By Design.<\/em> &#8220;Every tweet, text or email distracts us from the good experiences and people in our lives,&#8221; he says. Some research shows that heavy social media users are less merry than others. One study published in the scientific journal <em>Plos One<\/em> found that the more people went on Facebook, the more their life satisfaction levels declined. (Click: <em>dis<\/em>-like.)<\/p>\n<p><strong><strong>HEALTH.COM<\/strong>: <\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.health.com\/health\/gallery\/0,,20707868,00.html?xid=Time-happiness-092614\"><strong>12 Reasons to Stop Multitasking Now<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Experts widely recommend electronic time-outs; shut off your phone for a couple of hours a night or do email-free Saturdays or Sundays. You also want to dump any activity that &#8220;should&#8221; make you happy but in reality doesn&#8217;t, like the book club that picks crappy reads or an overly earnest yoga class. It&#8217;s hard to walk away, Dolan acknowledges, &#8220;but you probably haven&#8217;t regretted breaking joyless commitments in the past. Remember: Lost happiness is lost forever.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Think perky thoughts<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>On those days when you barely have time to breathe, recall something that made you happy and you can get a boost. In one study from Michigan State University, bus drivers who smiled as a result of thinking about a positive event, such as a child&#8217;s recital, were in more upbeat moods than workers who fake-smiled. Science suggests that a full, genuine grin&mdash;one that involves facial muscles around the eyes&mdash;sparks a change in brain activity related to a good mood. So, yep: Say cheese.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Buy some happy<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As any woman who has ever bought a trendy, overpriced accessory knows, the kick we get out of purchases wears off fast. However, spending on experiences (like tickets to a Broadway show) rather than things (another black sweater) creates lasting contentment&mdash;with one new caveat. A study co-authored by Ryan T. Howell, PhD, associate professor at San Francisco State University and director of its Personality and Well-Being Lab, found that people fail to get pleasure from objects or experiences if they&#8217;re acquiring them mainly for bragging rights. That is, if you&#8217;re more of a local-Thai-restaurant person and you plan a 40th-birthday blowout at Le Fancy Schmancy Bistro, you may get admiration on Facebook but miss out on feeling personal delight.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Play around in love<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If the words <em>Honey, take out the trash!<\/em> are your idea of foreplay, you know that running our domestic lives sometimes saps the fun out of relationships. &#8220;Playfulness energizes both of you and gets your brains in sync,&#8221; says Vagdevi Meunier, PsyD, a relationship therapist certified by the Gottman Institute in Seattle and founder of The Center for Relationships in Austin, Texas. &#8220;It also lightens the vibe of a relationship and helps us manage the business of our lives&mdash;otherwise it&#8217;s too much about dishes and bills.&#8221; She likes to tell couples she works with, &#8220;I can help you fight better, but that&#8217;s not nearly as effective as if I help you <em>play<\/em> better.&#8221; One recent suggestion to busy parents of three: Zap each other more playful texts. &#8220;They&#8217;d send links to funny sites. Or he would text her at work, suggesting she imagine him naked,&#8221; Meunier says. &#8220;The couple started looking forward to coming home instead of being grumpy. And they&#8217;d talk about the texts.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong><strong>HEALTH.COM<\/strong>: <\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.health.com\/health\/gallery\/0,,20853691,00.html?xid=Time-happiness-092614\"><strong>10 Ways to Improve Your Relationship Instantly<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Have a bad-day backup plan<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You have backup in case your electricity goes out, even if it&#8217;s just a stockpile of flashlights. Time to come up with one in case your <em>mood<\/em> fails. Michele Phillips, a performance coach in Piermont, N.Y., and author of <em>Happiness Is a Habit,<\/em> has a group of friends who&#8217;ve dubbed themselves the Village. &#8220;I can call them anytime my day is going badly, and they will change my frame of mind,&#8221; she says. She recalls sitting in a bar in Colorado after her divorce, feeling lonely and, she says, &#8220;like I had loser written on my forehead.&#8221; She called a Village friend, &#8220;and she said, &#8216;Look around: You&#8217;re in Vail, skiing!&#8217; She helped me shift the thinking from &#8216;poor me&#8217; to &#8216;lucky me.'&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Find purpose in pleasure<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For total happiness, you need a mix of activities that give you joy and a sense of meaning, what Dolan calls the pleasure-purpose principle. &#8220;If happiness were only about pleasure, what would be the point of having kids or helping others?&#8221; he says. &#8220;To be truly happy, we need feelings of purpose, too.&#8221; Think volunteer work or taking a cooking class. The positive feelings that come from these sorts of activities can help train the brain&#8217;s neurons to overcome its negativity bias. As neuropsychologist Rick Hanson, PhD, explains in his book <em>Hardwiring Happiness,<\/em> the brain is all too good at remembering adverse experiences, which he traces to ancestors who had to focus on threats like predators in order to survive. But when you rack up feel-good experiences that give you a sense of achievement, they can serve as a buffer against the disappointing ones.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Think less &#8220;me&#8221; time, more &#8220;we&#8221; time<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Truly sunny people have one thing in common, and it&#8217;s got nothing to do with their paychecks, IQs or gender, Biswas-Diener says: They have plenty of good social relationships. These include interactions that psychologists refer to as social snacking&mdash;little ways of connecting with other human beings, including strangers. In one 2014 study by Nicholas Epley, PhD, professor of behavioral science at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business and author of <em>Mindwise: How We Understand What Others Think, Believe, Feel and Want,<\/em> participants heading to work by train either refrained from engaging with fellow passengers or made conversation. Chatty commuters&mdash;both introverts and extroverts alike&mdash;reported having the most pleasant commute. In another recent study co-authored by Elizabeth Dunn, PhD, at the University of British Columbia, people kept a running tab of social interactions with folks with whom they had either a strong or weak tie. Regardless of the type of person they connected with, they consistently felt more chipper on days when they mingled.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, camaraderie is comforting&mdash;that feeling that we&#8217;re all in this crazy world together. &#8220;But when you talk with strangers, there&#8217;s also the pleasant surprise of finding stuff in common and sometimes the exhilaration of their opening up your world when they tell you something interesting you didn&#8217;t know,&#8221; Epley says. Surprisingly, having conversations with new people can even keep things upbeat at home. As Dunn puts it, &#8220;Trying to be pleasant and cheerful ends up improving your mood in ways you can&#8217;t foresee.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Go off the grid<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Weekend getaways continue to trend; cruise lines are even creating shorter jaunts for time-crunched travelers. And yet for deeper joy, you can&#8217;t beat a long trip. &#8220;One of the biggest deterrents to happiness is that we adapt to our situations&mdash;you buy your house and it has a beautiful view, but at some point you stop deriving pleasure from it,&#8221; Howell says. When you take only a quick journey, the elation spike is brief. How high you go! How quickly you return to reality! An extended vacation&mdash;even to somewhere familiar like a beach town three hours away from home&mdash;may create more impactful, lasting memories. And having a bank of them to tap into can add to happiness, research shows. So try to budget for a two-week trip. Even just planning gives you a boost: One study from the Netherlands indicated that the bliss of a trip can start months before it begins, owing to the anticipation.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Be nicer<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Nobody is calling you evil, but committing to a few do-good gestures a day can increase your general level of contentment. &#8220;I&#8217;ve found that when people are told to try to do three to five acts of kindness a week, they get happier,&#8221; Lyubomirsky reports. &#8220;It does not have to be a grand gesture, given that women are already doing so much caregiving. At the store, let someone get in line ahead of you. Give a compliment. Smile at someone.&#8221; Or simply do something thoughtful for your significant other, she continues: &#8220;We just finished a study in which we asked someone to choose a person in her life to make happier, like her husband, three times a week. It also made the <em>giver <\/em>significantly happier.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Make Sunday future-fun day<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>One enjoyable thing you should do every weekend: Make plans for the next one. &#8220;The anticipation powers you through the workweek,&#8221; Morgenstern says. The tactic also helps you avoid making passive, meh plans, like accepting the Saturday dinner invite from that couple you don&#8217;t totally like just because you have nothing better on tap. Morgenstern has a formula for a blissful weekend: PEP (physical, escape, people). In other words, a mix of physical activities that energize you, escapist activities that relax you and people who inspire you. &#8220;It&#8217;s a good framework for putting together weekends that leave you happy,&#8221; she says. Not to mention entire happier weeks.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.health.com\/health\/article\/0,,20851975,00.html\">This article originally appeared on Health.com.<\/a><\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3433493\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"Health","slug":"health","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/health\/","description":"The latest health news, trends, and commentary from TIME, covering medicine, mental health, diet, fitness, sex, aging, disease, healthcare, policy and more"},"hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/happy-woman-sunshine.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/happy-woman-sunshine.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/happy-woman-sunshine.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/happy-woman-sunshine.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/happy-woman-sunshine.jpg?w=1100"},"credit":"Getty Images","caption":"","alt":"happy woman sunshine"},"id":3433493,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3433493%2F14-ways-to-be-a-happier-person%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fp5HMd-epcV","encoded_title":"14+Ways+to+Be+a+Happier+Person","twitter_text":"14%20ways%20to%20be%20a%20happier%20person","twitter_via":"TIMEHealth","ads":{"neg":"false","post_title":"14 Ways to Be a Happier Person"},"Partner_Module":{"partner":"Health.com","post_title":"14 Ways to Be a Happier Person"},"email_title":"14%20Ways%20to%20Be%20a%20Happier%20Person%20%7C%20TIME","email_body":"14%20Ways%20to%20Be%20a%20Happier%20Person%0A%0ABillboard-worthy%20news%3A%20It%27s%20possible%20to%20amp%20up%20your%20bliss%20every%20single%20day%20with%20these%20simple%2C%20unexpected%20strategies%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3433493%2F14-ways-to-be-a-happier-person%2F","omniture":{"modules":"rr-taboola-video|rr-partner|rr-mag|rr-ad"}},{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/3433652\/laguna-beach-10-year-anniversary\/","shortlink":"http:\/\/wp.me\/p5HMd-epfu","title":"<i>Laguna Beach<\/i>, 10 Years Later: All This Drama Started With the Black and White Party","post_type":"post","time_article":true,"comments_allowed":true,"short_title":"<i>Laguna Beach<\/i>, 10 Years Later: All This Drama Started With the Black and White Party","excerpt":"Revisiting the iconic MTV show, ten years later","format":"article","time":{"pretty":"7:00 AM ET","published":"2014-09-28 07:00:45","updated":"2014-09-28 11:00:45","minute":"7:00 am","short":"7:00 AM ET"},"authors":[{"id":207071759,"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/author\/time-staff\/","name":"Rachel McRady","bio":"","short_bio":"","types":[],"twitter":"","twitter_url":"","gplus":"","fb":"","email":"","thumbnail":null,"contributor":true}],"content":"<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-taboola-video\" data-name=\"rr-taboola-video\"><div id=\"taboola-right-rail-organic-video-3433652\" class=\"taboola\" data-mode=\"verticalx3\" data-placement=\"right-rail-organic\" data-type=\"video\"><\/div><\/aside><p>Let&rsquo;s go back &mdash; back to the beginning. Ten years ago today, on Sept. 28, 2004, the world was introduced to Lauren Conrad, Stephen Colletti, Kristin Cavallari, and their high school friends in a small California town called Laguna Beach. Nestled in Orange County, the town&#8217;s picturesque look and massive homes inspired MTV&rsquo;s initial pitch of a real-life version of <em>The O.C.<\/em> &mdash; an insider&rsquo;s look into the lives of the young, rich, and beautiful.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-partner\" data-name=\"rr-partner\"><div class=\"read-more-list\"><h6 class=\"read-more-list-h\">More<\/h6><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3438643\/chris-pratt-hosts-snl-best-worst-and-weirdest-moments\/\" class=\"read-more-list-article\" data-event=\"rr-more\">Chris Pratt Hosts <i>SNL<\/i>: Best, Worst, and Weirdest Moments<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3430460\/rolling-stone-gross-out-tv\/\" class=\"read-more-list-article\" data-event=\"rr-more\">No Guts, No Glory: The Rise of Gross-Out TV<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/news\/world\/mount-ontake-erupts-japanese-volcano-rescuers-find-31-hikers-presumed-n213341?cid=par-time_20140928\" class=\"read-more-partner-article\" data-event=\"rr-partner\" target=\"_blank\">No Pulse: Volcano Rescuers Find 31 Hikers Presumed Dead <span>NBC News<\/span><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/storyline\/isis-terror\/airstrikes-hit-isis-controlled-oil-refinery-syria-n213421?cid=par-time_20140928\" class=\"read-more-partner-article\" data-event=\"rr-partner\" target=\"_blank\">Continued Onslaught: Airstrikes Hit ISIS Oil Refinery <span>NBC News<\/span><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/storyline\/michael-brown-shooting\/ferguson-missouri-police-officer-shot-saturday-evening-n213326?cid=par-time_20140928\" class=\"read-more-partner-article\" data-event=\"rr-partner\" target=\"_blank\">Ferguson Police Officer Is Shot, Suspect at Large <span>NBC News<\/span><\/a><\/div><\/aside><p>But the show morphed into a never-before-attempted experiment in reality television that simply followed its subjects&rsquo; lives, rather than manipulating them into uncomfortable situations.

The formula clearly worked, with hordes of fans still tuning into RetroMTV&rsquo;s summer marathons years later, but it was never replicated after LC and her friends left the small town for bigger lives. Three successful seasons later, <em>Laguna<\/em> went off the air and the network attempted to capitalize on the series&rsquo; success, creating shows like<em> Newport Harbor<\/em> and <em>8th &amp; Ocean<\/em> to emulate the same &ldquo;real lives of the rich&rdquo; vibe. Neither show took off with the same gusto or found a love triangle as supported as the one between Conrad, Colletti, and Cavallari.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, reality TV evolved into a study in the ridiculous and the over-the-top. Series were secretly scripted by producers. Cast members learned that the more drama they created, the more air time they&rsquo;d get.<\/p>\n<p>In 2006, several months before the third season of <em>Laguna Beach<\/em> ended, Bravo premiered <em>The Real Housewives of Orange County<\/em>, the first installment in would become Andy Cohen&rsquo;s empire of collagen-injected Housewives, looking for a fight. They showed off their mansions, went on shopping sprees, and ripped out each other&rsquo;s extensions &mdash; all for the chance at C-List stardom. Three years later, MTV&rsquo;s <em>Jersey Shore<\/em> premiered at the opposite end of the spectrum, as a more down-and-dirty <em>Real World<\/em> with Snooki, The Situation, and JWoww hitting the gym, baking their bodies in the tanning salon, and hooking up in the clubs. The days of innocent Cabo bar-top dancing were over.<\/p>\n<p>So what happened to that scrappy group of teens from the small coastal town? They dominated the airwaves before social media was even a factor, and while some went on to fashion lines, hit TV shows, best-selling novels, and rose-colored Instagram filters, most of the cast now leads relatively normal lives.<\/p>\n<p>Stephen Colletti took his pretty face and acting chops to Hollywood, where he starred as Chase Adams on the CW&rsquo;s <em>One Tree Hill<\/em> from 2007 to 2012. Kristin Cavallari left behind her high school sweetheart, and appeared on the last two seasons of <em>The Hills<\/em> before hitting the <em>Dancing With the Stars<\/em> circuit, becoming a mom (twice!), marrying Chicago Bears quarterback Jay Cutler, and starting her own Chinese Laundry shoe line. And Lauren Conrad proved to be the most successful of all, narrating and starring in five seasons of<em> The Hills<\/em>, penning eight books (one of which was a New York Times bestseller), running her clothing line Paper Crown, creating a line for Kohl&#8217;s, consistently working with philanthropic groups like BlueAvocado and The Little Market, and &mdash; most recently &mdash; getting married to William Tell.<\/p>\n<p>But what about their high school friends who didn&rsquo;t go on to fame and fortune? Christina Sinclair (formerly Schuller), Morgan Smith (formerly Olsen), Jen Bunney, and Dieter Schmitz opened up about their experience on the show, how it shaped their lives, and their thoughts on their childhood friends&rsquo; fame.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TIME: What made you want to be involved with the show?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Christina Sinclair:<\/strong> We&rsquo;re sitting there in class, and over the daily announcements they announce, &lsquo;Okay everyone, MTV&rsquo;s here. They&rsquo;re going to cast a reality show on Laguna Beach. If you&rsquo;re interested, sign up in the quad at break.&rsquo; And I think for any 18 year old, that&rsquo;s a dream come true. It&rsquo;s like <em>Grease &mdash;<\/em> when they say they&rsquo;re going to film their prom and it&rsquo;s going to be on national television. Oh my gosh, I have to do it! Just the prospect of having that opportunity, especially as a teenager, you think, &#8216;Oh, this fame, this great chance to show who I am to the world.&#8217;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Morgan Smith:<\/strong> I thought it would be a fun experience to do with friends, and also a way to capture my high school experience on film. Something to show the kids one day!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Jen Bunney:<\/strong> We&rsquo;d fill out these questionnaires, and basically they picked my friends. They didn&rsquo;t pick me, they picked my friends, and just by association I became involved with the show. At that point, I was kind of shy and not really into boys yet. I was late with all that. I didn&rsquo;t have my first kiss until I was 16. I was sort of removed. I was just starting to get into the whole popular, boy, boyfriend, party, drinking scene. So I was more on a periphery at that point, which is good. It allowed me to concentrate on school and things that were actually important to my future.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Dieter Schmitz:<\/strong> They cast actual friends. Why wouldn&rsquo;t you want to do an MTV show with your best friends? Most of the cast were people I&rsquo;d known my whole life. I still see some of them everytime I go home. It seemed like a no-brainer.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Did you have dreams of stardom, or think about becoming famous when you signed on?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>CS:<\/strong> I was involved in musical theater. I was the lead in the musical at that time. The timing was such that I really felt that <em>that<\/em> was what I was supposed to do with my life. I had just gotten cast as the lead in the musical. I was loving it. I really felt that God wanted me to kind of pursue that more in-depth, so I definitely had those aspirations before the show, and being cast really reaffirmed that for me.<\/p>\n<p><strong>MS:<\/strong> Acting and being a celebrity was never really the path I wanted.<\/p>\n<p><strong>JB:<\/strong> It was a popularity thing. It was fun. It was the cool thing to talk about. It wasn&rsquo;t like it is now. If you&rsquo;re in high school, and you have your own show, you&rsquo;re just awesome. But kids didn&rsquo;t view it that way necessarily, when they came to Laguna Beach. They didn&rsquo;t really understand the capability of the impact that national television could have when your life is featured on it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was filming like while still being a high school student?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>CS:<\/strong> They wanted to do it like <em>Real World<\/em>. I remember our initial contract was like, &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll film you all the time. We can have cameras in your bedroom.&rsquo; And all of us were like, &lsquo;Absolutely not. That&rsquo;s not happening.&rsquo; So I think it kind of forced them to take a step back and do it in a different way.<\/p>\n<p><strong>MS:<\/strong> It wasn&rsquo;t a 24\/7 filming experience like other reality shows. We had set times after school to meet during the week. I would say we filmed anywhere from two to three times per week from 3-7 p.m. or something along those lines.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What were the most deceptive elements of the show?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>JB:<\/strong> I honestly think <em>Laguna Beach<\/em> was pretty good. For the characters that they focused on, I&rsquo;d say it was pretty right on. They did some scripting in the sense that they would set up scenes. But it was based on real-life things that were going on. They didn&rsquo;t concoct anything like they did on <em>The Hills<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>MS:<\/strong> I would say the slogan &ldquo;They really are this rich and beautiful.&rdquo; Seriously? They couldn&rsquo;t have picked a better slogan? I drove a Jetta that they liked to refer to as a &ldquo;German sports car&rdquo; &ndash; not quite!<\/p>\n<p><strong>CS:<\/strong> I think for the most part, it was accurate. I do think that they made it out to be almost an &ldquo;us versus them&rdquo; thing in some episodes, and it wasn&rsquo;t really like that. I mean, we were all friends, and it was high school. All friendships have their ups and downs, but I look back at high school and that group of people, and we were all friends.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you think your portrayal was accurate?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>CS:<\/strong> It&rsquo;s one of those things where if you don&rsquo;t say something, or you don&rsquo;t do something, they can&rsquo;t make you do it. They can&rsquo;t put words in your mouth. It is what it is. All those looks, any words that were said &mdash; they were said.<\/p>\n<p><strong>MS:<\/strong> A 30-minute segment can never show all of who you are. It&rsquo;s interesting because when people came up to me after the show and felt like they knew me, I always thought that was funny. They really only knew a 30 minute, cut-down version of me. Still, it was great to know people felt connected.<\/p>\n<p><strong>JB:<\/strong> There were a million things that embarrassed me, but overall, I was just super goofy and funny. When I said things, I didn&rsquo;t really think of them in the sense that they&rsquo;re going on national television. I thought of things as, &ldquo;This is going to make my friend laugh.&rdquo; So that&rsquo;s how I looked at it. I feel that my portrayal on <em>Laguna Beach<\/em> was a lot more accurate than it was on <em>The Hills<\/em> even though they made me sound like an airhead on<em> Laguna Beach<\/em>. But at the same time, I wasn&rsquo;t the focus. I was not a main character. So anytime I would support a main character, or say something about a main character, or talk to a main character, they would air those lines. So that would be how people looked at me, even though that had nothing to do with my life.<\/p>\n<p><strong>DS:<\/strong> Nothing aired that I didn&rsquo;t say or do, and I never felt like the show was trying to manipulate me or my friends. It was all pretty genuine.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Did you know the show would be a hit from the beginning?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>DS:<\/strong> I had no idea it would be as popular as it was. We didn&rsquo;t think much about becoming famous. We were just enjoying high school with our friends.<\/p>\n<p><strong>JB:<\/strong> I think it&rsquo;s before reality TV really picked up, and so it gave us a chance to be ourselves without really recognizing the impact it was going to make on pop culture and on the country. We had no idea that saying something stupid or mean was going to really be reverberated throughout the entire country. I think once <em>The Hills<\/em> started, people were like, &ldquo;Oh, this is serious, this is going to be airing on national television.&rdquo; When we started filming [Laguna], they didn&rsquo;t know that it was going to get picked up. We were just filming a pilot for fun. We weren&rsquo;t thinking of national television in the sense that this is going to be on every TV set. So it really gave us a chance to be really genuine and vulnerable, which I think is pretty rare nowadays.<\/p>\n<p><strong>CS:<\/strong> I think for all of us, we didn&rsquo;t know what it was going to be. We thought it was going to be a <em>Made<\/em> or a <em>True Life<\/em>. There was nothing really like that on the air at the time, so we had no idea what to expect. The attention that we got from it, it was crazy. We thought it was maybe going to be a half-hour special that was going to air a few times. We never realized that it was going to turn into a series that was going to gain so much momentum.<\/p>\n<p><strong>MS:<\/strong> I thought it was going to be a <em>True Life<\/em> or some sort of documentary. I remember seeing my first billboard, and then my first ad in <em>Us Weekly<\/em>. It was all so surreal at the time.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How would social media shape the show today?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>CS:<\/strong> I think it goes both ways. It&rsquo;s crazy, now you watch reality television, and they&rsquo;re all over the place, all over the tabloids, all over everything. But we were the first real reality show that wasn&rsquo;t any sort of a structure, like <em>Real World<\/em>. There [were no] on-camera interviews. In some ways, [it was] a blessing that we didn&rsquo;t have to deal with all the social media and all the negative stuff that comes with that. But at the same token, you look at Bethenny Frankel and the empire she&rsquo;s created &mdash; separate from her television personality, her Skinnygirl cocktails and all the stuff. If you&rsquo;re launching a business, it&rsquo;s such a great opportunity &mdash; great exposure, free PR. There&rsquo;s definitely pros and cons to it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>MS:<\/strong> I think it was a blessing that we didn&rsquo;t have social media, I see those candidates on <em>The Bachelor<\/em> getting slaughtered on Twitter and my heart really does go out to them. They are people that feel, and although some may think they ask for it &mdash; it still hurts.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you think of Lauren Conrad, Stephen Colletti, and Kristin Cavallari&rsquo;s fame?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>DS:<\/strong> Lauren&rsquo;s one of my best friends. She hasn&rsquo;t changed at all since we were kids. She&rsquo;s still the same, kind person I knew growing up. We still see each other occasionally, and she hasn&rsquo;t changed a bit.<\/p>\n<p><strong>JB:<\/strong> It was cool. I&rsquo;ve always really liked Kristin, and I&rsquo;ve always really liked Lauren, so it wasn&rsquo;t like seeing people I hate rise to fame. It was seeing people I know and love rise to fame.<\/p>\n<p><strong>CS:<\/strong> I&rsquo;m so happy for them. They&rsquo;ve made the most of what we were given and I&rsquo;m so proud of them. Every opportunity that Lauren&rsquo;s created for herself, from <em>Laguna Beach<\/em> to <em>The Hills<\/em> to her clothing line to everything that she&rsquo;s done. It&rsquo;s phenomenal. She&rsquo;s created such an empire for herself and it&rsquo;s awesome to see a girl that you grew up with have that success.<\/p>\n<p><strong>In the battle for Stephen&rsquo;s heart, were you Team LC or Team Kristin?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>DS:<\/strong> I was probably Team Lauren. I got why Stephen liked Kristin. She was really cool, but Lauren and I had been best friends for a long time, so I always wanted them to get together.<\/p>\n<p><strong>JB:<\/strong> I was probably on Team LC. My loyalty resided with her, even though I really liked Kristin. I&rsquo;d known Lauren since I was really young. I sort of supported her, but at the same time, it was all up to Stephen, so it was hard to be on someone&rsquo;s side. It <em>did<\/em> seem like a big deal at the time. Lauren and Stephen had had a really long history, and then Kristin and Stephen had a really intense but shorter history, so it was two different types of relationships.<\/p>\n<p><strong>CS:<\/strong> I think I was Team Stephen. I grew up taking baths with Stephen. His mom is my godmother. He&rsquo;s like a cousin to me. So I always wanted him to be happy. In high school I feel like it was changing so frequently that I didn&rsquo;t care, but I did care about the girls&rsquo; feelings. I just feel like, &ldquo;Come on Stephen, don&rsquo;t be messing around. If you like Kristin, like Kristin. If you like Lauren, like Lauren. Don&rsquo;t be a little player!&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did being on the show affect your future?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>CS:<\/strong> I was going to go to SMU in Dallas. Then, right before I left, I felt that getting cast on Laguna was so reaffirming that I needed to really pursue acting, and I didn&rsquo;t end up going to SMU. I&rsquo;m so glad I didn&rsquo;t, because I probably wouldn&rsquo;t have met my husband, nor any of the other friends I met going to USC. There&rsquo;s always the possibility that maybe I would have gone to SMU, and who knows where I&rsquo;d be today. But other than that, I think essentially, who I am as a person would not be different.<\/p>\n<p><strong>DS:<\/strong> The network would put us up in these amazing hotels [for the press tour], and I remember not always receiving the best treatment because people saw us as stupid teenagers. It actually inspired me to get into hospitality, because I saw such a difference in how some places treated us versus others.<\/p>\n<p><strong>MS:<\/strong> I&#8217;m not sure, to be honest. I did the things I think I would have wanted regardless of being on a TV show &mdash; graduate college, travel, get married, and start my career in New York and now Los Angeles &mdash; I would say it helped with confidence and meeting people.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you regret doing the show?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>JB:<\/strong> Overall, no. Now that it&rsquo;s been so far removed from my actual life, it&rsquo;s fun to look back on it and have this experience you can share with your children someday, and have it be this cool thing you did. I don&rsquo;t think anyone from <em>Laguna Beach<\/em> had anything to be bitter about.<\/p>\n<p><strong>CS:<\/strong> I definitely would do it again.

So it makes sense that we&rsquo;re eager to attribute their canine behavior to human emotions, crediting a wagging tail to joy or lowered eyes to shame. Yet while research has shown dogs <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/10\/06\/opinion\/sunday\/dogs-are-people-too.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\">feel love and affection<\/a>, more complicated emotions like <a href=\"http:\/\/moderndogmagazine.com\/articles\/which-emotions-do-dogs-actually-experience\/32883\">embarrassment and guilt<\/a>don&rsquo;t seem to be in their repertoire.<\/p>\n<p>(<a href=\"http:\/\/www.realsimple.com\/health\/mind-mood\/emotional-health\/happiness-studies-00100000129314\/index.html?xid=time-rs-081814\" target=\"_blank\">MORE: 8 Scientifically-Backed Ways to Feel Happier Right Now<\/a>)<\/p>\n<p>But here&rsquo;s one that might be: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0094597\">Scientists at UC San Diego<\/a> have found evidence suggesting that dogs could actually be capable of jealousy.<\/p>\n<p>Although Charles Darwin wrote about dogs&rsquo; jealousy in 1871 and dog owners have been quick to offer anecdotal evidence ever since, there&rsquo;s never been scientific proof of the phenomenon.<\/p>\n<p>This experiment involved 36 dogs and their owners. The owners petted an animated toy dog while their real dog was in the room. They also petted and played with a jack-o-lantern, and sat reading a noise-making children&rsquo;s book. Observers wrote down and cataloged the dogs&rsquo; reactions to each of these three situations, which ranged from biting, barking, and pushing at either the toy or the owner.<\/p>\n<p>(<a href=\"http:\/\/www.realsimple.com\/work-life\/entertainment\/classic-childrens-books-00100000129234\/index.html?xid=time-rs-081814\" target=\"_blank\">MORE: 40 Classic Children&#8217;s Books<\/a>)<\/p>\n<p>The dogs were more likely to show signs of aggression, attention-seeking behavior, and a heightened interest in their owners when the fake dog was the object of affection. Most of the dogs clearly thought the stuffed dog was real: 86 percent inspected and sniffed its butt at some point during the experiment.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t really speak to the dogs&#8217; subjective experiences, of course,&rdquo; study author and psychology professor Christine Harris <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sciencedaily.com\/releases\/2014\/07\/140723141716.htm\">said in a release<\/a>. &ldquo;But it looks as though they were motivated to protect an important social relationship.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>So is this behavior really the green-eyed monster as we know it? Not quite. Researchers called the envious emotion that dogs experience a &ldquo;primordial&rdquo; type of jealousy rather than the complicated thoughts that torment adult humans.<\/p>\n<p>Infants show this instinctive kind of jealousy, too, when their mothers shower affection on another baby. The scientists behind the study say this could be evidence that jealousy is an innate emotion, like fear or anger, that humans share in common with other social creatures.<\/p>\n<p>So if it seems like Fido is giving you the cold paw after you&rsquo;ve shown some love to another dog, it might not be your imagination.<\/p>\n<p>(<a href=\"http:\/\/www.realsimple.com\/work-life\/life-strategies\/marjorie-ingall-apologies-00100000128733\/\/index.html?xid=time-rs-081814\" target=\"_blank\">MORE: How Not to Apologize<\/a>)<\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-pos=\"11\"><object id=\"bc-video-3773602648001-11\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#000000\"><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"1847503743001\"><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/wp.me\/p5HMd-ehpK\"><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"TIME_onTemplateLoad\"><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"TIME_onTemplateReady\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"><param name=\"htmlFallback\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"3773602648001\"><\/object><\/div>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3403536\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"Living","slug":"living","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/living\/","description":"The latest news and commentary from TIME on society, relationships, parenting, sex, psychology, aging, gender, career, women's issues, marriage, love and more"},"tag":{"name":"Pets","slug":"pets","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tag\/pets\/"},"tags":"animals|Pets|psychology","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/460379723.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/460379723.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/460379723.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/460379723.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/460379723.jpg?w=1100"},"credit":"Simone Ciaralli\u2014Getty Images\/Flickr RF","caption":"Dog Zwergpinscher","alt":"460379723"},"id":3403536,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3403536%2Fyes-dogs-can-get-jealous-too%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fp5HMd-ehpK","encoded_title":"Yes%2C+Dogs+Can+Get+Jealous+Too","twitter_text":"Yes%2C%20dogs%20can%20get%20jealous%20too","twitter_via":"TIME","ads":{"neg":"false","post_title":"Yes, Dogs Can Get Jealous Too"},"Partner_Module":{"partner":"Real Simple","post_title":"Yes, Dogs Can Get Jealous Too"},"email_title":"Yes%2C%20Dogs%20Can%20Get%20Jealous%20Too%20%7C%20TIME","email_body":"Yes%2C%20Dogs%20Can%20Get%20Jealous%20Too%0A%0AA%20new%20study%20offers%20scientific%20backing%20to%20a%20long-reported%20anecdotal%20phenomenon.%20But%20canine%20envy%20is%20a%20little%20different%20from%20the%20human%20kind.%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3403536%2Fyes-dogs-can-get-jealous-too%2F","omniture":{"modules":"rr-taboola-video|rr-ad"}},{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/3438054\/colorados-gubernatorial-race-could-determine-the-u-s-senate-race\/","shortlink":"http:\/\/wp.me\/p5HMd-eqou","title":"Colorado\u2019s Gubernatorial Race Could Determine the U.S. Senate Race","post_type":"post","time_article":true,"comments_allowed":true,"short_title":"Colorado\u2019s Gubernatorial Race Could Determine the U.S. Senate Race","excerpt":"And 7 other states to watch","format":"article","time":{"pretty":"Sept. 27, 2014","published":"2014-09-27 20:09:41","updated":"2014-09-28 00:09:41","minute":"8:09 pm","short":"9\/27"},"authors":[{"id":213517826,"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/author\/sarah-begley\/","name":"Sarah Begley","bio":"Sarah Begley is Digital Operations Editor for TIME.com.","short_bio":"","types":[],"twitter":"SCBegley","twitter_url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/SCBegley","gplus":"117345536491513403348","fb":"","email":"","thumbnail":"http:\/\/i2.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/03\/mg_3363.jpg?crop=248px%2C118px%2C2684px%2C2684px&resize=100%2C100","contributor":false}],"content":"<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-taboola-video\" data-name=\"rr-taboola-video\"><div id=\"taboola-right-rail-organic-video-3438054\" class=\"taboola\" data-mode=\"verticalx3\" data-placement=\"right-rail-organic\" data-type=\"video\"><\/div><\/aside><p>November&rsquo;s election will be close for a handful of Senators and Senate hopefuls.

As Barnes explains, Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper was very popular when he was elected four years ago&mdash;but that was when the Democrats had marijuana on the ballot.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not there now,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;and the Governor passed what I think is a very reasonable gun control bill that has hurt him with the gun people,&rdquo; whose support he had last time around. With Coloradans divided on their Democratic governor&rsquo;s report card, Barnes fears, their Democratic Senator&rsquo;s star may fall. This state, Barnes says, &ldquo;is the only place where I think a governors&rsquo; race could have an effect on the Senate race.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s the only exciting Senate race to watch. Far from it: Barnes counts seven other states where tight polls make the election too close to call, for now.<\/p>\n<p>Take Louisiana, where Mary Landrieu (D) will defend her seat against Rep. Bill Cassidy, who has pulled ahead in the polls. But Barnes asks, &ldquo;Will Louisiana give up the chairmanship of the energy committee&mdash;when hydrocarbons are so important to Louisiana&mdash;for a doctor who will have no seniority and will not have good committees even if the Republicans control the Senate?&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>In Alaska, he says, it&rsquo;s impossible to predict the tight race between Sen. Mark Begich (D) and Dan Sullivan&mdash;a race in which the NRA recently <a href=\"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/2014\/09\/24\/nra-alaska-senate_n_5878300.html\">declined<\/a> to endorse either candidate. &ldquo;The national pollsters are having trouble even running polls in Alaska,&rdquo; Barnes says, because cell phone-based polling doesn&rsquo;t <a href=\"http:\/\/election.princeton.edu\/2014\/09\/25\/alaska-voters-powerful-but-mysterious\/\">work<\/a> there.<\/p>\n<p>In Kansas, Barnes says, it looked like a fairly clear victory for Republican incumbent Pat Roberts&mdash;until the Democrat in the race, Chad Taylor, pulled out and endorsed the Independent candidate, Greg Orman. Orman is now <a href=\"http:\/\/www.realclearpolitics.com\/epolls\/2014\/senate\/ks\/kansas_senate_roberts_vs_orman-5216.html\">ahead<\/a> in the polls.<\/p>\n<p>Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is one of the biggest names in American politics, but even this will not protect him from a testy race. His opponent Alison Lundergan Grimes has given him a run for his money at the polls, and garnered plenty of media attention. &ldquo;That could be an upset,&rdquo; Barnes says, &ldquo;as it was when Tom Daschle, the Majority Leader of the Senate, got defeated in South Dakota, which I thought was impossible. But it&rsquo;s not impossible for a leader of the Senate to get defeated.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Close-call races will make for an interesting month in North Carolina, Iowa, Kansas and Georgia as well. &ldquo;The races are so close,&rdquo; Barnes says, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s the people, the public, the voters. I&rsquo;ve never seen them as turned off as they are today with both parties. The people are not <em>for<\/em> people, they&rsquo;re against people, and there&rsquo;s just utter disgust because we&rsquo;ve not been able to get more done in Congress.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Barnes, who has close ties to several of the Democrats on the ballot this fall, believes his party has tried to keep the issues simple and appearances by national Democrats rare. &ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t people coming in from outside the state like the President or the Vice-President or the cabinet officers&rdquo; to stump for candidates, he says.<\/p>\n<p>If nothing else, Barnes hopes this cycle sends a message to Congress that it&rsquo;s time for change and action. &ldquo;I hope that it&rsquo;s gonna make the leaders of both parties understand that they cannot go to Washington and create gridlock just for the political benefit of a party,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Democrat, but the Democrats have not been as responsible as they should have been, along with the Republicans. I&rsquo;d like to see the voters punish a Congress that was a do-nothing Congress.&rdquo;<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3438054\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/politics\/","description":"Political insight from the Beltway and beyond.

He was 73.<\/p>\n<p>Traficant was seriously injured Tuesday after a vintage tractor flipped over on him as he tried to park it inside a barn on the family farm near Youngstown. He died four days later in the hospital, said Dave Betras, chairman of the Mahoning County Democratic Party.<\/p>\n<p>The Democrat&#8217;s expulsion from Congress in 2002 came three months after a federal jury in Cleveland convicted him. Prosecutors said he used his office to extract bribes from businesspeople and coerced staffers to work on his farm and his house boat on the Potomac River in Washington. He also was charged with witness tampering, destroying evidence and filing false tax returns. He spent seven years in prison.<\/p>\n<p>Traficant&#8217;s notoriety was rivaled only by his eccentricity.<\/p>\n<p>He loved to play the buffoon during his 17 years in Congress. He got plenty of notice within the staid, buttoned-down Capitol and airtime on C-SPAN for his messy mop of hair &mdash; revealed to be a wig when he went to prison &mdash; his typical wardrobe of cowboy boots, denim or polyester suits, and his bombastic speaking style.<\/p>\n<p>His made-for-TV rants on the House floor invariably ended with the signoff &#8220;Beam me up,&#8221; which Traficant borrowed from &#8220;Star Trek&#8221; to show his disgust or bemusement at whatever he found particularly outrageous.<\/p>\n<p>He was born May 8, 1941, in Youngstown and was a quarterback for the University of Pittsburgh, where he played with future NFL coaches Mike Ditka and Marty Schottenheimer.<\/p>\n<p>He worked as a drug counselor for 10 years before running for Mahoning County sheriff at a colleague&#8217;s suggestion.<\/p>\n<p>He endeared himself to voters in the early 1980s by defying the courts and going to jail for three nights rather than foreclose on the homes of workers laid off from the city&#8217;s dying steel industry.<\/p>\n<p>The antagonism between Traficant and federal law enforcement authorities lasted throughout his public career, with Traficant trumpeting it as proof that he was on the side of &#8220;the little guy&#8221; against powerful government interests.<\/p>\n<p>He faced his first federal bribery and corruption trial in 1983, when he was Mahoning County sheriff. Prosecutors accused Traficant of taking bribes to protect mobsters&#8217; criminal activity. He defended himself in court, although he was not a lawyer, and won. He argued that he was conducting a one-person sting.<\/p>\n<p>He was elected to Congress the following year and was easily re-elected eight times.<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3437604\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/politics\/","description":"Political insight from the Beltway and beyond.
