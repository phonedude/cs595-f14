<p>Earlier this week, John Green – author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fault-Our-Stars-John-Green/dp/014242417X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1411394329&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+fault+in+our+stars" target="_blank"><em>The Fault in Our Stars</em></a> – sat down to discuss his <em>New York Times</em>’ best-selling novel and the complex and evolving story of cancer.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">While researching and writing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fault-Our-Stars-John-Green/dp/014242417X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1411394329&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+fault+in+our+stars" target="_blank"><em>The Fault in Our Stars</em></a>, Green relied heavily on the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Emperor-All-Maladies-Biography-Cancer/dp/1439170916/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1411394400&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+emperor+of+all+maladies" target="_blank"><em>The Emperor of All Maladies</em></a> – a comprehensive look at the history of cancer written by Dr. Siddhartha Mukherjee. Today, <em>The Emperor of All Maladies</em> is being made into a three-part, six-hour major television event from preeminent documentary filmmaker Ken Burns. The film, <a href="http://thestoryofcancer.org/" target="_blank"><em>The Story of Cancer: The Emperor of All Maladies</em></a> will premiere in March 2015 on PBS stations across the country.</p>
<p>The following interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Q: Tell us a little bit about your experience as a chaplain at the children’s hospital and how that influenced your work on The Fault in Our Stars? </em></strong></p>
<p>JG: Right after I graduated from college and just before I was supposed to start at the University of Chicago Divinity School (although I ended up dropping out of divinity school before I ever really became a student), I worked at a children’s hospital in Ohio. While I was there I knew a lot of young people who had cancer or other serious illnesses. I was often with young people when they died and with families after the death of a child.</p>
<p>Although it was only 6 months of my life, that was very important work for me, and I’ve turned back to it a lot over the years.  When I wrote <em>The Fault in Our Stars</em> I was thinking a lot about that time and the young people I had known there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Q: In previous interviews you have also talked about the important role that Esther Earl – a young woman who was diagnosed with metastasized papillary thyroid cancer and died of the disease at age 16 – played in inspiring The Fault in Our Stars. Did your friendship with Esther challenge the lessons you learned as a chaplain? How did she influence the way you thought about diseases like cancer? </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">JG: When I worked at the hospital, I was seeing young people in times of intense crisis, and often at the very end of their lives. I emerged from that experience very angry and pretty nihilistic. It was very difficult for me to feel hopeful based on the experiences that I had and the things I had witnessed: both the horrors of illness and, at times, the horrors of treatment.<a href="http://cancerfilmblog.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/john-green-385.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-743 alignright" src="http://cancerfilmblog.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/john-green-385-200x300.jpg" alt="john green-385" width="205" height="308" /></a></p>
<p>It wasn’t until 2009, when I became friends with Esther, that I saw a much more complicated portrait of young people living with life-threatening illness or with terminal illness.</p>
<p>I don’t want to &#8211; in any way &#8211; diminish how unfair it is that she died at the age of 16, or how difficult and painful the last couple years of her life were. But there was also meaning in that life. There was also a lot of hope in it, and there was also a lot of love. Esther was grateful to be alive. Esther was grateful for her life, her life was full of love, and she had a deep love for her family. I found a lot of hope in that, hope that I hadn’t had as a chaplain at the hospital.</p>
<p>My friendship with Esther did make me rethink a lot of things because while I was seeing maybe a slightly broader slice of Esther’s life than I was with the kids I spent time with at the hospital, I was still only seeing a slice. I came to understand that it would be unfair of me to take my ‘healthy person’s experience’ and try to directly transport that onto the experience of someone else. I guess one of the great gifts of my friendship was Esther was in learning that I had to listen. I had to listen much more and much better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Q: When it comes to fully understanding cancer, do you think that our public dialogue about the disease adequately includes the voices of those dealing with it first-hand? Or are the experiences of those who have cancer and survived cancer not reflected in our dialogue?</em></strong></p>
<p>JG: I don’t think we have enough stories that are reflective of the experiences of people living with cancer, although we have some great cancer memoirs for sure. I also think that the experience of living with cancer is always changing – not only the culture around it but the treatments for the disease.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest problem though is that we’re often trying to talk about cancer as if it’s one thing when of course it isn’t. For example, basal cell carcinoma is very different from pancreatic cancer in every way: in treatment, in diagnosis, and in the way that it changes your life. It is problematic to try and craft a single narrative – to try and say what cancer is and what cancer isn’t, when it isn’t just one thing, it isn’t just one experience.</p>
<p>What is most important to me is that people know that their experience with cancer is OK. There is nothing wrong with different ways of approaching or dealing with a diagnosis in most cases, because we aren’t just talking about one monolithic disease.</p>
<p>For example, one of the most surprising things I learned while writing <em>The Fault in Our Stars</em> was that most people who die of cancer die in the developing world. Now that the book has been published all over the world, I hear from readers who live on every continent (except Antarctica) and their experiences with cancer are vastly different based upon where they live.</p>
<p>From the culture that surrounds the disease to the treatment opportunities that are available, a cancer diagnosis can be very different experience in different parts of the world. In fact, there are lots of people living with cancer who don’t even have access to morphine. I think that’s really important to remember, because a lot of times those voices of cancer survivors in the developing world don’t have the access or the amplification of other voices.</p>

<p><strong><em>Q: In The Fault in Our Stars, you credit The Emperor of All Maladies as a major resource for your writing. How did Dr. Mukherjee’s work help you?</em></strong></p>
<p>JG: I had been trying to write about serious illness among children, and cancer especially, almost since the day I left my role as chaplain – and I just never had any success. The results had always been maudlin, and self-absorbed, and nihilistic, and all the things that fiction can’t afford to be.</p>
<p>So I had been researching the topic off and on for ten years by the time <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Emperor-All-Maladies-Biography-Cancer/dp/1439170916/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1411394052&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+emperor+of+all+maladies" target="_blank"><em>The Emperor of All Maladies</em></a> came out. My father-in-law is a cancer surgeon, and he initially turned me onto <em>The</em> <em>Emperor of All Maladies</em>. He said, ‘there is this really great book that takes a historical view of cancer, but it is also very personal and very narrative.’ I had struggled through a lot of the proper biology books that one would traditionally read to understand cancer, so it was a great joy to read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Emperor-All-Maladies-Biography-Cancer/dp/1439170916/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1411394052&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+emperor+of+all+maladies" target="_blank"><em>The Emperor of All Maladies</em></a> because it reads like a novel – and a very good one.</p>
<p>As we’ve discussed, cancer is this complicated, many-tentacled class of thousands of diseases or even millions of diseases. The scope of the condition is so vast that it can make understanding it a very cold and distant process. The wonderful thing about <em>The Emperor of All Maladies</em> is that it is never cold, it is never distant, but it is also rigorously researched and very, very intelligent. That’s incredibly hard to do well.</p>
<p>I think that the book is the biggest contribution to the field of how we think about, and talk about, cancer that I have come across. It really changed a lot of how we think about – I would say the disease, but really the series of diseases – and it helped me to understand that we’re in the middle of an extremely &#8211; extremely &#8211; complex story.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Q: Was The Emperor of All Maladies part inspiration the title of the fictional book that is featured in your novel: An Imperial Affliction? </em></strong></p>
<p>JG: No, it’s a very unlikely coincidence. I drew <em>An Imperial Affliction</em> from Emily Dickinson’s poem <a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/174992" target="_blank"><em>There’s a certain Slant of light</em></a>: “an imperial infliction sent to us from air…” The line is so evocative and says so much about our experience with cancer.</p>
<p>That being said, so is <em>The Emperor of All Maladies</em>. Cancer is itself extremely complicated but so is our response to cancer, because it embodies so much of what’s really challenging and fascinating and terrifying about the human experience.</p>
<p>It is so capricious, it is so unfair, it is so arbitrary. As much as we’d like narratives to make sense in human lives – as much as we’d like to know that ‘you’ll die from X if you do Y’ the truth of human health and human lives is much more complicated than that.</p>
<p>Cancer challenges that notion that things happen to people because of something they do. Or that disease is something that attacks us from the outside. I think that’s part of why we thought for so long that cancer was a virus – that it just made sense. It had to be something that was coming for us instead of something that was inside us.</p>

<p><strong><em>Q: Any final thoughts?</em></strong></p>
<p>In closing, I would say that the story of cancer is extremely complex and that that it is shaping the lives of millions of people every day. We need to focus our resources and our energy in the best possible ways to try to make sure that we make real progress in the next ten years against cancer. I think that we have the opportunity to do that.</p>
<p>It has obviously proved to be an extremely challenging disease to treat and cure, but I think that the progress that we have made is real and I really, really believe that if we continue to invest in it and focus on it and make it a priority that we’re going to see in the next ten years greater progress than many of us may have even thought possible.</p>
