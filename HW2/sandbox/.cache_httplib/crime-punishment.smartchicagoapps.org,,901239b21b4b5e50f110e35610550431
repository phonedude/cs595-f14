    <p><b>Crime and Punishment in Chicago</b> is an index of data sources surrounding this criminal justice system as it is in Chicago. We track data sources from the commission of the crime all the way to prison. We aggregate sources of data, provide insight into how this data is generated, discuss how to get it, and expose what data is unavailable. </p>

      <h2>About the Project</h2>
<p><hr>
All over Chicago, every day, in every corner of our oblong city, people commit crimes. This project is an index of the data that documents these crimes and what, if any, response there is from the criminal justice system.</p>
<p>The documentation is immense. Some is published. Much of it is not. Our goal is to create a flat, simple guide to what is known and what is not. </p>
    </div>
    <div id="intro-paragraph" class="copy col-md-6">
      <h2>About the Data</h2>
<p><hr>
For each contact point with the law, we divide the data that is known to be collected into three catagories based on its accessibility. Data marked "Open" is data that can be accessed online for free without prior permission. Data marked "FOIA" is data that can be requested under Illinois' Freedom of Information Act. We also have a category for data is confirmed to be inaccessible even through the FOIA.</p>

</tr>

    <th>FOIA</th>
