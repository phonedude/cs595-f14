	<h2 class="article-excerpt" itemprop="alternativeHeadline">How an unlikely group of high-tech wizards revived Obama's troubled HealthCare.gov website</h2>
    <p>Last Oct. 17&mdash;more than two weeks after the launch of HealthCare.gov&mdash;White House press secretary Jay Carney was going through what one senior Obama aide calls &ldquo;probably the most painful press briefing we&rsquo;ve ever seen.&rdquo; Pressed repeatedly on when the site would be fixed, the best he could say was that &ldquo;they are making improvements every day.&rdquo;</p>
 
<p>&ldquo;They&rdquo; were, in fact, not making improvements, except by chance, much as you or I might reboot or otherwise play with a laptop to see if some shot in the dark somehow fixes a snafu. Yet barely six weeks later, HealthCare.gov was working well and on its way to working even better.</p>
 
<p>This is the story of a team of unknown&mdash;except in elite technology circles&mdash;coders and troubleshooters who dropped what they were doing in various enterprises across the country and came together in mid-October to save the website. In about a tenth of the time that a crew of usual-suspect, Washington contractors had spent over $300 million building a site that didn&rsquo;t work, this ad hoc team rescued it and, arguably, Obama&rsquo;s chance at a health-reform legacy.</p><div class="issue-date">This appears in the March 10, 2014 issue of TIME.</div>

than two weeks after the launch of HealthCare.gov&mdash;White House press secretary Jay Carney was going through what one senior Obama aide calls &ldquo;probably the most painful press briefing we&rsquo;ve ever seen.&rdquo; Pressed repeatedly on when the site would be fixed, the best he could say was that &ldquo;they are making improvements every day.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n \r\n<p>&ldquo;They&rdquo; were, in fact, not making improvements, except by chance, much as you or I might reboot or otherwise play with a laptop to see if some shot in the dark somehow fixes a snafu. Yet barely six weeks later, HealthCare.gov was working well and on its way to working even better.<\/p>\r\n \r\n<p>This is the story of a team of unknown&mdash;except in elite technology circles&mdash;coders and troubleshooters who dropped what they were doing in various enterprises across the country and came together in mid-October to save the website. In about a tenth of the time that a crew of usual-suspect, Washington contractors had spent over $300 million building a site that didn&rsquo;t work, this ad hoc team rescued it and, arguably, Obama&rsquo;s chance at a health-reform legacy.<\/p><div class=\"issue-date\">This appears in the March 10, 2014 issue of TIME.<\/div>","section":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/politics\/","description":"Political insight from the Beltway and beyond.

Obama will chair a UN Security Council summit Wednesday on the subject, where the international body is expected to pass a resolution establishing an international legal framework for addressing the spread of foreign fighters.<\/p>\n<p>Obama and other Administration officials have repeatedly warned about Americans or Europeans who have fought alongside ISIS potentially entering the United States and causing harm.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Well, with respect to the Americans who may be engaged in combat in Iraq and Syria, this is something that our national security agencies and counterterrorism team are taking very seriously,&#8221; National Security Advisor Susan Rice said Friday. &#8220;It&rsquo;s something we track closely. And we are doing obviously all that we can to both gather the necessary information and take the appropriate precautions to the greatest extent that we possibly can.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Another official highlighted the myriad ways in which the Administration can prevent foreign fighters from returning to the U.S., including placing them on no-fly lists, adding airport screening measures and seizing their passports. But the first official would not discuss the specific measures used to keep Americans who have fought alongside ISIS from returning to the U.S. &#8220;This is worked on a case by case basis,&#8221; the official said, &#8220;I defer to the FBI.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The official said the NCTC believes that 15,000 fighters from 80 countries have tried to fight in Iraq and Syria, including 2,000 Europeans and the more than 100 Americans.<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3418455\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/politics\/","description":"Political insight from the Beltway and beyond.

The new study, which is published in <em>JAMA<\/em>, lays out what these wide ranging effects on public health are.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a breakdown of how climate change will impact human health:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Heat-related health problems<\/strong><br \/>\nIn the researchers&#8217; findings, they report that heat-related deaths represent more fatalities than all other weather events combined, and the frequency of hot days is expected to increase across all U.S. cities. Other research, like a recent <a title=\"July CDC report\" href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3059855\/the-high-risks-of-high-summer-tempteratures\/\" target=\"_blank\">July CDC report<\/a> confirmed earlier this summer that heat-related health problems in the U.S. are growing. Since outdoor workers are impacted by heat, there are also significant economic-related implications&mdash;and by 2050s, the researchers report that workdays lost due to heat could reach 15 to 18% in South East Asia, Central America and West and Central Africa.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Respiratory problems<\/strong><br \/>\nClimate-related pollution can trigger respiratory problems, commonly due to poor air quality, as exhibited in large <a title=\"cities like Beijing\" href=\"http:\/\/healthland.time.com\/2012\/05\/16\/study-during-beijing-olympics-shows-how-pollution-harms-the-heart\/\" target=\"_blank\">cities like Beijing<\/a>. The researchers report that 43 million people in the U.S. alone live in places that are over the EPA&#8217;s health standards for fine particulate matter in the air, and that can come from forest fires, which are thought to increase as temperatures continue to rise and droughts are prolonged. Pollen is also thought to increase with climate change, which is terrible news for people with seasonal allergies.<\/p>\n<p><b>Infectious diseases<\/b><br \/>\nIn the U.S., diseases like West Nile, <a title=\"dengue fever\" href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/2823716\/dengue-fever-florida-mosquito-borne-disease-outbreak\/\" target=\"_blank\">dengue fever<\/a>, and <a title=\"chikungunya virus\" href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3059930\/cdc-reports-more-cases-of-mosquito-borne-chikungunya-virus\/\" target=\"_blank\">chikungunya virus<\/a> are increasing in warm and muggy states like Florida, and all three of those diseases are thought to have a connection to warmer temperatures. The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) says that the rise of temperatures and changes in rainfall patterns have contributed to longer summers, and therefore these diseases&mdash;which are insect-borne&mdash;have longer seasons.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Waterborne diseases<\/strong><br \/>\nClimate change is projected to continue to cause heavier rain events, and the researchers note that gastrointestinal disease among kids has been tied to heavy rain fall in both the U.S. and India. Earlier this summer, citizens in Michigan and Toledo, Ohio were <a title=\"banned from drinking tap water\" href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3079516\/toledos-contaminated-water-heres-what-went-wrong\/\" target=\"_blank\">banned from drinking tap water<\/a> after an algae bloom, caused in part by agricultural runoff, moved to the region&#8217;s water intake area and contaminated the drinking water.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Food insecurity<\/strong><br \/>\nAccording to the report, climate change is expected to lower global food production by 2% per decade, even as demand increases 14%.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Mental health problems<\/strong><br \/>\nThe researchers show that serious weather events caused by climate change like Hurricane Katrina can leave people feeling utterly hopeless, displaced, full of anxiety and even with symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder.<\/p>\n<p>In a <a title=\"corresponding editorial\" href=\"http:\/\/jama.jamanetwork.com\/article.aspx?doi=10.1001\/jama.2014.13094\" target=\"_blank\">corresponding editorial<\/a>, Dr. Howard Bauchner, the editor-in-chief of <em>JAMA<\/em>, and Dr. Phil Fontanarosa, the journal&#8217;s executive editor, write: &#8220;Understanding and characterizing this threat and educating the medical community, public, and policy makers are crucial if the health of the world&#8217;s population is to continue to improve during the latter half of the 21st century.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to solutions, the researchers say reducing greenhouse gas emissions is a critical step in gaining better health and more economic stability. Starting Tuesday, the UN will meet for its 2014 Climate Summit, and the hope among many is that global public health will be an issue brought to the table&mdash;and addressed on an international scale.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><div class=\"galleryContainer galleryContainer--embedded\" data-gallery=\"3399134\" data-size=\"default\"><\/div><\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3414449\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"Health","slug":"health","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/health\/","description":"The latest health news, trends, and commentary from TIME, covering medicine, mental health, diet, fitness, sex, aging, disease, healthcare, policy and more"},"tag":{"name":"Infectious Disease","slug":"infectious-disease","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tag\/infectious-disease\/"},"tags":"climate change|Deforestation|dengue fever|Fossil fuels|heat-related illness|Infectious Disease|respiratory disease|tropical disease","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/climate-change.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/climate-change.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/climate-change.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/climate-change.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/climate-change.jpg?w=1100"},"credit":"Spaces Images&mdash;Getty Images\/Blend Images","caption":"","alt":"186366687"},"id":3414449,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3414449%2F6-ways-climate-change-is-making-us-sick%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1mo6qHo","encoded_title":"6+Ways+Climate+Change+is+Making+Us+Sick","galleries":[{"id":3399134,"slug":"air-pollution-climate-change-bakersfield-caifornia","title":"See the Worst Place to Breathe in America","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/3399134\/air-pollution-climate-change-bakersfield-caifornia\/","type":"normal","hidecount":false,"fullscreen":true,"counterfullscreen":true,"adfrequency":0,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3399134%2Fair-pollution-climate-change-bakersfield-caifornia%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1s8ZznO","encoded_title":"See+the+Worst+Place+to+Breathe+in+America","twitter_via":"TIMEHealth","email_title":"See%20the%20Worst%20Place%20to%20Breathe%20in%20America","hasAds":true,"twitter_text":"See%20the%20worst%20place%20to%20breathe%20in%20America","fb_text":"See%20the%20worst%20place%20to%20breathe%20in%20America","email_body":"It%27s%20not%20Los%20Angeles","size":"default","galleries":[{"id":3415610,"title":"See Thousands March for Climate Change","image":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/2014-09-21t184541z_907000739_gm1ea9m02.jpg?w=550&h=367&crop=1","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/3415610\/peoples-climate-march-new-york\/"},{"id":3398725,"title":"Pictures of the Week: Sept. 12 \u2013 Sept. 19","image":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/51eb54e5155642cbb82963eee7372fac-01.jpg?w=550&h=367&crop=1","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/3398725\/pictures-of-the-week-sept-12\/"},{"id":3386207,"title":"See California's Worst Week of Wildfires","image":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/california-wildfire-1.jpg?w=550&h=367&crop=1","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/3386207\/california-wildfire-photos\/"},{"id":3373483,"title":"See The 10 Funniest Faces of Past Miss America Winners ","image":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/miss-america-funny-faces-01.jpg?w=550&h=367&crop=1","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/3373483\/see-the-10-funniest-faces-of-past-miss-america-winners\/"},{"id":3328813,"title":"Pictures of the Week: Sept. 5 -

The iPhone 6 starts at $199 on a two-year carrier contract at 16GB, while the iPhone 6 Plus (the phone with an even larger screen)&ndash;starts at $299 for 16 GB.<\/p>\n<p>For those keeping track, the sales milestone isn&rsquo;t a huge leap from a year ago: Apple in September 2013 said it sold <a href=\"http:\/\/www.apple.com\/pr\/library\/2013\/09\/23First-Weekend-iPhone-Sales-Top-Nine-Million-Sets-New-Record.html\" target=\"_blank\">nine million iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c models, at the time a record<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The latest launch kicked off on Friday across a handful of markets, including the U.S., Japan and the U.K., with more markets to be added this Friday. Apple expects to sell its newest iPhones in 115 countries by the end of the year.<br \/>\n<div class=\"galleryContainer galleryContainer--embedded\" data-gallery=\"3403734\" data-size=\"default\"><\/div><br \/>\nApple&rsquo;s product launches typically generate strong early sales results and a lot of buzz&ndash;videos and news stories often focus on the long lines outside the electronics behemoth&rsquo;s retail stores. Apple often touts such buzz, and even in the company press statement on Monday, CEO Tim Cook hinted demand was too hot to handle by saying &ldquo;We could have sold many more iPhones with greater supply and we are working hard to fill orders as quickly as possible.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Though Apple continues to churn out strong sales, the company has also been ceding some market share in the worldwide smartphone market as other rivals produce low-cost smartphones, which contrasts with Apple&rsquo;s strategy to focus on more premium-priced gadgets. Apple&rsquo;s worldwide smartphone market share, in terms of units shipped, stood at 1<a href=\"http:\/\/www.idc.com\/prodserv\/smartphone-market-share.jsp\" target=\"_blank\">1.7% in the second quarter of this year<\/a>, down from 18.8% in the same quarter in 2011, according to research firm International Data Corporation. Samsung&rsquo;s smartphones have taken some of Apple&rsquo;s market share, though even that company has faced pressure as more affordable options hit shelves.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/22\/apple-smartphone-sales\/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>This article originally appeared on Fortune.com<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-pos=\"2\"><object id=\"bc-video-3776364373001-2\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#000000\"><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"1847503743001\"><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/ti.me\/1tUu9jV\"><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"TIME_onTemplateLoad\"><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"TIME_onTemplateReady\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"><param name=\"htmlFallback\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"3776364373001\"><\/object><\/div>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3418181\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"Tech","slug":"tech","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tech\/","description":"Technology news, reviews, how-to's and analysis of smartphones, tablets, computers, apps, video games, streaming media, innovation, social networks and more"},"tag":{"name":"Companies","slug":"companies","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tag\/companies\/"},"tags":"Companies","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"http:\/\/i2.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/apple-iphone-61.jpg?crop=1081px%2C0px%2C1919px%2C1919px&resize=100%2C100","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/apple-iphone-61.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/apple-iphone-61.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/apple-iphone-61.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/apple-iphone-61.jpg?w=1100"},"credit":"Vincent Yu\u2014AP","caption":"People wait to buy the new Apple iPhone 6 and 6 Plus devices outside an Apple store in Hong Kong on Sept. 19, 2014.

Read the article below originally published at <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/22\/alibaba-is-officially-the-biggest-ipo-ever-after-green-shoe-released\/\" target=\"_blank\">Fortune.com<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>By Laura Lorenzetti<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Alibaba Group&rsquo;s record-breaking initial public offering is worth $25 billion after bankers released additional shares, commonly referred to as the &ldquo;green shoe.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Bankers leading Alibaba&rsquo;s IPO maximized the size of the deal by issuing about 48 million additional shares, pushing up the offering value of the Chinese Internet giant. Alibaba surpassed Agricultural Bank of China&rsquo;s $24.3 billion IPO to become the biggest ever.<\/p>\n<p>The &ldquo;green shoe&rdquo; option allows bankers to sell more shares from the company in order to cover high investor demand. Had the IPO not attracted so many enthusiastic investors, the additional shares likely wouldn&rsquo;t have been tapped, leaving Alibaba&rsquo;s offering total at the original $21.8 billion.<\/p>\n<p>Alibaba priced its IPO<a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/09\/18\/alibaba-delivers-on-biggest-u-s-ipo-with-21-8-billion-offering\/\" target=\"_blank\"> at $68 share to initially become the biggest U.S. offering ever<\/a>. Its shares then opened over 36% higher than the offering price at $92.70 and finished out the first day of trading at $93.89.<\/p>\n<p>The first-day pop was nearly two-times higher than usual. Most IPOs open 15% higher than the offering price, according to David Ethridge, head of capital markets for the New York Stock Exchange.<\/p>\n<p>After its first day of trading, Alibaba&rsquo;s market value is $231.4 billion, larger than other industry standard bearers like Amazon, Facebook and Twitter.<\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-pos=\"3\"><object id=\"bc-video-3788062408001-3\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#000000\"><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"1847503743001\"><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/ti.me\/1C4lGNq\"><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"TIME_onTemplateLoad\"><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"TIME_onTemplateReady\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"><param name=\"htmlFallback\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"3788062408001\"><\/object><\/div>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3418260\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"Business","slug":"business","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/business\/","description":"The latest news and commentary from TIME on domestic and global business, the economy, technology, personal finance, banking, marketing, management and more"},"tag":{"name":"Companies","slug":"companies","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tag\/companies\/"},"tags":"Companies","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"http:\/\/i0.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/alibaba-ipo-biggest-ever.jpg?crop=1002px%2C700px%2C246px%2C246px&resize=100%2C100","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/alibaba-ipo-biggest-ever.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/alibaba-ipo-biggest-ever.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/alibaba-ipo-biggest-ever.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/alibaba-ipo-biggest-ever.jpg?w=1100"},"credit":"Andrew Burton&mdash;Getty Images","caption":"Alibaba Group signage is posted outside the New York Stock Exchange prior to the company's initial price offering (IPO) on September 19, 2014 in New York City.","alt":"China-Based Internet Company Alibaba Debuts On New York Stock Exchange"},"id":3418260,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3418260%2Falibaba-biggest-ipo%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1C4lGNq","encoded_title":"Alibaba+Is+Officially+the+Biggest+IPO+Ever+After+Additional+Shares+Sold","twitter_text":"Alibaba%20is%20officially%20the%20biggest%20IPO%20ever%20after%20additional%20shares%20sold","twitter_via":"TIMEBusiness","ads":{"neg":"false","post_title":"Alibaba Is Officially the Biggest IPO Ever After Additional Shares Sold"},"Partner_Module":{"partner":"Fortune","post_title":"Alibaba Is Officially the Biggest IPO Ever After Additional Shares Sold"},"email_title":"Alibaba%20Is%20Officially%20the%20Biggest%20IPO%20Ever%20After%20Additional%20Shares%20Sold%20%7C%20TIME","email_body":"Alibaba%20Is%20Officially%20the%20Biggest%20IPO%20Ever%20After%20Additional%20Shares%20Sold%0A%0AMore%20shares%20were%20sold%20in%20order%20to%20cover%20high%20investor%20demand%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3418260%2Falibaba-biggest-ipo%2F","omniture":{"modules":"rr-taboola-video|rr-ad"}},{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/3418350\/ebola-nigeria-senegal-who\/","right_now":true,"shortlink":"http:\/\/ti.me\/1DsGwIb","title":"Ebola &#8216;Pretty Much Contained&#8217; in Senegal and Nigeria","post_type":"post","time_article":true,"comments_allowed":true,"short_title":"Ebola Is 'Pretty Much Contained' in Senegal and Nigeria","excerpt":"Good news for containment of an outbreak that has killed more than 2,800 people","format":"brief","time":{"pretty":"11:04 AM ET","published":"2014-09-22 11:04:25","updated":"2014-09-22 15:04:25","minute":"11:04 am","short":"11:04 AM ET"},"authors":[{"id":207020909,"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/author\/alexandra-sifferlin\/","name":"Alexandra Sifferlin","bio":"Alexandra Sifferlin is a reporter for TIME covering all things health-related.

The good folks at <a href=\"http:\/\/ifixit.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">iFixit<\/a> decided to find out. And they did it the only way they know how &ndash; by completely disassembling both phones to see how they&rsquo;re put together.<\/p>\n<p>Overall, the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus were awarded repairability ratings of 7 out of 10, scores that the folks at iFixit call &ldquo;respectable.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s the highest an Apple phone has ever scored &ndash; last year&rsquo;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.techlicious.com\/review\/review-of-the-iphone-5s\/\">iPhone 5S<\/a> and iPhone 5C both scored <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ifixit.com\/Teardown\/iPhone+5s+Teardown\/17383\" target=\"_blank\">6 out of 10<\/a>. The iPhone 6 also scored better than its biggest competition: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.techlicious.com\/blog\/ifixit-samsung-galaxy-s5-teardown-results\/\">Samsung&rsquo;s Galaxy S5<\/a> earned a sub-par repairability score of just 5 out of 10.<\/p>\n<p>What did iFixit like about the new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus? Specifically, the site notes that the display comes out of the phone first, which makes repairing it much easier. That&rsquo;s no small point, given that screen replacements are among the most common of iPhone repairs. iFixit also says that the battery is &ldquo;straightforward to access,&rdquo; another important point given that battery replacements are commonplace, too. The fingerprint sensor cable has been moved to a safer location than in the iPhone 5S, better protecting it from tears when exposed.<\/p>\n<p>On the down side, both iPhone 6 phones use proprietary Penatlobe screws that you&rsquo;ll need a special tool to remove. There&rsquo;s adhesive to deal with in the repair process too, though iFixit calls removing it &ldquo;not difficult,&rdquo; unlike <a href=\"http:\/\/www.techlicious.com\/blog\/ipad-air-criticized-as-incredibly-difficult-to-repair\/\">the mess hiding<\/a> behind the screen of an iPad Air. Apple also gets dinged for not sharing info on repairing the device with independent shops, though given the results of this teardown, most should be able to easily figure out how to make common repairs on their own.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to learn more, you can read the full teardown description of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ifixit.com\/Teardown\/iPhone+6+Teardown\/29213\" target=\"_blank\">iPhone 6<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ifixit.com\/Teardown\/iPhone+6+Plus+Teardown\/29206\" target=\"_blank\">iPhone 6 Plus<\/a> at the iFixit website.

All children were given either a flash cue, a beep cue or a combination of both, and asked to press a button when these stimuli occurred. A cap with 70 sensors picked up the children&rsquo;s brain responses every two milliseconds during these tasks, including those that recorded how the brain first processed the sensory information.<\/p>\n<p><strong>MORE:<\/strong> <a href=\"http:\/\/healthland.time.com\/2012\/10\/26\/behavior-therapy-normalizes-brains-of-autistic-children\/\" target=\"_blank\">Behavior Therapy Normalizes Brains of Autistic Children<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The children with autism showed a distinctly different brain wave signature from those without the condition. Specifically, the signals in those with autism showed differences in the speed in which the sights or sounds were processed, and in how the sensory neurons recruited neighbors in more far-flung areas of the brain to register and make sense of the information. And the more abnormal this multi-processing was, the more severe the child&rsquo;s autistic symptoms. &ldquo;By developing this tool in the older cohort of children we can then figure out which ones are the most promising and then go test them in younger children,&rdquo; says Molholm.<\/p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s also possible that because the children she studied were older, the differences in their EEG patterns were the result of autism, rather than a sign of changes that precede the disorder. But, she says, &ldquo;If you ask me to make an educated guess, I would say these are part of autism, and they represent neuropathology related to having the disorder. It seems unlikely to me that you get autism and then develop atypical auditory processing.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p><strong>MORE:<\/strong> <a title=\"Autism Symptoms Disappeared With Behavioral Therapy In Babies\" href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3305027\/autism-symptoms-disappeared-with-behavioral-therapy-in-babies\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"item-title\">Autism Symptoms Disappeared With Behavioral Therapy In Babies<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Molholm says the sample was too small to use the profile for diagnosing autism, but it could lead to such a test if the results are confirmed and repeated. To confirm the findings, scientists will have to intervene with behavioral strategies for helping the different regions of the brain work in a more coordinated way when confronted with visual and auditory cues. If that reduces autism symptoms, then EEG profiling could become one of a number of new ways that doctors can start identifying those at highest risk &ndash; however young &#8212; of developing autism.<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3418469\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"Health","slug":"health","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/health\/","description":"The latest health news, trends, and commentary from TIME, covering medicine, mental health, diet, fitness, sex, aging, disease, healthcare, policy and more"},"tag":{"name":"Developmental Disorders","slug":"developmental-disorders","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tag\/developmental-disorders\/"},"tags":"Autism|Brain|Developmental Disorders|diagnosing autism","id":3418469,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3418469%2Fdiagnosing-autism-brain-waves%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1uZfp2w","encoded_title":"Diagnosing+Autism+with+Brain+Waves","twitter_text":"Diagnosing%20autism%20using%20brain%20waves","twitter_via":"TIMEHealth","ads":{"neg":"false","post_title":"Diagnosing Autism with Brain Waves"},"Partner_Module":{"partner":"Select","post_title":"Diagnosing Autism with Brain Waves"},"email_title":"Diagnosing%20Autism%20with%20Brain%20Waves%20%7C%20TIME","email_body":"Diagnosing%20Autism%20with%20Brain%20Waves%0A%0AUnique%20EEG%20fingerprints%20reveal%20how%20autistic%20brains%20process%20sights%20and%20sounds%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3418469%2Fdiagnosing-autism-brain-waves%2F","omniture":{"modules":"rr-taboola-video|rr-partner|rr-ad"}},{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/3418545\/kirsten-gillibrand-daniel-inouye\/","shortlink":"http:\/\/ti.me\/XX2PVr","title":"Gillibrand\u2019s Harasser Revealed as Late Hawaii Senator","post_type":"post","time_article":true,"comments_allowed":true,"short_title":"Gillibrand\u2019s Harasser Revealed as Late Hawaii Senator","excerpt":"Report indicates it was Daniel Inouye","format":"brief","time":{"pretty":"11:55 AM ET","published":"2014-09-22 11:55:19","updated":"2014-09-22 15:55:19","minute":"11:55 am","short":"11:55 AM ET"},"authors":[{"id":207016060,"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/author\/jay-newton-small\/","name":"Jay Newton-Small","bio":"Jay Newton-Small is the congressional correspondent for TIME.

Then came up with an answer she deemed a trump card.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s so shiny!&rdquo; she exclaimed. The teacher sighed. She nodded slightly, but was called to help another student before she could re-explain the objective.<\/p>\n<p>The FAIR test (Florida Assessments for Instruction in Reading) is given to students grades K-2. It is supposed to take 35 minutes per student, but <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/susan.bowles.96\/posts\/689131181156232\">often takes up to an hour<\/a>. It is given during class time at the beginning of the year and then twice more throughout the year. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fldoe.org\/classsize\/\">Each class has 18 students<\/a> in it, and this year the teacher is required to sit with each one, devoting that hour to the individual student while another teacher, who has her own class to attend to, wrangles all the other students. This means the total time for test administration is 13 hours for one class plus 13 hours for the other class (as they&rsquo;ve combined teachers). During that time, little to no actual instruction can take place. The assessment period, therefore, takes the first two weeks of school.<\/p>\n<p>From a parental standpoint, it was a nightmare. Why should my kids miss out on instruction to take a rote test that doesn&rsquo;t seem to measure anything?<\/p>\n<p>This year, teacher Susan Bowles of Chiles-Lawton Elementary School in Gainesville put her job on the line by refusing to give the test to her students. Parents around the county gave her a metaphorical standing ovation.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I know I may be in breach of my contract by not administering this test,&rdquo; she wrote in a Facebook note to parents of her class. &ldquo;I cannot in good conscience submit to administering this test three times a year, losing six weeks of instruction. There is a good possibility I will be fired.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Letters of support came pouring in to the Superintendent&rsquo;s office for Bowles, who had made it clear the issue was not with school officials, but with the government mandates for testing here in Florida.<\/p>\n<p>On Sept. 11 of this year, I received an email from Owen Roberts, Superintendent of Alachua County Schools, in which he stated his support for Bowles, but asked parents to go to their local legislators to enact the change we all wish to see in regard to standardized testing.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I have met personally with Mrs. Bowles,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;and the district has heard from parents praising her as an excellent teacher. I certainly appreciate her concerns regarding FAIR testing. I have said clearly and publicly that I believe there is too much standardized testing here in Florida, and that much of it doesn&rsquo;t offer a significant educational benefit for children.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;However, Florida law requires that all kindergarten students take the FAIR test during the first 30 days of school. Until the law changes, the district is obligated to administer the test.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>But the problems remain. Bowles stated in her note that the testing requirements have been increasing each year, yet the school budgets have not been given a boost to accommodate the changes. Teachers are expected to give the tests with no support. And things get lost. Important things.<\/p>\n<p>Last weekend, I taught my twins, now in first grade, how to write a &ldquo;g&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s not that they weren&rsquo;t writing them at all, but because so much teaching time has been lost to testing, the kids are left to their own devices to build the basic blocks of learning, so that the teachers can keep up with the rigorous curriculum. My children, being adaptive and wily, devised their own ways to write the letters of the alphabet without formal instruction (other than what I&rsquo;d taught them when they were four, the summer before school.) To write a &ldquo;g&rdquo;, my kids would draw a straight line down, then draw a little circle on top of the line, then make a tiny curve at the bottom of the line. It seems like no big deal, but when that is multiplied by every letter they have to write for every assignment, it ends up taking at least three times as long. My children were not finishing their work.<\/p>\n<p>My kids work hard. I promise you, Florida, they do. And if we can&rsquo;t trust our teachers to do their jobs, and to assess our kids given their expertise and experience in the field&mdash;if we ask them to give up their vocation to instead administer online tests and teach babies to bubble in the dots so that some machine can spit out a statistic to tell our state if we&rsquo;re smart enough to get money to get smarter&mdash;we are doing a disservice to our children. We are no longer teaching them at all.<\/p>\n<p>The good news is that Bowles&rsquo; stand, though a shot in the dark, helped to push an already growing unrest to its boiling point. Instead of losing her job, or having the state push the event under the rug, on Sept. 15 I received this email relaying a message from Florida&rsquo;s Commissioner of Education Pam Stewart.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;&hellip;in light of the technical difficulties schools and teachers here in Alachua County and throughout the state have experienced with the FAIR test, the test will not be required for kindergarten screening within the first 30 days of school for this school year. In fact, FAIR testing will not continue for any students in grades K-2.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>We won. Susan Bowles won. Our students won. If this David-and-Goliath story doesn&rsquo;t light the hearts of parents and teachers around the nation, and solidify efforts to teach our children, not test them, I don&rsquo;t know what will. Alachua County has shown that we can make a difference. We just have to try.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em>Darlena Cunha is a Florida-based contributor to <\/em>The Washington Post<em> and TIME among dozens of other publications.

But the one with the biggest nose? Somehow, it just doesn&#8217;t have the same impact.<\/p>\n<p>Yet that&#8217;s what a team of paleontologists <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/14772019.2014.950614#.VB9n_CtdUxg\" target=\"_blank\">are reporting<\/a> in the <i>Journal of Systematic Palaeontology. <\/i>The newly described dino is a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ucmp.berkeley.edu\/diapsids\/ornithischia\/hadrosauria.html\" target=\"_blank\">hadrosaur<\/a>, the group that includes the so-called duck-billed dinosaurs. Many of these plant-eating creatures sported huge bony crests atop their heads.<\/p>\n<p>Not this one. &#8220;&#8230;instead,&#8221; reads a press release announcing the discovery, and calling a spade a spade, &#8220;this dinosaur has a huge nose.&#8221; What else to call it but <em>Rhinorex<\/em>, or &#8220;King Nose.&#8221; It was, says the release, the &#8220;Jimmy Durante of dinosaurs.&#8221; (If you&#8217;re under 50 or so, you&#8217;ll have to <a href=\"http:\/\/content.time.com\/time\/specials\/packages\/article\/0,28804,1968770_1968778_1969031,00.html\" target=\"_blank\">lo0k it up<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p>The obvious question is: why would a dinosaur need a gigantic nose? We know why <em>T. Rex<\/em> sported long, dagger-like teeth and velociraptors needed razor-sharp claws. It&#8217;s clear why <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nps.gov\/dino\/naturescience\/apatosaurus-louisae.htm\" target=\"_blank\">apatosaurus<\/a>&mdash;better known to many, including <a href=\"http:\/\/content.time.com\/time\/subscriber\/article\/0,33009,871711,00.html\" target=\"_blank\">Fred Flintstone<\/a>, as brontosaurus&mdash;had such a long neck (like the giraffe&#8217;s, it was for more effective browsing).<\/p>\n<p>But paleontologists Terry Gates of North Carolina State University and Rodney Sheetz of Brigham Young, who found the fossil embedded in sandstone in a Brigham Young Museum of Paleontology storage area, haven&#8217;t got a clue. It probably wasn&#8217;t for smell, but more likely for easy recognition by others of its species, or for knocking down edible plants, or&mdash;strange though it might sound&mdash;attracting mates.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We are already sniffing out answers to these questions,&#8221; Gates said in a statement.
