The leaders of the free world, meanwhile, are struggling to find the right terminology to free themselves from the moral responsibility to provide that protection. Putin&rsquo;s bloody invasion of a sovereign European nation is an incursion, much like Crimea &mdash; remember Crimea? &mdash; was an &ldquo;uncontested arrival&rdquo; instead of <em>anschluss</em>. A civilian airliner was blown out of the sky just six weeks ago &mdash; remember MH17? &mdash; and with more than 100 victims still unidentified, the outrage has already dissipated into polite discussions about whether it should be investigated as a crime, a war crime or neither.</p>

Moscow&rsquo;s smoke screens are hardly necessary in the face of so much willful blindness. Putin&rsquo;s lies are obvious and expected. European leaders and the White House are even more eager than the Kremlin to pretend this conflict is local and so requires nothing more than vague promises from a very safe distance. As George Orwell wrote in his 1946 essay on language right before starting work on his novel <em>1984</em> (surely not a coincidence): &ldquo;But if thought corrupts language, language can also corrupt thought.&rdquo; The Western rhetoric of appeasement creates a self-reinforcing loop of mental and moral corruption. Speaking the truth now would mean confessing to many months of lies, just as it took years for Western leaders to finally admit Putin didn&rsquo;t belong in the G-7 club of industrialized democracies.</p>

Generic wishes about &ldquo;mobilizing the international community&rdquo; were bad enough six months ago. Hearing them repeated as Ukrainian towns fall to Russian troops is a parody. (If legitimacy is what Obama is after, Russia is clearly in violation of nearly every point of the 1974 U.N. Resolution 3314, &ldquo;definition of aggression.&rdquo;) Perhaps Poroshenko should have matched Obama&rsquo;s casual wardrobe by wearing a T-shirt that read, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a War, Stupid.&rdquo; As Russian tanks and artillery push back the overmatched Ukrainian forces, Obama&rsquo;s repeated insistence that there is no military solution in Ukraine sounds increasingly delusional. There is no time to teach a drowning man to swim.</p>
<p>The U.S., Canada and even Europe have responded to Putin&rsquo;s aggression, it is true, but always a few moves behind, always after the deterrent potential of each action had passed. Strong sanctions and a clear demonstration of support for Ukrainian territorial integrity (as I recommended at the time) would have had real impact when Putin moved on Crimea in February and March. A sign that there would be real consequences would have split his elites as they pondered the loss of their coveted assets in New York City and London.</p>
<p>Then in April and May, the supply of defensive military weaponry would have forestalled the invasion currently under way, or at least raised its price considerably &mdash; making the Russian public a factor in the Kremlin&rsquo;s decisionmaking process much earlier. Those like me who called for such aid at the time were called warmongers, and policymakers again sought dialogue with Putin. And yet war has arrived regardless, as it always does in the face of weakness.</p>
<p>As one of the pioneers of the analogy I feel the irony in how it has quickly gone from scandal to clich&eacute; to compare Putin to Hitler, for better and for worse. Certainly Putin&rsquo;s arrogance and language remind us more and more of Hitler&rsquo;s, as does how well he has been rewarded for them. For this he can thank the overabundance of Chamberlains in the halls of power today &mdash; and there is no Churchill in sight.</p>
<p>As long as it is easy, as long as Putin moves from victory to victory without resistance, he gains more support. He took Crimea with barely a shot fired. He flooded eastern Ukraine with agents and weaponry while Europe dithered. The oligarchs who might have pressured Putin at the start of his Ukrainian adventure are now war criminals with no way back. The pressure points now are harder to reach.</p>
<p>The Russian military commanders, the ones in the field, are not fools. They are aware that NATO is watching and could blow them to bits in a moment. They rely on Putin&rsquo;s aura of invincibility, which grows every day the West refuses to provide Ukraine with military support. Those commanders must be made to understand that they are facing an overwhelming force, that their lives are in grave danger, that they can and will be captured and prosecuted. To make this a credible threat requires immediate military aid, if not yet the &ldquo;boots on the ground&rdquo; everyone but Putin is so keen to avoid. If NATO nations refuse to send lethal aid to Ukraine now it will be yet another green light to Putin.</p>
<p>Sanctions are still an important tool, and those directly responsible for commanding this war, such as Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu must be held accountable. Sanctions must also broaden. The chance to limit them only to influential individuals and companies is over. The Russian people can change Putin&rsquo;s course but have little incentive to take the great risks to do so under current conditions. Only sanctions that bring the costs of Putin&rsquo;s war home can have an impact now. This was always a last resort, and it wouldn&rsquo;t be necessary had the West not reacted with such timidity at every step. (The other factor that is already dimming the Russian people&rsquo;s fervor is the Russian military casualties the Kremlin propaganda machine is trying so hard to cover up.)</p>
<p>As always when it comes to stopping dictators, with every delay the price goes up. Western leaders have protested over the potential costs of action Ukraine at every turn only to be faced with the well-established historical fact that the real costs of inaction are always higher. Now the only options left are risky and difficult, and yet they must be tried. The best reason for acting to stop Putin today is brutally simple: it will only get harder tomorrow.</p>

Moscow&rsquo;s smoke screens are hardly necessary in the face of so much willful blindness. Putin&rsquo;s lies are obvious and expected. European leaders and the White House are even more eager than the Kremlin to pretend this conflict is local and so requires nothing more than vague promises from a very safe distance. As George Orwell wrote in his 1946 essay on language right before starting work on his novel <em>1984<\/em> (surely not a coincidence): &ldquo;But if thought corrupts language, language can also corrupt thought.&rdquo; The Western rhetoric of appeasement creates a self-reinforcing loop of mental and moral corruption. Speaking the truth now would mean confessing to many months of lies, just as it took years for Western leaders to finally admit Putin didn&rsquo;t belong in the G-7 club of industrialized democracies.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-mag\" data-name=\"rr-mag\"><div class=\"read-more-inline magazine has-cover\"><h6 class=\"read-more-list-h read-more-popular\">Popular Among Subscribers<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"popular-lead\"><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3397085\/the-tragic-risks-of-american-football\/?pcd=pw-pas\"><img src=\"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/football-cover1.jpg?w=560\" alt=\"Chad Stover Football Time Magazine Cover\" title=\"\" data-loaded=\"true\"><\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3397085\/the-tragic-risks-of-american-football\/?pcd=pw-pas\" class=\"read-more-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"read-more-inline-title time-icons time-icons-key\">The Tragic Risks of American Football<\/h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/subscription.time.com\/storefront\/subscribe-to-time\/link\/1019509.html\" class=\"subscribe-button\">Subscribe<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3397067\/u2s-mission-to-save-music\/?pcd=pw-pas\" class=\"read-more-article\" format-article><h3 class=\"read-more-inline-title time-icons time-icons-key\">U2\u2019s Mission to Save Music<\/h3><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3397062\/the-rise-of-concealed-weapons-in-america\/?pcd=pw-pas\" class=\"read-more-article\" format-article><h3 class=\"read-more-inline-title time-icons time-icons-key\">The Rise of Concealed Weapons in America<\/h3><\/a><\/div><\/aside><p>Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko just met with U.S. President Barack Obama in Washington, but Obama&rsquo;s subsequent statement showed no sign he&rsquo;s willing to acknowledge reality. Generic wishes about &ldquo;mobilizing the international community&rdquo; were bad enough six months ago. Hearing them repeated as Ukrainian towns fall to Russian troops is a parody. (If legitimacy is what Obama is after, Russia is clearly in violation of nearly every point of the 1974 U.N. Resolution 3314, &ldquo;definition of aggression.&rdquo;) Perhaps Poroshenko should have matched Obama&rsquo;s casual wardrobe by wearing a T-shirt that read, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a War, Stupid.&rdquo; As Russian tanks and artillery push back the overmatched Ukrainian forces, Obama&rsquo;s repeated insistence that there is no military solution in Ukraine sounds increasingly delusional. There is no time to teach a drowning man to swim.<\/p>\n<p>The U.S., Canada and even Europe have responded to Putin&rsquo;s aggression, it is true, but always a few moves behind, always after the deterrent potential of each action had passed. Strong sanctions and a clear demonstration of support for Ukrainian territorial integrity (as I recommended at the time) would have had real impact when Putin moved on Crimea in February and March. A sign that there would be real consequences would have split his elites as they pondered the loss of their coveted assets in New York City and London.<\/p>\n<p>Then in April and May, the supply of defensive military weaponry would have forestalled the invasion currently under way, or at least raised its price considerably &mdash; making the Russian public a factor in the Kremlin&rsquo;s decisionmaking process much earlier. Those like me who called for such aid at the time were called warmongers, and policymakers again sought dialogue with Putin. And yet war has arrived regardless, as it always does in the face of weakness.<\/p>\n<p>As one of the pioneers of the analogy I feel the irony in how it has quickly gone from scandal to clich&eacute; to compare Putin to Hitler, for better and for worse. Certainly Putin&rsquo;s arrogance and language remind us more and more of Hitler&rsquo;s, as does how well he has been rewarded for them. For this he can thank the overabundance of Chamberlains in the halls of power today &mdash; and there is no Churchill in sight.<\/p>\n<p>As long as it is easy, as long as Putin moves from victory to victory without resistance, he gains more support. He took Crimea with barely a shot fired. He flooded eastern Ukraine with agents and weaponry while Europe dithered. The oligarchs who might have pressured Putin at the start of his Ukrainian adventure are now war criminals with no way back. The pressure points now are harder to reach.<\/p>\n<p>The Russian military commanders, the ones in the field, are not fools. They are aware that NATO is watching and could blow them to bits in a moment. They rely on Putin&rsquo;s aura of invincibility, which grows every day the West refuses to provide Ukraine with military support. Those commanders must be made to understand that they are facing an overwhelming force, that their lives are in grave danger, that they can and will be captured and prosecuted. To make this a credible threat requires immediate military aid, if not yet the &ldquo;boots on the ground&rdquo; everyone but Putin is so keen to avoid. If NATO nations refuse to send lethal aid to Ukraine now it will be yet another green light to Putin.<\/p>\n<p>Sanctions are still an important tool, and those directly responsible for commanding this war, such as Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu must be held accountable. Sanctions must also broaden. The chance to limit them only to influential individuals and companies is over. The Russian people can change Putin&rsquo;s course but have little incentive to take the great risks to do so under current conditions. Only sanctions that bring the costs of Putin&rsquo;s war home can have an impact now. This was always a last resort, and it wouldn&rsquo;t be necessary had the West not reacted with such timidity at every step. (The other factor that is already dimming the Russian people&rsquo;s fervor is the Russian military casualties the Kremlin propaganda machine is trying so hard to cover up.)<\/p>\n<p>As always when it comes to stopping dictators, with every delay the price goes up. Western leaders have protested over the potential costs of action Ukraine at every turn only to be faced with the well-established historical fact that the real costs of inaction are always higher. Now the only options left are risky and difficult, and yet they must be tried.

The Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution defining so-called &#8220;foreign terrorist fighters,&#8221; and providing an international legal framework for their prosecution.<\/p>\n<p>The resolution calls on member states to criminalize the travel, or attempt to travel, of individuals for the purpose of &#8220;the perpetration, planning, or preparation of, or participation in, terrorist acts, or the providing or receiving of terrorist training,&#8221; as well as raising funds or recruitment of fighters.<\/p>\n<p>The National Counterterrorism Center estimates that 15,000 fighters from 80 countries have or are currently fighting inside Syria, many alongside ISIS and the al-Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front, including 2,000 Europeans and over 100 Americans. Some of the Americans, officials said, have <a title=\"Some Americans Fighting With Terror Groups Have Returned to the U.S., Obama Administration Says\" href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3418455\/isis-isil-barack-obama-us\/\" target=\"_blank\">returned<\/a> to the United States.<\/p>\n<p>Senior U.S. administration officials said the resolution would create a framework for other countries to share passenger name records and other identifying information for suspected fighters, preventing them from traveling to conflict zones and from returning to their home countries if already there.<\/p>\n<p>In conjunction with the resolution, the U.S. designated ten individuals and two groups, many tied to ISIS, as Specially Designated Global Terrorists, subjecting them to U.S. sanctions.<\/p>\n<iframe class=\"scribd_iframe_embed\" src=\"http:\/\/www.scribd.com\/embeds\/240849621\/content?start_page=1&view_mode=&access_key=key-pLXnWYR75dUI50gwhhbk\" data-auto-height=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" id=\"scribd_240849621\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe>\n<div style=\"font-size:10px;text-align:center;width:100%\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.scribd.com\/doc\/240849621\">View this document on Scribd<\/a><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3426402\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"World","slug":"world","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/world\/","description":"The latest news and analysis from TIME's correspondents on world politics, diplomacy, conflict, culture, humanitarian disasters, religion and much more"},"tag":{"name":"United Nations","slug":"united-nations","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tag\/united-nations\/"},"tags":"United Nations","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/456039620.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/456039620.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/456039620.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/456039620.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/456039620.jpg?w=1100"},"credit":"Timothy A.

The study looked reported shootings between 2000 and 2013. The data, released Wednesday, showed that from 2000-2007, there was an average 6.4 active shooter incidents per year. From 2007 to 2013, however, the rate of incidences more than doubled, with an average of 16.4 events annually.<\/p>\n<p>All of the deadliest mass shootings&mdash;including the tragedies of Aurora, Virginia Tech, Ft. Hood, and Sandy Hook&mdash;occurred during that period. About 64 of the events tallied were identified as &ldquo;mass killings,&#8221; given that three or more people died in a single event.<\/p>\n<p>Though the study was not designed to identify motive in the incidences, it did reveal a number of &ldquo;shooter characteristics.&rdquo; According to the FBI, the mass shootings were carried out by one person in all but two incidents; the vast majority of school-shootings were carried out by students, and only six of all the shooters were women.<\/p>\n<p>The study&#8217;s authors noted that the data should be used to help aid law enforcement agents and the public in responding to such incidents, which have occurred in 40 out of 50 states and D.C. Though proper police response can save more lives, about 60% of the incidents studied were over before officers even arrived on the scene. The shootings in the study resulted in 1,043 people who were killed or wounded.<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3426549\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"U.S.","slug":"us","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/us\/","description":"The latest news and analysis on crime, religion, education, transportation, weather, immigration, sports, drugs, the law, and other news from around the nation"},"tag":{"name":"Crime","slug":"crime","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tag\/crime\/"},"tags":"Crime|Ft.

We still need more effort&mdash;it should not be limited to Iraq and ISIS. This is a threat not just to the Middle East but to the whole world . . . <\/span>I want to be clear with you that this ideology constitutes a problem. There&rsquo;s a fine line between extremism and killing. If we hadn&rsquo;t saved Egypt, there would have been a major problem created. The U.S. did not pay attention to that.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>On ousting Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood<\/b>: You dealt with the developments in Egypt as a movement by the military. But the military was not thinking of making a coup. It was the Egyptian people who demanded that change of identity . . . A country like Egypt caught in a vicious cycle of extremism would be a threat to the whole world. The U.S. would have felt the need to destroy Egypt.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">We have been fighting terrorism in the Sinai [Peninsula] for a year and four months. If the Muslim Brotherhood had been in office for another year, Sinai would have become something like Tora Bora [in Afghanistan]. It would have been civil war in Egypt. Egyptians wouldn&rsquo;t have stood still, [and] on the other side, the supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood were ready to fight.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>On Egypt&#8217;s domestic challenges: <\/b>Egypt has not faced problems of this scale for over 40 years. [We have] striking poverty, unemployment, idleness of the young people. This is fertile soil for problems. Our population growth is 2.6 million people a year. In 10 years time, we expect to have 30 million people more. This is a reason for the revolution in Egypt. They want change and to move forward to a brighter future. Unfortunately, Morsi did not deal with the magnitude of the problems. The government alone in Egypt won&rsquo;t be able to tackle all of the problems, [but] Egypt cannot afford to fail. Two revolutions is more than enough.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>On the future of the Muslim Brotherhood<\/b>: Our first elections were free and fair. The result of that free choice was the Muslim Brotherhood and the Muslim Brotherhood was accepted. But I say that in any election to be held [in the future] the Muslim Brotherhood will not be fortunate to have a share.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>On the risks of foreign jihadis in the battle against terrorism: <\/b>Watch out for your citizens who join jihad. When they come back to their communities, they will pursue the same practices. This is why we can&rsquo;t just limit the effort to the military. The actions taken over the past year are not enough to terminate this . . . No one country is immune to this ideology. The foreign fighters will come back to your country. I&rsquo;m afraid it will be disastrous.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>On the role of Islam in his life: <\/b>I simply represent moderate Islam. I&rsquo;m concerned about the chalenges of poverty and ignorance in the Muslim world. I can&rsquo;t be against Islam&mdash;I consider myself a devout Muslim&mdash;but the reality poses a challenge.<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3426794\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"World","slug":"world","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/world\/","description":"The latest news and analysis from TIME's correspondents on world politics, diplomacy, conflict, culture, humanitarian disasters, religion and much more"},"tag":{"name":"Egypt","slug":"egypt","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tag\/egypt\/"},"tags":"Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi|Egypt|Interview|Iraq|isis|Mohamed Morsi|Muslim Brotherhood|Syria|Terrorism|United Nations|World","hero":{"class":"wide","thumbnail":"http:\/\/i0.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/abdul-fattah-al-sisi.jpg?crop=433px%2C0px%2C1705px%2C1705px&resize=100%2C100","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/abdul-fattah-al-sisi.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/abdul-fattah-al-sisi.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/abdul-fattah-al-sisi.jpg?w=840","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/abdul-fattah-al-sisi.jpg?w=1680"},"credit":"Peter Hapak for TIME","caption":"President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi of Egypt in New York City on Sept. 23, 2014.

He declined to elaborate.<\/p>\n<p>Police have said the toddler was left in the vehicle for about seven hours on a day when temperatures in the Atlanta area reached at least into the high 80s. The medical examiner&#8217;s office has said the boy died of hyperthermia &mdash; essentially overheating &mdash; and called his death a homicide.<\/p>\n<p>Harris&#8217; attorney Maddox Kilgore did not immediately return a call seeking comment.<\/p>\n<p>Harris faces multiple charges, including malice murder, felony murder and cruelty to children. The malice murder charge indicates prosecutors intend to prove Harris intentionally left his 22-month-old son Cooper to die in the hot car.<\/p>\n<p>The eight-count indictment also includes charges related to sexually explicit exchanges prosecutors say Harris had with an underage girl.<\/p>\n<p>During a three-hour bond and probable cause hearing in July, Cobb County Assistant District Attorney Chuck Boring questioned a police detective at length, outlining evidence he said proved that Harris intentionally left his young boy in the hot SUV. Harris was sitting in his office exchanging nude photos with several women, including a teenager, the day his son died, Cobb County Police Detective Phil Stoddard testified at the hearing.<\/p>\n<p>The indictment also accuses Harris of asking a girl under the age of 18 to send him a nude photo and of sending nude photos of himself and sexually explicit messages to her. It charges him with attempting to sexually exploit a child and with disseminating harmful material to a minor.<\/p>\n<p>Harris&#8217; attorney has said the state has introduced several inconsistent theories about a potential motive in the boy&#8217;s death, which he has said was a terrible accident.<\/p>\n<p>Harris is a native of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and moved to Georgia in 2012 to work for Home Depot.<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3426726\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"U.S.","slug":"us","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/us\/","description":"The latest news and analysis on crime, religion, education, transportation, weather, immigration, sports, drugs, the law, and other news from around the nation"},"tag":{"name":"Crime","slug":"crime","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tag\/crime\/"},"tags":"Crime","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/06\/ap34413109056.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/06\/ap34413109056.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/06\/ap34413109056.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/06\/ap34413109056.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/06\/ap34413109056.jpg?w=799"},"credit":"AP","caption":"Justin Ross Harris in an undated photo released by the Cobb County (Ga.)

In June the group captured Mosul, Iraq&rsquo;s second largest city, and not long after it threatened Erbil, capital of the Kurdish region. The least subservient of the al-Qaeda branches, ISIS had early disagreements over strategy with Osama bin Laden. Both Sunni extremist groups were rooted in the hate-filled <i>dawah<\/i>&mdash;religious doctrine, curricular materials and money&mdash;that Saudi Arabia pumped out to the wider Muslim world to counter its Shi&lsquo;ite rival, postrevolutionary Iran.

Instead he embraced a strategy of conquering and holding territory and killing Shi&lsquo;ites. Bin Laden disapproved of that approach because it resulted in too many Muslim deaths, alienating potential supporters. Early this year, ISIS and al-Qaeda split for good.<\/p>\n<p>For many members of Congress and the commentariat, and even a couple of Cabinet members who mislaid their talking points, the distinction between the two groups didn&rsquo;t matter. ISIS&rsquo;s summer breakthrough meant a new, more technologically sophisticated version of al-Qaeda was coming. As one Senator declared, the President had to act &ldquo;before we all get killed back here at home.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The fear was exaggerated. ISIS represents a serious threat to Iraq and its region&mdash;which is reason enough for the Obama Administration to rally Sunni nations and others to combat it. But it is above all an insurgency, and the tools it knows are those of irregular combat, not al-Qaeda-style terrorism. It appears never to have plotted&mdash;and certainly never carried out&mdash;a long-distance, covert terrorist operation. As Matt Olsen, director of the National Counterterrorism Center, said in a little-noted speech, &ldquo;We have no credible information that ISIL is planning to attack the U.S.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>That can change. ISIS&rsquo;s ability to win and hold ground has generated real excitement among extremists worldwide, fueling unprecedented recruitment. Some sympathizers will feel impelled to show they too are part of the fight, as the plot to carry out beheadings in Australia demonstrates. The immense safe haven ISIS has carved out from Fallujah to Aleppo; the large sums of money it reaps from illicit oil sales, bank robberies and ransom payments; and the growing cadre of recruits from Europe and the U.S. add up to a possible future threat. No one should be misled: U.S. air strikes will likely hasten that possibility.<\/p>\n<p>The other U.S. target, the Khorasan group, is a danger right now. The group is more al-Qaeda 1.0 than ISIS. Its name refers to the land beyond Persia, the farthest reaches of Islam. Bin Laden announced from Afghanistan in 1996 in his first declaration of war against the U.S. that he had been hunted but had found that &ldquo;a safe base is now available in the high Hindu Kush mountains in Khorasan.&rdquo; The group has al-Qaeda 1.0 personnel in its ranks, and like al-Qaeda 1.0, it has the West in its sights. Amid the anarchy in Syria, the cell appears to have plotted to use bomb technology developed by al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula to target airliners. The bombs are variants of the hard-to-detect models that the Nigerian underwear bomber failed to detonate on a Northwest flight during Christmas 2009 and that an assassin blew himself up with in an attempt against the Saudi counterterrorism chief.<\/p>\n<p>So how great a threat do these two groups actually pose to Americans at home? Though roughly half the public, spun up by beheading videos and congressional declarations of impending doom, believes we are more at risk than at any other time since 9\/11, the dangers are more modest. The fact that the U.S. could gather the intelligence necessary to uncover the plot and carry out the strikes should provide some reassurance, even if a perfect defense is out of reach. And while it will be some time before the damage done by the air strikes is known, Khorasan and ISIS operatives are likely wondering what they&rsquo;ve gotten themselves into.<\/p>\n<p>Syria is going to remain a chaotic, dangerous safe haven for a long time to come, and Iraq will not be much better. Air strikes in both countries are just beginning. But after hundreds of billions of dollars spent on intelligence and homeland security, we are far from being the country we were on 9\/11. Knowing that is the first requirement of a successful strategy.<\/p>\n<p><i>Benjamin was the State Department&rsquo;s Coordinator for Counter-terrorism from 2009 to 2012 and directs Dartmouth&rsquo;s Dickey Center for International Understanding<\/i><\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3426970\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"Opinion","slug":"opinion","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/opinion\/","description":"Ideas.

While it may be exciting, is this the proper use for such a national treasure (in this case the park, not the jets)? You bet, according to the National Park Service, which oversees the 5,200 square-mile California park.<\/p>\n<p>While the FAA urges civilian aircraft to fly no lower than 2,000 feet&mdash;and orders them to stay above 500 feet&mdash;such altitude restrictions don&rsquo;t apply to military planes. That&rsquo;s because much of Death Valley is part of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.globalsecurity.org\/military\/facility\/r-2508.htm\" target=\"_blank\">R-2508 military training complex<\/a>. &ldquo;Congress and the FAA have given the military authority to deviate from standard flight regulations in the training complex,&rdquo; the park service <a href=\"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/regs-dv.png\" target=\"_blank\">says<\/a>. Outside of Death Valley itself&mdash;which includes many valleys&mdash;&ldquo;the military can fly to within 200 feet of the ground.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The military services regulate flights over national parks (<a href=\"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/regs-af.png\" target=\"_blank\">Air Force<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/regs-army.png\" target=\"_blank\">Army<\/a>), but those rules don&#8217;t always apply when the park is part of a military training range.<\/p>\n<p>Military pilots will tell you that flying low amid terrain&mdash;to practice hiding from enemy radar&mdash;can be good training for possible real-world missions. But such flights&mdash;especially outside military ranges&mdash;carry risks. In 1998, a Marine EA-6B jet crew was schussing, too fast and too low, through Italy&rsquo;s Dolomite Mountains. It clipped a ski gondola cable and sent it plummeting more than 300 feet to the ground, killing all 20 aboard. &ldquo;The aircraft,&rdquo; the official investigation <a href=\"http:\/\/www.defense.gov\/News\/NewsArticle.aspx?ID=41284\" target=\"_blank\">concluded<\/a>, &ldquo;flew lower and faster than authorized wherever the terrain permitted.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The pilot and navigator were cleared of charges of involuntary manslaughter and negligent homicide.

Kennedy<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In office 2.83 years<\/p>\n<p>1961-1963<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps one of the most well-known and beloved presidents, John F. Kennedy was assassinated by Lee Harvey Oswald in 1963. Oswald was arrested on the same day of the assassination, but he was shot and killed by a man named Jack Ruby two days later. While the FBI and the Warren Commission investigation concluded that Oswald had acted alone, the exact details of what happened are still a mystery, and many <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/news\/nation-now\/2013\/11\/21\/john-kennedy-conspiracy-theories-assasination\/3661891\/\">conspiracy theories<\/a> abound.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>6.<\/strong> <strong>Millard Fillmore<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In office 2.67 years<\/p>\n<p>1850-1853<\/p>\n<p>Millard Fillmore was the last Whig president, and took office after the death of President Taylor in 1850. Unlike the other vice presidents on this list who did not seek reelection, Fillmore threw his hat in the ring in 1852, but lost the Whig nomination to his secretary of state, Daniel Webster. He also ran on the American Party ticket in 1856, but came in third place.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>5. Warren G. Harding<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In office 2.42 years<\/p>\n<p>1921-1923<\/p>\n<p>Warren G. Harding campaigned on the promise of a &ldquo;return to normalcy&rdquo; after the First World War. He&rsquo;s most well-known for the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.britannica.com\/EBchecked\/topic\/585252\/Teapot-Dome-Scandal\">Teapot Dome Scandal<\/a>, but in recent years has been viewed more positively as a moderate politician who passed the first federal child welfare program and endorsed African-American civil rights. He intended to run for reelection in 1924, but passed away for unknown reasons in 1923. The most likely reason for his death is heart failure, but some have speculated that he was poisoned or committed suicide.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>4<\/strong>. <strong>Gerald Ford<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In office 2.42 years<\/p>\n<p>1974-1977<\/p>\n<p>Gerald Ford is the only person to rise to both the presidency and the vice presidency without being elected. He was appointed to the vice presidency when Spiro Agnew resigned in the face of extortion, bribery, and conspiracy charges, and was elevated to the presidency upon Nixon&rsquo;s resignation in 1974. Ford ran for reelection, defeating Reagan for the Republican nomination, but lost to Jimmy Carter in the presidential election.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>3.<\/strong> <strong>Zachary Taylor<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In office 1.33 years<\/p>\n<p>1849-1850<\/p>\n<p>Zachary Taylor rose to stardom when he led (and won) several battles in the Mexican-American War, helping America keep control over the annexed territory of Texas. Although he had little interest in politics, he was persuaded to leverage his popularity and run for the presidency in 1849. Taylor won the election, but died of a stomach related illness shortly into his term.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2.<\/strong> <strong>James A. Garfield<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In office .54 years<\/p>\n<p>1881-1881<\/p>\n<p>James A. Garfield was elected in 1881, but only served for a few months before he was shot by outraged political office seeker Charles J. Guiteau. Although Garfield was shot in June, he passed away (officially leaving office) 80 days later in September 1881. During his short time as president, Garfield appointed a justice to the U.S. Supreme Court and proposed a civil service reform act that was eventually passed into law by his successor, Chester A.

If Gov. Corbett took his full $187,256 salary, he&rsquo;d be the highest-paid governor in the nation. Instead, he&rsquo;s tied for second with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, and Virginia Gov.

Gov.

And while it&rsquo;s unclear what kind of wealth Gov. Bill Haslam has, his brother Jimmy Haslam&mdash;CEO of Pilot Flying J and owner of the NFL&rsquo;s Cleveland Browns&mdash;is worth about <a href=\"http:\/\/knoxblogs.com\/humphreyhill\/2013\/09\/16\/forbes-2013-richest-list-five-tn-two-brothers-named-bill\/\">$1.45 billion<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, the only governor to sacrifice his entire salary who does not fit the uber wealthy mold is Gov. Robert Bentley of Alabama. Bentley reported a high, but not extremely high, income of $372,687 in 2013, none of which came from his $119,950 governor&rsquo;s salary. $119,950 would be a noticeable contribution to his bottom line, but Gov. Bentley refuses to collect a dime until Alabama reaches a <a href=\"http:\/\/yellowhammernews.com\/statepolitics\/bentley-made-373k-last-year-0-governor\/\">full employment rate<\/a>, meaning the unemployment rate drops to 5.2 percent.<\/p>\n<p><em>FindTheBest is a research website that&rsquo;s collected all the data on <\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/governors.findthebest.com\/?utm_medium=editorial&amp;utm_source=time&amp;utm_campaign=kdhillon&amp;utm_content=footer&amp;utm_term=2R3AlrrNdAN\"><em>governors<\/em><\/a><em> and <\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/members-of-congress.findthebest.com\/?utm_medium=editorial&amp;utm_source=time&amp;utm_campaign=kdhillon&amp;utm_content=footer&amp;utm_term=2R3AlrrNdAN\"><em>Congress members<\/em><\/a><em>, and put it all in one place so you don&rsquo;t have to go searching for it. <\/em><em style=\"font-size:13px;line-height:19px;\">Join <\/em><a style=\"font-size:13px;line-height:19px;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.findthebest.com\/?utm_medium=editorial&amp;utm_source=time&amp;utm_campaign=kdhillon&amp;utm_content=footer&amp;utm_term=2R3AlrrNdAN\"><em>FindTheBest<\/em><\/a><em style=\"font-size:13px;line-height:19px;\"> to get all the information on governors, Congress members, and thousands of other topics.<\/em><\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3398917\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/politics\/","description":"Political insight from the Beltway and beyond.

And it&#8217;s timely, since the UN just announced a campaign called He for She, designed to get men involved in women&#8217;s rights.<\/p>\n","section":{"name":"Living","slug":"living","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/living\/","description":"The latest news and commentary from TIME on society, relationships, parenting, sex, psychology, aging, gender, career, women's issues, marriage, love and more"},"tag":{"name":"feminism","slug":"feminism","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tag\/feminism\/"},"tags":"feminism|Joseph Gordon-Levitt|women against feminism","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/joseph-gordon-levitt.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/joseph-gordon-levitt.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/joseph-gordon-levitt.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/joseph-gordon-levitt.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/joseph-gordon-levitt.jpg?w=1100"},"credit":"Ferdaus Shamim\u2014WireImage\/Getty Images","caption":"Joseph Gordon-Levitt  attends a screening of \"Don Jon\" during the 57th BFI London Film Festival at Odeon West End on October 16, 2013 in London.","alt":"Joseph Gordon-Levitt attends a screening of \"Don Jon\" during the 57th BFI London Film Festival at Odeon West End on October 16, 2013 in London."},"id":3426757,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3426757%2Fwatch-joseph-gordon-levitt-explain-why-hes-a-feminist-in-a-truly-thoughtful-way%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1uHnNlO","encoded_title":"Watch+Joseph+Gordon-Levitt+Explain+Why+He%E2%80%99s+a+Feminist+in+a+Truly+Thoughtful+Way","video":{"title":"Watch Joseph Gordon-Levitt Explain Why He&#8217;s a Feminist in a Truly Thoughtful Way","embed":"<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-pos=\"2\"><object id=\"bc-video-3803888351001-2\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#000000\"><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"1847503743001\"><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/ti.me\/1uHnNlO\"><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"TIME_onTemplateLoad\"><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"TIME_onTemplateReady\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"><param name=\"htmlFallback\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"3803888351001\"><\/object><\/div>","align":null},"twitter_text":"Watch%20Joseph%20Gordon-Levitt%20Explain%20Why%20He%27s%20a%20Feminist%20in%20a%20Truly%20Thoughtful%20Way","twitter_via":"TIME","ads":{"neg":"false","post_title":"Watch Joseph Gordon-Levitt Explain Why He's a Feminist in a Truly Thoughtful Way"},"Partner_Module":{"partner":"Select","post_title":"Watch Joseph Gordon-Levitt Explain Why He's a Feminist in a Truly Thoughtful Way"},"email_title":"Watch%20Joseph%20Gordon-Levitt%20Explain%20Why%20He%E2%80%99s%20a%20Feminist%20in%20a%20Truly%20Thoughtful%20Way%20%7C%20TIME","email_body":"Watch%20Joseph%20Gordon-Levitt%20Explain%20Why%20He%E2%80%99s%20a%20Feminist%20in%20a%20Truly%20Thoughtful%20Way%0A%0AAnyone%20who%20thinks%20men%20can%27t%20be%20feminists%20should%20watch%20this%20video%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3426757%2Fwatch-joseph-gordon-levitt-explain-why-hes-a-feminist-in-a-truly-thoughtful-way%2F","icon":"video"},{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/3426561\/apple-iphone-6-plus-ios-8-problems\/","shortlink":"http:\/\/ti.me\/1sqH8et","title":"Apple Has an iPhone Headache, But It Won&#8217;t Last Long","post_type":"post","time_article":true,"comments_allowed":true,"short_title":"Apple Has an iPhone Headache, But It Won&#8217;t Last Long","excerpt":"Apple's stock is down even though it just sold ten million iPhones in a weekend","format":"article","time":{"pretty":"4:51 PM ET","published":"2014-09-24 16:51:01","updated":"2014-09-24 20:51:01","minute":"4:51 pm","short":"4:51 PM ET"},"authors":[{"id":207072817,"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/author\/alex-fitzpatrick\/","name":"Alex Fitzpatrick","bio":"Alex Fitzpatrick is Homepage Director for Time.com, also covering technology, space and breaking news.

Then, early this week, reports flew around social media and tech blogs showing the iPhone 6 Plus, the big 5.5-inch granddaddy of the two iPhone 6 models, <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3422661\/iphone-6-plus-bend\/\" target=\"_blank\">was easy to bend<\/a> &mdash; some people claimed the phone bent when sitting in their pockets for extended periods, others bent the phones on purpose to prove it was possible, and everybody loved calling the whole thing &#8220;bendgazi.&#8221; Finally, Apple rolled out an <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3426075\/apple-ios-8-update-healthkit\/\" target=\"_blank\">iOS 8 update <\/a>Wednesday intended to fix that HealthKit problem and other minor issues, only to <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3426075\/apple-ios-8-update-healthkit\/\" target=\"_blank\">quickly pull it<\/a> after users complained the update had caused their iPhones to lose the ability to make phone calls.<br \/>\n<div class=\"galleryContainer galleryContainer--embedded\" data-gallery=\"3403734\" data-size=\"default\"><\/div><br \/>\n&#8220;We are actively investigating these reports and will provide information as quickly as we can,&rdquo; an Apple spokesperson told <a href=\"http:\/\/recode.net\/2014\/09\/24\/apple-pulls-back-ios-8-0-1-update-amid-reports-of-problems\/\" target=\"_blank\">several tech blogs<\/a> in a rare public statement about the iOS 8 update problems. &ldquo;In the meantime we have pulled back the iOS 8.0.1 update.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Apple did not respond to TIME&#8217;s request for more details. Apple has also been mum on the bending issue, although it&#8217;s a problem that&#8217;s affected bigger smartphones from other carriers, too, and there was <a href=\"http:\/\/thenextweb.com\/apple\/2014\/09\/24\/apple-support-says-bent-iphones-must-pass-visual-inspection-qualify-warranty-replacement\/\" target=\"_blank\">some indication<\/a> that Apple stores may replace bent iPhones on an individual basis. While Apple is typically tight-lipped about problems affecting its devices or software, there are signs it may be opening up: The confirmation about the iOS update problem is one example, but Apple also <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3271667\/apple-jennifer-lawrence-icloud-leak-security\/\" target=\"_blank\">recently directly addressed<\/a> an iCloud security flaw that led to the exposure of celebrities&#8217; nude photos. The minor moves toward transparency show an Apple that&#8217;s taking a different tack from years prior &mdash; back in 2010, late CEO Steve Jobs infamously made a non-apology apology for an iPhone 4 problem that prevented the device from making calls when it was held a certain way. While Apple acknowledged the issue and sent customers a special &#8220;bumper&#8221; case to fix it, Jobs still <a href=\"http:\/\/online.wsj.com\/articles\/SB10001424052748704913304575371131458273498\" target=\"_blank\">said<\/a> the problem had been &#8220;blown so out of proportion it&#8217;s incredible&#8221; &mdash; not the kind of language we&#8217;re hearing from the company lately.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s unclear as to how widespread the problems caused by that iOS update were. When I installed the update on an older iPhone 5C, it worked as advertised, so it&#8217;s possible the issues were limited to the new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. Still, Apple investors balked at the news, sending the company&#8217;s stock dipping nearly a percentage point by the closing bell. That&#8217;s a decent little dip for the world&#8217;s most cash-rich company, but there isn&#8217;t much reason to fret. Apple is still selling its new iPhones hand-over-fist, and it appears poised to sell its upcoming <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3313090\/apple-watch-hands-on\/\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Watch<\/a> hand-over-wrist in just a few months. The company may have a little headache now, but it&#8217;s got plenty of aspirin in the medicine cabinet.<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3426561\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"Business","slug":"business","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/business\/","description":"The latest news and commentary from TIME on domestic and global business, the economy, technology, personal finance, banking, marketing, management and more"},"topic":{"name":"iPhone 6","slug":"iphone-6","left_rail_title":"iPhone 6","left_rail_subhead":"iPhone 6","editor_content":"","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/topic\/iphone-6\/","email_title":"iPhone%206 | TIME","email_body":"iPhone%206%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2Ftopic%2Fiphone-6%2F","encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F%2F3227869%2Fgarry-kasparov-its-a-war-stupid%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2FWh1w2E","twitter_text":"","encoded_title":"iPhone%206"},"tag":{"name":"Companies","slug":"companies","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tag\/companies\/"},"tags":"Apple|Companies|iPhone","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/455687894.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/455687894.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/455687894.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/455687894.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/455687894.jpg?w=1100"},"credit":"Bloomberg&mdash;Bloomberg via Getty Images","caption":"An Apple Inc. iPhone 6 Plus, left, and iPhone 6 are displayed for a photograph inside SoftBank Corp.'s Omotesando store during the sales launch of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in Tokyo, Japan, on Friday, Sept. 19, 2014.","alt":"Apple Inc.'s iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus Go On Sale"},"id":3426561,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3426561%2Fapple-iphone-6-plus-ios-8-problems%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1sqH8et","encoded_title":"Apple+Has+an+iPhone+Headache%2C+But+It+Won%E2%80%99t+Last+Long","galleries":[{"id":3403734,"slug":"iphone-6-apple-release","title":"See the World Await and Celebrate Apple's iPhone 6","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/3403734\/iphone-6-apple-release\/","type":"normal","hidecount":false,"fullscreen":false,"counterfullscreen":true,"adfrequency":0,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3403734%2Fiphone-6-apple-release%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1Dnf52b","encoded_title":"See+the+World+Await+and+Celebrate+Apple%27s+iPhone+6","twitter_via":"TIMEBusiness","email_title":"See%20the%20World%20Await%20and%20Celebrate%20Apple%27s%20iPhone%206","hasAds":true,"twitter_text":"These%20Apple%20fans%20waited%20for%20days%20or%20weeks%20for%20the%20iPhone%206","fb_text":"These%20Apple%20fans%20waited%20for%20days%20or%20weeks%20for%20the%20iPhone%206","email_body":"It%20is%20a%20big%20day%20for%20Apple%20and%20iPhone%20enthusiasts.%20Many%20waited%20in%20line%20for%20days%20before%20doors%20opened%20on%20Friday%2C%20allowing%20them%20to%20buy%20the%20iPhone%206%20and%20iPhone%206%20Plus.","size":"default","galleries":[{"id":3418841,"title":"The 7 Most Important Tech CEOs You Wouldn't Recognize","image":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/455709574.jpg?w=550&h=367&crop=1","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/3418841\/important-tech-ceos-you-wouldnt-recognize\/"},{"id":3313291,"title":"Here's How to Explore the Pyramids From Your Own Home","image":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/google-streetview-egypt-great-sphinx-giza-pyramids.png?w=550&h=367&crop=1","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/3313291\/google-street-view-egypt-pyramids-sphinx\/"},{"id":3259694,"title":"The Rise of Mobile Phones from 1916 to Today","image":"http:\/\/i0.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/mobile-phones-history91.jpg?crop=0px%2C442px%2C1440px%2C961px&resize=550%2C367","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/3259694\/mobile-phone-history\/"},{"id":3206731,"title":"This Is What Europe's Largest 3D Scanner Looks Like","image":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/08\/3d-scanner1.jpg?w=550&h=367&crop=1","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/3206731\/3d-scanner\/"},{"id":3013603,"title":"These Vintage Computer Ads Show We've Come a Long, Long Way","image":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/07\/1997.jpg?w=550&h=367&crop=1","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/3013603\/vintage-computer-ads\/"},{"id":3080260,"title":"Why New Yorkers Are Getting Matched With Dogs on Tinder","image":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/08\/abandoned.jpg?w=550&h=367&crop=1","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/3080260\/new-york-tinder-dogs\/"}],"photos":[{"id":3403742,"title":"People pass time as they wait outside an Apple store for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus in London on Sept. 17, 2014.

It finds that less supportive parenting techniques used by some Chinese parents damages self-esteem and complicates school adjustment, while also putting kids at greater risk of depression and problem behaviors. &ldquo;Our research shows that Tiger Mother type of parenting, specifically controlling, punitive, and less supportive type of parenting is really not working in this sample of Chinese adolescents,&rdquo; said Cixin Wang, an assistant professor at UC Riverside&rsquo;s Graduate School of Education. &ldquo;It also shows that it is important for Chinese parents, who tend to be less emotionally expressive and use less praise in parenting, to show their approval, love and support for their children.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-mag\" data-name=\"rr-mag\"><div class=\"read-more-inline magazine has-cover\"><h6 class=\"read-more-list-h read-more-popular\">Popular Among Subscribers<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"popular-lead\"><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3397085\/the-tragic-risks-of-american-football\/?pcd=pw-pas\"><img src=\"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/football-cover1.jpg?w=560\" alt=\"Chad Stover Football Time Magazine Cover\" title=\"\" data-loaded=\"true\"><\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3397085\/the-tragic-risks-of-american-football\/?pcd=pw-pas\" class=\"read-more-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"read-more-inline-title time-icons time-icons-key\">The Tragic Risks of American Football<\/h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/subscription.time.com\/storefront\/subscribe-to-time\/link\/1019509.html\" class=\"subscribe-button\">Subscribe<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3397067\/u2s-mission-to-save-music\/?pcd=pw-pas\" class=\"read-more-article\" format-article><h3 class=\"read-more-inline-title time-icons time-icons-key\">U2\u2019s Mission to Save Music<\/h3><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3397062\/the-rise-of-concealed-weapons-in-america\/?pcd=pw-pas\" class=\"read-more-article\" format-article><h3 class=\"read-more-inline-title time-icons time-icons-key\">The Rise of Concealed Weapons in America<\/h3><\/a><\/div><\/aside><p>Chua&#8217;s book was packed with vivid, sometimes shocking tales of her strict approach to raising her own daughters, including limiting their social lives, shaming them as punishment when they failed, and forcing them to practice music until their performances were perfect. Ultimately, Chua&#8217;s daughters became very successful, and she insists that her hard-edged, unsentimental tactics are the key. Anyone who had ever marveled at the disproportionate academic success among Asian-American kids compared with other minorities now had an intriguing, rather disturbing, explanation: These kids&#8217; cold-hearted tiger moms were demanding perfect grades and mastery of musical instruments, and withholding praise and affection until their kids fell in line. It used to be called tough love until Chua gave it this cooler name.<\/p>\n<p>Giving a parenting style a cool name is not the same as proving its worth. In the wake of Chua&#8217;s sensational claims, <a href=\"http:\/\/news.stanford.edu\/news\/2014\/may\/asian-european-moms-052014.html\" target=\"_blank\">thoughtful research<\/a> has found that high-achieving Asian-American students have parental support and put in the necessary work &ndash; just as successful students from any culture must do. The flip side, of course, is that when high standards and a strong work ethic are accompanied by emotionally unsupportive parenting, Asian-American students are more likely to suffer negative effects &ndash; just as the children of cold or distant parents from any culture are. Furthermore, it turns out that Chua&#8217;s brand of harsh parenting is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.apa.org\/monitor\/2013\/09\/tiger-parenting.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">not even very common<\/a> among Chinese-American parents, who are more likely to be closely involved with their school-age children in a firm, encouraging, but overall positive way. Only when too much <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/88125\/the-tiger-mom-effect-is-real-says-large-study\/\" target=\"_blank\">pressure to perform<\/a> enters the picture do Asian-American kids suffer loss of self-esteem.<\/p>\n<p>None of this is new. Chua&#8217;s colorful account seemed to make everyone forget about <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jstor.org\/discover\/10.2307\/27541942?uid=3739832&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21104677893087\" target=\"_blank\">other research<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/eric.ed.gov\/?id=EJ490176\" target=\"_blank\">published years earlier,<\/a> which identified mundane and logical factors in Asian-American students&#8217; high-achieving ways. As long ago as 1988, large studies of minority students found that Asian-American students were more likely to come from stable, two-parent households, to spend more time &ldquo;on task,&rdquo; (meaning homework or music practice), and to have better study habits, greater access to after-school lessons and activities, and more parental involvement.<\/p>\n<p>Maybe our greatest chance for having successful kids is to leave behind the cultural stereotypes and focus on the best practices of all high-achieving households. Have high expectations, and communicate them clearly. Be aware of what your children are doing at school, and insist that they make their best effort on assignments and homework. Find opportunities for them to build on their curiosity in music classes, at the public library, at museums or on websites. You don&#8217;t have to pay for fancy lessons &ndash; whatever your family can afford can work. Of course, kids have different challenges and innate abilities. No one knows and loves your child the way you do, so you will know best whether he is working up to his potential. Make it clear that everyone in your family works hard at his or her job, and that is how you expect the kids to approach their studies, music lessons, sports, and other structured activities. You can set a very high bar and still come through with a hug and a word of encouragement when your child falls short of expectations&mdash;yours or his own. I have yet to see a research study that advises against this parenting style. If only I could come up with a cool name for it.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\"><\/div>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3426536\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"Living","slug":"living","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/living\/","description":"The latest news and commentary from TIME on society, relationships, parenting, sex, psychology, aging, gender, career, women's issues, marriage, love and more"},"tags":"Amy Chua|Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mom|Children|China|Parenting|Tiger mom","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/tiger-parenting1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/tiger-parenting1.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/tiger-parenting1.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/tiger-parenting1.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/tiger-parenting1.jpg?w=1100"},"credit":"David Jakle\u2014Getty Images\/","caption":"","alt":"183748801"},"id":3426536,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3426536%2Ftiger-mom-amy-chua-new-study%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1xhBHjh","encoded_title":"Tiger+Mom%2C+Hold+That+Growl","twitter_text":"Tiger%20mom%2C%20hold%20that%20growl","twitter_via":"TIME","ads":{"neg":"false","post_title":"Tiger Mom, Hold That Growl"},"Partner_Module":{"partner":"Select","post_title":"Tiger Mom, Hold That Growl"},"email_title":"Tiger%20Mom%2C%20Hold%20That%20Growl%20%7C%20TIME","email_body":"Tiger%20Mom%2C%20Hold%20That%20Growl%0A%0AA%20new%20study%20debunks%20the%20idea%20that%20punitive%2C%20Tiger%20Mom-style%20parenting%20is%20superior.%20%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3426536%2Ftiger-mom-amy-chua-new-study%2F","omniture":{"modules":"rr-taboola-video|rr-partner|rr-mag|rr-ad"}}]},"popularVideos":[3793424898001,3799282351001,3799170081001,3792378387001,3790898786001,3801232922001,3790907764001,3799170047001,3797679049001,3798652463001,3790040045001,3790264160001,3791386403001,3799646204001,3789861927001]}</script>	<script>
