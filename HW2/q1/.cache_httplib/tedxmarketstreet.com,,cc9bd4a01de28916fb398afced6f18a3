	<h2><strong>TED<sup>x</sup></strong>MarketStreet: <strong>Civic Innovation</strong></h2>
	<article>
			<p>There is a rising tension between the tech startup ecosystem and the pre-existing residents and social infrastructure of the city of San Francisco. At the geographical heart of these shifting tides is Market Street, a major thoroughfare that splits the city diagonally and houses old and new residents of the city. As we witness the creation of a continually changing, inimitably eccentric urban history, how can we make sure that technology and innovation are helping this transformation occur in a responsible way that benefits the entire community?</p>
			<p>At TEDxMarketStreet, we're spotlighting creative ways of tackling the income disparity in gentrifying cities by inviting a variety of voices to the stage in order to catalyze this important conversation.</p>
			<p>While we are hosting this event, we are fully aware that our stage alone cannot represent all the important voices in the community. We welcome all those who have an opinion on this matter to join and help steer the conversation here. We also have a few speaker slots left, so please feel free to suggest other powerful voices whose views are not yet represented on this speaker roster. </p>
			<p>We welcome all those who have an opinion on this matter to join and help steer the conversation via our <a href="discuss.html">discussion page</a>.</p>
