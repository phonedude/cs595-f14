<h1 class="posttitle">DOJ Says Company That Vetted Snowden Faked 665,000 Background Checks</h1><h3>from the <i>well-of-course</i> dept</h3><div class="postbody">
When we last checked in on USIS, the contracting firm which large parts of the federal government and the intelligence community used to conduct background checks on employees (including Ed Snowden), we noted that it had been caught <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130709/11374023748/contractors-providing-background-checks-nsa-caught-falsifying-reports-interviewing-dead.shtml">falsifying reports and claiming to have interviewed dead people</a>. At the time, we noted at least one USIS employee had been accused of submitting 1,600 falsified credit reports. But, apparently, the story goes much, much deeper. The DOJ is now accusing USIS of <a href="http://investigations.nbcnews.com/_news/2014/01/23/22401812-doj-accuses-firm-that-vetted-snowden-of-faking-665000-background-checks#.UuLBsYpJl1M.twitter" target="_blank">faking background checks on 665,000 federal employees</a>.
<br/><br/>
Not only that, but the practice of scamming the government seems to have been the official policy of the organization, clearly described in various emails. Basically, USIS was paid based on each completed background check, and realized it was a lot more profitable to "complete" them by not doing most of the actual work (pricey!) and just take the money (profits!).
<blockquote><i>
Beginning in at least March 2008 and continuing through at least September
2012, USIS management devised and executed a scheme to deliberately circumvent contractually
required quality reviews of completed background investigations in order to increase the
company&#8217;s revenues and profits. Specifically, USIS devised a practice referred to internally as
&#8220;dumping&#8221; or &#8220;flushing,&#8221; which involved releasing cases to OPM and representing them as complete when, in fact, not all ROIs comprising
those cases had received
a quality review as
required by the Fieldwork Contracts.
<br/><br/>
USIS engaged in the practice of dumping in order to meet budgeted goals and,
therefore, increase its revenues and profits. Given that USIS was paid by OPM for each
completed case, the more cases USIS completed each month the more money it received from
OPM. USIS&#8217;s dumping practices also enabled the company to receive annual performance
incentive payments that it would not
otherwise have been entitled to
receive absent the dumping
</i></blockquote>
Oh, and it became so profitable, they set up a computer program to help them defraud the government and not complete background checks. No joke.
<blockquote><i>
Initially, USIS would dump cases manually. Soon after the dumping started,
however, USIS began using a software program
called Blue Zone to assist in the dumping
practices. Through Blue Zone, USIS was able
to identify a large number of background
investigations, quickly make an electronic &#8220;Review Complete&#8221; notation indicating that the ROIs
at issue had gone through the review process even if they had not, and then automatically release
all of those ROIs to OPM with the &#8220;Review Complete&#8221; notation attached. By using Blue Zone,
USIS was able to substantially
increase the number of background investigations that could be
dumped in a short time period.
</i></blockquote>
You have to hand it to them. Not only did they figure out how to scam the government, they sure as hell did it efficiently. That's the American spirit at work!
<br/><br/>
In fact, it appears this became a key part of how USIS worked. Originally, it would only "dump" unfinished cases at the end of each day if it was behind schedule. But, later it realized it could get paid more by dumping these cases repeatedly during the day. No need to build up a queue, just dump... and get paid.
<br/><br/>
The DOJ also has emails showing that senior management was well aware this was going on and even participated or encouraged the activity.
<blockquote><i>
Internal USIS documents confirm that
USIS Senior Management was aware of
and directed the dumping practices. For example, in one undated internal document, a USIS
employee discussing the dumping
practices stated: &#8220;They will dump cases when word comes
from above, such as from [the President of
Investigative Service Division] and [the
President/CEO]. In the past, [the President
of Investigative Service Division] and [the
President/CEO] have told us to clear out our shelves in order to hit revenue. When this is done
they will dump all [priority code] 6. If [the President of Investigative Service Division] and [the
President/CEO] tell them they need to clear out more then they will dump [priority code] 5&#8217;s....
Last July through September we were dumping all
[priority code] 4, 5, and
6&#8217;s per [the President
of Investigative Service Division] and [the President/CEO].&#8221;
<br/><br/>
Another email chain dated September 16 and 17, 2010 involving USIS&#8217;s Vice President of Field Operations and its President of Investigative Service Division, among others, discussed the need to dump cases to meet revenue goals. The Vice President of Field
Operations referenced USIS&#8217;s revenue situation as &#8220;[w]e all own this baby, and right now we are holding one ugly baby.&#8221; The USIS Workload Leader in Western Pennsylvania forwarded that
email to the Director of National Quality Assurance and the Quality Control Manager in Western Pennsylvania and responded: &#8220;The only two things we can do in review to get them out faster is to (a) hire or (b) dump.... I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s any other levers left to flip other than dumping everything we know is bad. Just a side note, the more MSPC [Master Scheduling Production Control] rams through, the more the field will transmit sub-standards, and the more [the number of cases needing secondary review] will go up. Come EOM [End of Month], if they&#8217;re going to tell us to just dump all those cases anyways without a proper review, which [sic] will only make
that ugly baby even uglier...&#8221;
</i></blockquote>
There's also an email in which a "Workload Leader" tells the top "quality" assurance execs:
<blockquote><i>
"Shelves are as clean as they could get. Flushed everything like a dead goldfish."
</i></blockquote>
Oh, and another:
<blockquote><i>
"t'is Flushy McFlushershon at his merry hijinks again!! **leprechaun dance**...I'm not tired..."
</i></blockquote>
So, remember, folks, when Senator Dianne Feinstein insists the NSA would never abuse your privacy because they're <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140120/16213125934/dianne-feinstein-nsa-would-never-abuse-its-powers-because-its-professional.shtml">professional</a>, just realize that many of those "professionals" might not have actually gone through a background check, because it was taking away profits from a private contractor to actually do its job.<center>

<div class="cbody">Not to purposefully make this political but...<br/><br/><br/>isn't stuff like this exactly what Libertarians say WOULDN'T happen in a pure and free economy?<br/>If we didn't have any centralized group controlling things, problems like this would be even more wide spread with maybe little chance of catching them.<br/>People are greedy assholes who will suck at the overly large teet of the government. Because they can get away with it.<br/>I still stand by the statement that the inherent size of "our" government isn't inherently the problem. The problem comes from the complete lack of accountability at basically every level.<br/>Act like this is a big news story(which is very well should be) but in a week this will be replaced with Biber getting prole, the next Zimmerman, or the Super Bowl.

<h3 class="commentsubject">Re:</h3><div class="cbody">And why wouldn't it happen in a free economy? I don't see any hindrance there, except of course, that the government decided to outsource something it shouldn't have in the first place, and which it could only outsource because the lax privacy laws allowed it. <br/> <br/> If private data about citizens is kept private, a company can't just "do background checks", because it won't get any. So the government has to do it itself. Which it should do anyway, because this is about clearances to secrets. <br/> <br/> Which brings me to another point: classifying is completely broken. If you need 2 million people with "secret" clearances (and those people need them, lest they can't do their jobs), there is something seriously wrong with what _the people_ allow the government to "classify".<br/><br/>Overclassification is the enemy. The solution is to be transparent, and if you're embarrassed about blatantly fostering the agenda of the MPAA via your consulates, then don't friggin do it!</div><p class="cmt_ops" style="float:right;text-align:right;">&nbsp;</p><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20140124/12433225982/doj-says-company-that-vetted-snowden-faked-665000-background-checks.shtml?cid=220#addyourcomment" cid="220" subject="Re:" cid="220" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_220" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20140124/12433225982/doj-says-company-that-vetted-snowden-faked-665000-background-checks.shtml#c220">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20140124/12433225982/doj-says-company-that-vetted-snowden-faked-665000-background-checks.shtml?threaded=true#c220">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

<h3 class="commentsubject">Re: Re: Hehe</h3><div class="cbody"><i> I was thinking something along those same lines. How exactly did they get the "internal USIS documents"?</i><br/><br/>I suspect, based on my very limited experience here, the DoJ discovered a bunch of questionable background investigations and decided to subpoena the company for any internal documents relating to the process of performing background checks. The company, instead of pulling a Enron (shredding the documents,) decided it was in their best interest to come clean and cooperate (especially, since, they say that all of the employees involved have been fired or no longer work for the company.) It is entirely possible that someone within the company blew the whistle, but not necessarily so (the article doesn't say whether the whistle was blown or whether it was a result of a subpoena.)<br/><br/><i>So taking internal documents that show impropriety from an entity and then releasing them to expose that impropriety is okay when the entity is someone else but when someone takes their documents to prove their impropriety, then they get pissed and want him murdered for it.</i><br/><br/>I see where you are coming from, but at least in this place it can be that they didn't actually release them, but they were attached to a subpoena which is public records as part of a court case. The civil lawsuit was already filed against the USIS by the DoJ in Alabama, and except in certain cases, most lawsuits and their associated documentation are available to the public.</div><p class="cmt_ops" style="float:right;text-align:right;">&nbsp;</p><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20140124/12433225982/doj-says-company-that-vetted-snowden-faked-665000-background-checks.shtml?cid=352#addyourcomment" cid="352" subject="Re: Re: Hehe" cid="352" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_352" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20140124/12433225982/doj-says-company-that-vetted-snowden-faked-665000-background-checks.shtml#c352">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20140124/12433225982/doj-says-company-that-vetted-snowden-faked-665000-background-checks.shtml?threaded=true#c352">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

Over-simplification. What if the NSA had exactly 2 buckets (announcements Vs secrets) and only 2 employees are doing all the classifying -- now, do you care that you still don't get to know the size of the bucket labelled Secrets, nor how those 2 folks do their secretive job? Do you care whether or not your government gets to peer at the secrets "sometimes" (we wont say exactly when) without first obtaining a warrant? Do you care that some secrets are classified as forever-secrets? Whether we can or cant announce examples of how "secret keeping" has safe lives?<br/><br/>When we blend public-surveillance with targeted-surveillance, then the deep-dark secrets become less concerning than the deeper-darker secrecy surrounding the the necessary gagging and self-serving psychology of employees within NSA, FBI, other US government departments (and their "partners" like USIS) etc etc etc.</div><p class="cmt_ops" style="float:right;text-align:right;">&nbsp;</p><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20140124/12433225982/doj-says-company-that-vetted-snowden-faked-665000-background-checks.shtml?cid=591#addyourcomment" cid="591" subject="Re: Re:" cid="591" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_591" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20140124/12433225982/doj-says-company-that-vetted-snowden-faked-665000-background-checks.shtml#c591">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20140124/12433225982/doj-says-company-that-vetted-snowden-faked-665000-background-checks.shtml?threaded=true#c591">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

<h3 class="commentsubject">Re:</h3><div class="cbody">Thank you, Geno0wl. This is why I often get into arguments with them. In the purest, biggest-L sense, they are basically anti-communist. Since they are doing the polar opposite of communism without actually thinking it through, they make the same intellectual failures as any ideologue makes, which is to assume that everyone on their team, if they stick to "the plan," can't go wrong. <br/> <br/> This means that evidence of ideological purity is conflated with moral purity followed by frantic denial and squeals of indignation when human nature makes itself clear, i.e. if a situation can be abused, it will be.<br/><br/>For this reason I am skeptical that any one ideology can, by itself, when "properly" put into practice, save us. Life just doesn't work that way.</div><p class="cmt_ops" style="float:right;text-align:right;">&nbsp;</p><p class="cmt_ops">[&nbsp;<a class="cmtrp" href="/articles/20140124/12433225982/doj-says-company-that-vetted-snowden-faked-665000-background-checks.shtml?cid=653#addyourcomment" cid="653" subject="Re:" cid="653" title="Reply to this comment..." id="cmmt_link_653" rel="nofollow">reply to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20140124/12433225982/doj-says-company-that-vetted-snowden-faked-665000-background-checks.shtml#c653">link to this</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="/articles/20140124/12433225982/doj-says-company-that-vetted-snowden-faked-665000-background-checks.shtml?threaded=true#c653">view in thread</a>&nbsp;]

Of course those companies are going to put profit before anything else. It is their entire reason for existing.<br/><br/>Sure government is bureaucratic and slow, but for some things, like background checks and security clearances, that is exactly what you want.
