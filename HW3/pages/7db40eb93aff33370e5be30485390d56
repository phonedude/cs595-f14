    <p>
	Yesterday, there was a wall of Tesla patents in the lobby of our Palo Alto headquarters. That is no longer the case. They have been removed, in the spirit of the open source movement, for the advancement of electric vehicle technology.</p>
<p>
	Tesla Motors was created to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport. If we clear a path to the creation of compelling electric vehicles, but then lay intellectual property landmines behind us to inhibit others, we are acting in a manner contrary to that goal. Tesla will not initiate patent lawsuits against anyone who, in good faith, wants to use our technology.</p>
<p>
	When I started out with my first company, Zip2, I thought patents were a good thing and worked hard to obtain them. And maybe they were good long ago, but too often these days they serve merely to stifle progress, entrench the positions of giant corporations and enrich those in the legal profession, rather than the actual inventors. After Zip2, when I realized that receiving a patent really just meant that you bought a lottery ticket to a lawsuit, I avoided them whenever possible.</p>
<p>
	At Tesla, however, we felt compelled to create patents out of concern that the big car companies would copy our technology and then use their massive manufacturing, sales and marketing power to overwhelm Tesla. We couldn&rsquo;t have been more wrong. The unfortunate reality is the opposite: electric car programs (or programs for any vehicle that doesn&rsquo;t burn hydrocarbons) at the major manufacturers are small to non-existent, constituting an average of far less than 1% of their total vehicle sales.</p>
<p>
	At best, the large automakers are producing electric cars with limited range in limited volume. Some produce no zero emission cars at all.</p>
<p>
	Given that annual new vehicle production is approaching 100 million per year and the global fleet is approximately 2 billion cars, it is impossible for Tesla to build electric cars fast enough to address the carbon crisis. By the same token, it means the market is enormous. Our true competition is not the small trickle of non-Tesla electric cars being produced, but rather the enormous flood of gasoline cars pouring out of the world&rsquo;s factories every day.</p>
<p>
	We believe that Tesla, other companies making electric cars, and the world would all benefit from a common, rapidly-evolving technology platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Technology leadership is not defined by patents, which history has repeatedly shown to be small protection indeed against a determined competitor, but rather by the ability of a company to attract and motivate the world&rsquo;s most talented engineers. We believe that applying the open source philosophy to our patents will strengthen rather than diminish Tesla&rsquo;s position in this regard.</p></div>

    <p><p>I don't understand the headline, but I understand the spirit. A more robust EV segment can only help everyone with skin in the game. This is a rare situation where rivals can do much better if they share technology and take advantage of shared experience and buying power. But this begs a big question: If Tesla is supply-constrained right down to the batteries, and needs a massive new factory just to keep its head afloat, how could any rival leapfrog Tesla even if it has the "blueprints" to do so? Where would it get the goods? I don't see any significant change to the automotive landscape coming anytime soon, patents or no patents. But I do see yet another PR boost for Tesla here.</p></p>

<p>A lot of people will disagree.  I don't care.</p>
<p>Thank you, Elon!  I was hoping very much that you had noticed that the other auto manufacturers have no intent whatsoever to create viable electric cars.  Everything they do is meant to perpetuate the myth that petroleum products will last forever.</p>
<p>By opening up the patents, anyone else who has the inkling to build from the ground up as a supplier of EVs can do so without having to reinvent the wheel.  By empowering others to follow the same path as you have, the traditional ICE industry may be accosted from multiple sides.  </p>
<p>Further, those companies who have only dabbled in low volume hybrid electric supercars may now decide to investigate the possibility of making fully electric versions instead.</p>

    <p><p>This is beyond outstanding!  Well done Tesla!  This won't make as big a splash in the media as it deserves to and few people will understand how important this decision is.  This is so opposite the offensive patent strategy executed by companies like Apple and I dare say Tesla holds far more useful and world changing proprietary tech.</p></p>

    <p><p>The spirit is highly commendable, and as habitants of this planet - and coincidental timing with @neiltyson #Cosmos finale - we all should be seriously concerned about emissions. When someone as intelligent as Elon Musk &amp; Neil deGrasse Tyson say stuff like "we need to pay attention to this stuff", the world needs to pay attention.</p>
<p>The attorneys probably gasped out loud when their CEO said "we're doing this", and shareholders are probably biting their lips, but the guy is stating repeatedly getting to Mars is key for species survival...it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out the urgency and importance to getting away from fossil fuel vehicles ASAP.</p>
<p>The gesture and implication for not enforcing held patents to better encourage innovation and R&amp;D, should earn Elon Musk not Man of the Year, but Man of the Century consideration. Or maybe Earth's MVP award equivalent. Seriously.</p></p>

    <p><p>I've said it before and I'll say it again - Elon Musk is my hero, perhaps the most selfless billionaire in a world where too many are concerned exclusively with their own greedy self interests.</p>
<p>Does this open Tesla to some risks they didn't already face?  Perhaps.  But having the right to build something, and having the ability to execute, are two different things.  My faith remains with Elon and the exceptional team he has assembled.</p>
<p>The competition may win my business someday, but what a world it will be when others can build a car better than my Model S.</p></p>

    <p><p>Great! You're so far ahead of their engineers' sort of thinking that you can keep your advantages for quite some time. To that end, isn't it time to redesign the Model S and provide some new cars on the same template (though not precisely the same look)? For example, a 4 seater luxury coupe, a 2+2 seater sports car (a la Aston Martin just plonked on the Model S base with 400bhp motor), a 2 seater sports car, an XC90-esque rear wheel drive station wagon, all with the same motor and battery and everything else, just changed bodywork. If you had a proper cooling solution to the motor you can probably get 500-600bhp out of it reliably (at least in short bursts). </p>

<p>We will wait for the Chinese to copy the car soon.<br />
Maybe. And they do NOT need the same gross margin (and Chinese import tariff) since they are not concerned with development of the next generation or model E. I do not agree with Elon this time! He must to what is in the shareholders interest as a CEO. He could easily have made money to development by selling or licensing their tech very cheap. This may be the first time I disagree with him. Too bad !!</p></p>

    <p><p>This is fantastic, if nothing else than for spite! During the Great White Flight post WW2 GM and other major manufacturers bought mass transit patents to force people into buying cars when not needed. Your making them free for anyone will be a huge and necessary blow to their antiquated industry where they stifle competition.</p>
<p>I used to be a car salesman, did it for four years but I was always cynical in their approach. It seems like now they've met their match in terms of ingenuity. In the 70s when Honda and Toyota were breaking into the market they lobbied for import taxes and produced a shitty product because they could. Good luck now, "Big 3"</p></p>

    <p><p>Wow!!</p>
<p>Patents are more or less worthless now anyway.  When Apple can get a design patent for a rounder rectangle it kind of kills any credibility that might be left in the system.</p>
<p>I think this is the right move for Tesla as there is no temptation to waste resources to defend patents....</p>
<p>Just build the best cars you can and let the others feed the lawyers....</p></p>

    <p><p>This is excellent , I really appreciate Elon.</p>
<p>Perhaps Apple Inc could follow suit, so everyone can benefit from technology rather than apple trying to make ton of money and keep fighting these parent wars on smartphones ?</p>
<p>On a different note , Elon , are you considering new battery technology like power japan plus dual carbon batteries to power your future electric cars ?</p></p>

    <p><p>Tesla will continue to draw top talent, out innovate, and make great products. That's what matters, not patents. But I have to wonder, how could this move be abused? Could another car maker (start-up or big player) reverse engineer the Tesla charging port and have their cars start using the supercharger network for free?</p>
<p>If Tesla wants to stop them, now they can't use patents to do it. This rogue 3rd party could just claim "in good faith we want to use Tesla technology to advance EVs". Maybe Tesla would not want to stop them, but then would Tesla keep building supercharger locations if they were being used be non-Tesla cars? And how would Tesla drivers feel if they had to wait in line to get access. </p>
<p>This has to be considered on a worldwide scale, would it happen in China, US, UK...? Arguably, in some markets, patents wouldn't help them protect against this much anyway. Something to consider.</p></p>

    <p><p>This is absolutely great! Keep up the fantastic work! I just wanted to leave a comment to show that although I don't own a TESLA (yet) I still pay attention to great work this company is doing. </p>
<p>I hope every employee there knows what an awesome job they're doing by revolutionizing the automotive industry, not giving into UAW pressure, and taking on the unfair selling practices that dealers have created.</p>
<p>I believe TESLA will go down in history for all its done, and when our children's children look back at this time for innovation the word TESLA will not only be in their science books but also in their history books as well.</p></p>

    <p><p>This is eerie, but reflective of the synchronicity that is flooding the minds of the masses of people. </p>
<p>As I was driving yesterday, I thought to myself "If I'm ever fortunate enough to purchase a Tesla, I do my best to promote its engineering feats to whomever I encounter. I would also do whatever I could to encourage Mr. Musk to consider release the patents to world. He is doing wonderful work but needs help to achieve his and the honorable Nikola Tesla's vision." </p>
<p>I shouldn't be surprised that EM and Tesla Motors are right on par with the ultimate vision of Mr. Tesla. I used to work at an oil company and I've seen how much money changes hands from these tycoons on a daily basis - so I'm sure you know you're in for a war. You have a soldier in me waiting for a fight.</p></p>

In today's world this is almost un-heard of and this is why If I had the money to support your ideas and hard work put forth into the Tesla I'd sell my current car in a heartbeat and buy one of yours.. but not because it's new and "Fancy" but for the fact that the way this company is ran from the outside looking in is flawless. Thank you Tesla for everything I really hope this creates a spark in today's everyday life and way of business. Please continue to bring the future!</p>

    <p><p>My designs for electric flying motorcycles and e-flying bicycles are in the public domain, but need help and support in bringing them to market. The first 10,000 feet of air space is the most under utilized natural resource on the planet. Multi-modal electric personal air vehicles (e-PAVs) are technically plausible today. Transferring 10 to 30 percent of the surface traffic volume into a computer based and controlled airspace will go a long way in relieving traffic congestion and carbon dependency, and achieving the safest possible transport environment. Some designs are not on the web site <a href="http://www.flyingmotorcyclecompany.com" title="www.flyingmotorcyclecompany.com">www.flyingmotorcyclecompany.com</a>. I reaching out to you Elon.</p></p>

    <p><p>Seems like a cool move.  But I am confused by the motivation of the whole movement towards open source in this case.  What's said makes sense.  But why buy a TSLA in the future when there are others available?  How does this impact the future business model and profitability of TSLA?  Perhaps other auto makers are not able to enter into the electric market due to lack of R&amp;D funding the resources or simply operationally constricted to do anything beyond what they are currently doing - tweaking things here and there and call it a "new model."  If that's the case, then open source may not promote the wide adoption that's hoped.  As an investor, I wonder if at all this would impact TSLA stock pricing.</p></p>

This is good news :) smart move. now, all we have to do is discover-invent a device that converts universal energy into electricity or some very good batteries :) and we are closer to freedom. I would like so very much to work for Tesla Motors. All i would want is water, food and a place to sleep :)</p></p>

    <p><p>I'm not going to be able to apply this public domain information to better our world in the way that Tesla is doing by producing carbon-free cars, but I will do what I can to expand the spirit of this magnanimous gesture.</p>
<p>One thing is clear, Elon: You are out-competing the traditional OEM industry by competing at a much higher level in product, marketing, and strategic philosophy. Most people are behind you 100%, and can't wait to jump the Hydrocarbon/franchised dealer/excess production prison ship.</p>
<p>Let's get that Model X on the road so that normal people like me can make a real contribution.</p>

<p>What a wonderful way to demonstrate that Tesla is about the survival of our planet.  The fact that the announcement was made today, the date that would have been my wonderful parents' 55th wedding anniversary, is quite beautiful.  My father was the best human being on earth.  He would be so proud that his daughter is such a strong supporter of such a good, decent, caring company.  As much as I love the Model S, I love the true purpose of Tesla even more.  Stay strong Mr. Musk.  We need you. Thank goodness you chose to come to America.  You make people proud to be a part of Tesla, no matter how small that part may be.  Tesla is the best company in history.  It is by far the best car built in history.  Just ask any Tesla owner.  Never take my Model S away. It would not be pretty.  Thank you again sir.  You continue to take our breath away.</p></p>

    <p><p>After having left the Marine Corps, about 30 year ago, I saw the movie, "The Shoes of the Fisherman"  the first time. In the Corps I'd been in numerous foreign countries and I'd witnessed the effects that a lack of: food, fuel, shelter, pollution and other things have on people. The gesture Anthony Quinn-playing the Pope,selling assets of the Church in order to feed needy people, though fictitious  cause me to well up with emotion and tears. This move is conceptually similar to what you have done with Tesla's patents-good job Mr. Musk! I am proud to own the stock and one day hope to own a car.  However, I am long on the world and being able to breathe clean air seems like a good idea to me.</p></p>

    <p><p>What your trying Elon won't work.  We both know your designs are ancient and way out of date.  Your not going to flush out those of us that know and then take a better design and make even more cash or suppress the technology for your Saudi lithium lords .  Do us a favor and keep your patents and money. Your only helping the Saudi's who have invested greatly in lithium sourcing and the high capacity battery market.  No, we the silent ones who hide from the corporate energy monsters will not help you.  We will wait silently for humanity to pull it's head out of its back side.  Probably won't happen in our life time.  FYI don't try.  The good one's of us don't keep our designs on our hard drive amigo.  Batteries!?  Ha, so early 1900s.  Let us remember what happened to Nikola Tesla when he wanted free energy for all.  Poor ol guy.  Never even saw it coming.  Died old and penny less thanks to the corporations greed.</p></p>

    <p><p>I love the idea of opening up the technology for other companies to make use of in their own products and services. Throughout history there have been knowledge and/or technology graciously given to mankind, that caused an explosion of industry and innovation. Time will only tell if this is one of those events.</p>
<p>I like the idea of non-motor companies making use of this technology, like companies that are in the business of only making charging stations. From what I have read the charging station adapters range from continent to continent, making the adoption of electric cars harder. An open standard for this would be beneficial to all.</p>
<p>Will (or is it already) this information be readily available for all to read and discover in a centre place? like <a href="http://open.teslamotors.com" title="http://open.teslamotors.com">http://open.teslamotors.com</a> or something to that effect?</p>
<p>Thanks for helping make the world a better, cleaner place.</p></p>

    <p><p>karlasing@gmail.com: Solar, water, wind, yes- coal; a variety of methods. He merely solved a link in the chain of problems. Which is a massive and impactful step. Also, GM and the car co.'s benefited even MORE from government subsidizing, that were much, much larger. Nice try.</p>

    <p><p>"I realized that receiving a patent really just meant that you bought a lottery ticket to a lawsuit..." I love how you so concisely speak the truth in this case. Does "opening" your patents mean that you will be licensing the rights to them, more or less routinely, as long as the licensees operate in good faith? Although there has been an indecent amount of patent trolling over the past several decades, Silicon Valley long ago figured out that liberal licensing and cross-licensing of patents could keep innovation flowing vigorously, while preventing the kind of abuse you were worried the big automakers would practice against Tesla.</p>
<p>Or is it that you won't even bother with the formality of licensing the use of your patents, basically putting the intellectual property into the public domain? Is there anywhere I can find the details of the arrangement you propose?</p>
<p>I hope your new direction works out well, and is not the first step toward shutting down Tesla as a car maker in its own right (by planting seeds for a thousand flowers to bloom in replacement). I have been a Tesla fan since the many years, during which the Roadster was accused of being vaporware. I knew Tesla would make it happen, and I look forward with patience and enthusiasm to the affordable model, to arrive someday soon. If I can afford a Model-S before then, so much the better! I think the world needs Tesla, to show the way and set a high standard. Thanks for everything so far, and best of luck in all future endeavors.</p></p>

It is far superior to the J1772, CHAdeMO and the SAE Frankenplug and could replace all three on future EVs and chargers.

    <p><p>@ don@tapscott Maybe you sent your Magnum Opel to the wrong Lotus? </p>
<p>IIRC, Tesla Roadster is based on Lotus Esprit chassis, not Elan. </p>
<p>Mr Musk is of a completely different fragrance. </p>

    <p><p>This is all well and good... but until we get truly cheap power as Nikola himself envisioned - by tapping into the Ionosphere (that's what his towers were really for) - until then, this is all a moot point.. generating power at the moment comes at great expense, mostly into the pockets of bankers.. this must change first.. the rest will follow..  basically free power would change the world in ways you can only imagine...  its more than just a free car ride.. clean air, clean water, and most of all true independence from the shackles that hold us all down now...</p></p>

    <p><p>Great news from Tesla indeed, for different reasons though. I congratulate Mr. Musk for being a visionary who understands the need of a future replacement of petrol based car industry. By releasing patents to the public Tesla helps others to enter EV car market or boost their existing projects thus creating bigger and stronger e-car market. This combined with the growing network of charging stations along with the planned 5-billion US $ battery plant project will give Tesla substantial advantage. Electricity storage continues to be the biggest challenge to overcome in e-cars and whoever rules the battery market innovations and their mass volume production will hugely benefit from the EV boom in the future. Moreover, I think this may be the beginning, which will lead to the transformation of Tesla from a miniscule car manufacturer into a global player in the car battery market and charging stations services. Good luck.</p></p>

    <p><p>To those making excuses re: the title of this blog:</p>
<p>Not everyone who wants/does own a Tesla vehicle is up on old sci-fi references.  </p>
<p>For the CEO of a huge company to make a reference like that and just assume we would all know what he was talking about was a bad choice.  My first reaction was not, "haha, that's funny."  It was, rather, "doesn't the CEO of a multi-million dollar corporation have someone to proofread his blog? </p>
<p>I get it now; haha.  You could have made it the subtitle, put it in quotes, or even directly referenced it.  Instead, you lost me as a fan.</p>
<p>Sorry.  </p>
<p>But, your intentions with this move are wonderful, and I like the idea.  I just hope it doesn't cause more delays due to the competition coming up with more ways to undercut you.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p></p>

    <p><p>You are a seriously awesome bunch of geeks! I've been anxiously following your progress since the start, and I'm so happy things are going well. This announcement totally wins the universe and I hope many good things come as a result, for everyone. I'll be dreaming of the day I can afford a Tesla.<br />

Much love!!</p></p>

    <p><p>Can someone please voice their thoughts on how they think this will affect the success of Tesla as a company?  There is no doubt that this move is good for the world, but what about Tesla and its shareholders?  I went all in for TSLA and there are many others that have as well.  And as much as I admire Elon for his love for the planet, this move seems a bit kamikaze.  Just like those Japanese pilots that dove head-first into an enemy base in order to win a war for a cause.  Tesla is essentially giving out whatever advantage it has over its competitors, most of whom have more money and clout than Tesla.  Elon's response on this seems to be that the consumer market for cars is large enough which makes him to seem content with a smaller piece of the pie.  That is all admirable.  But what about TSLA's shareholders??!!  Am I the only one having these thoughts and concerns??  We are the ones who invested our money and it seems we are the least regarded in this decision.</p>
<p>This is not a hate message.  In fact, I admire Elon so much that I have watched almost every youtube video there is on him.  There is nothing to dislike about the guy.  But I wish I can gain his thoughts on how this will affect TSLA stockholders.</p></p>

    <p><p>Well that's indeed a great new stance analogous to hybrid patent programming. However, while not referring to the literal connotation to the following statement of Elon "...lay intellectual property landmines behind us to inhibit others...", but to the symbolic connotation therefor landmines in certain real-time scenarios may serve as great food for thought to as a matter of fact detect, analyze and carefully select white spaces/gaps in existing systems or solutions to detect likelihood of design and implementation of at least one of new and enhanced systems or solutions...which is in conformance to your statement "...in good faith..." Eventually, on a lighter note, I see Tesla having filed and/or granted approx. 500 patent apps/patents in a span of 4 yrs 2009 till date. Hats off to thee!!</p></p>

    <p><p>I am the CEO of a Blackburn Energy, a Cambridge Mass design and engineering start-up that created an electrification system for long haul trucks that eliminates fuel used during overnight idle time. We save 21 tons of CO2 per truck and there are 500,000 trucks in the category.  (thats 10M + tons of CO2 per year!) Tesla's decision is an extraordinary step towards unleashing innovation in this space.  Great job Telsal!!  </p>

    <p><p>This is inspiring news. Thank you, Elon.</p>
<p>What's unfortunate is the lack of leadership coming from the rest of the industry. If we are to transition to a more sustainable future, we're going to need a vision or "pull" like Tesla is offering but I also think we're going to need a "push". The auto-sector isn't evolving because the market is mostly complacent. We're content with yesterday's solutions. If we are to transition to sustainable transport, we're going to need to feel a little less comfortable with the status quo.</p>
<p>I'm a lawyer that runs a small climate change not-for-profit in Canada that's working on just that. I'm lobbying cities to pass laws that would require climate change warning labels on gas pumps. The idea is to help people connect the dots to an otherwise abstract, faraway problem. The act of going to a gas station and filling up a car has been normalized for several generations. The warning labels take this unexamined act and problematize it. In creating a sense of dissatisfaction with the prevailing mobility solution, they stimulate demand for alternatives. Please watch my TEDx to learn more: <a href="http://ourhorizon.org/TEDx" title="http://ourhorizon.org/TEDx">http://ourhorizon.org/TEDx</a></p>

<p>This could be the catalyst that makes all those other companies which are questioning the value of holding patents to rethink their position and perhaps follow suit.  I for one hope so.</p>

<p>One suggestion (not a lawyer and don't pretend to be one ...):  Keep getting patents.  But follow through as you have decided.  Because in the nasty world out there when you come up with something cool (as you have!) and don't patent it -- some guy will and they will go after you. </p>

    <p><p>@paul@permanenti...</p>
<p>There is a change in the market occurring.  It is a slow change, but people (traditionally called consumers by economists) are becoming more aware of the bigger picture when they buy a product.  e.g. does my money go to a good cause when I buy this, is the company direction something I agree with, is the company doing good things for humanity etc.  Sharing knowledge is the next step in Tesla's journey to creating positive answers to these types of questions, not to mention the very specific benefits that well supported open source projects benefit from (Tesla I'm sure already receives many unsolicited suggestions for improving their product/knowledge, this will only increase now).</p>
<p>Reading comments from other people on this blog should tell you that Elon/Tesla is on to something here and shareholders need not be concerned.  More people will now want to buy and own a Tesla.</p></p>

    <p><p>Interesting announcement.  </p>
<p>Does this mean that Tesla will incorporate other car makers' patented technology into its cars?  It would be great if the Model S was available with features like Mercedes Benz's Distronic Plus and Driver Assistance Packages. </p>
<p>As innovative as the car is, it does not match some more established car makers' active safety and convenience features. Now that patents are not a problem, I hope Tesla can catch up in this area.</p></p>

    <p><p>Dear Elon Musk, </p>
<p>In 1925 General Electric made the pioneering work of Rice &amp; Kellogg on the pistonic paper cone loudspeaker we know today generally available and free of patent encumbrances. These loudspeakers sounded fabulous and were perfect for Radios, but were inefficient and needed electricity connected to the home to be viable. This was great for GE who wanted to sell light bulbs and appliances – they were banned from selling electricity due to antitrust concerns - and Radios in the home were the key to persuading homeowners to connect up which was a prerequisite for electric  appliances.</p>
<p>In my view the lack of competition led to the complete lack of innovation in the loudspeaker industry which has persisted for nearly 100 years! </p>
<p>There are counter examples in the early semiconductor industry and I clearly don’t have the full facts with access to Tesla Motor’s internal information but Tesla should think carefully about making its electric vehicle IP generally available to spur adoption of electric energy for transportation. It may have the opposite effect that is sought! But maybe Tesla’s goal is the pure play energy business in which case – good move. Maybe!</p>

    <p><p>This is highly commendable.  But as a patent agent myself, I would advise Elon to modify this blog entry slightly : We won't go after you, if you don't go after us.  Tesla is indicating that it's using it's patent portfolio for defensive purposes only.  As such, your patents lose defensive value if you're stating that you will not assert them at all, even in a counter claim after being sued.</p>
<p>Hopefully this will have the desired affect of fostering innovation in electric vehicles.</p></p>

    <p><p>Question: I understand the intent behind this move, but what is to stop the big players (GM, Ford, Chrysler) from co-opting the technology then using it to "corner" Tesla by suing it for exclusive rights to the technology? It is no secret that the old guard and those who sell every day cars are threatened.</p>
<p>I am not sold on the benefits of electric vs. conventional gasoline cars, but I give Mr. Musk major props for being innovative, challenging the status quo, and taking big risks in the hopes that something better can be made. That said, I'd buy a Tesla if I could afford it.</p></p>

    <p><p>Elon you have given us hope.</p>
<p>I was watching the Cosmos episode that talked about global warming and could not help but feel a sense of utter and complete hopelessness for Earth and mankind. It was depressing to think how many of us live for the short-term and don't care about long-term consequences of our actions. "I'm going to die in roughly 60-70 years so why do I care? I'm going to make my life as grand and comfortable as can be while I'm here. Screw the future, I'm not going to be in it" type of attitude.</p>
<p>Even if this does change the world for the better, you have a lot of rich people invested fossil fuels and every business related to it that will do everything in their power to keep their riches from being eaten up by an electric revolution. If they can't make it impossible, they will damn well sure make it is a slow process. They are our biggest roadblock and need to be removed. Tesla's gesture is a much needed boost, but unfortunately it may already be too late. I hope that many companies, governments, and individuals are inspired by you.</p></p>

    <p><p>Wow, what a lot of comments.  Now for mine.  I hope someone else did not already say what I am about to say, but here it is.  Tesla still needs to and will continue to file patent applications as they continue to innovate.  In the age we live in, other manufacturers might try to hurt Tesla by claiming first dibs on technology that Tesla developed.  The point is that it ends up open source, and this may well accelerate innovation in the future, since other companies are allowed to use the technology and possibly improve upon it.  Patent ownership is overrated in nearly every way except protecting yourself from other companies suing you (like one well known mobile device manufacturer that has repeatedly tried to stop another from selling...)</p></p>

    <p><p>Tesla is redefining what "giving back to the society" really meant. I always liked Tesla Motors since I learned about it. I always supported their approach while some people around criticized that Tesla's only meant to cater cars for luxury segment. What many don't understand is that the Model S and Model X were just huge+risky efforts to create a brand amongst the automotive mass markets. Once they found their foot and created identity for themselves, they now plan to enter into the market with an economic model that can cater to the masses. And they are looking to share their technologies and supercharging stations in order to create a standardized network for other automotive companies. They are not afraid that other organizations would just exploit such a situation but rather are afraid of only one thing - ENVIRONMENT. I hope the industry as a whole would join hands to strengthen such efforts from Tesla moving forward into the future.</p></p>

    <p><p>I stopped believing in patents many years ago. They are only useful if a company has deep pockets, plus most products are based on innovation, not invention. It is interesting that Elon came to similar conclusions. He misses one point. Companies are required to include drawings and descriptions when filing for a patent so that the information enters the public domain and others can build on it. I wonder if that's the real reason he will no longer pursue patents.  This actually allows Tesla Motors to be more secretive if they so choose.</p></p>

    <p><p>Are there really any patented technical innovations in Tesla cars? As far as I am aware Teslas are based on the innovative (non-patentable)  realization that there is a limited market for very expensive fast cars that have the snob appeal to make owners feel themselves forward-looking, virtuous, "non-polluters"  (by  ignoring the pollution caused by generating the electricity) and government subsidies.</p></p>

their patents on something they didn't create<br />
but got for nothing creating a monopoly<br />
on a public domain. Shame on you Bill Gates<br />

What a difference comes from Tesla!<br />
They created something that transforms<br />
the world that no competition can even touch.<br />
And they are sharing it into the open source<br />
putting their money in for the greater good<br />
of people.<br />
No wonder they're also using Linux open source<br />

Don't worry Tesla shareholders!<br />
Remember what Larry Page said - that he would<br />
give up all his billions in a heartbeat to Elon<br />
Musk?<br />
Whatch now how many more billions will<br />
shake down towards Tesla in unison with<br />
the same heartbeat for the greater good<br />

    <p><p>And only if this lowly middle class worker could afford such a vehicle. you would not have issues overtaking the big motor companies.everyone and there mother would buy tesla if it was in the range of normal folk.  I first heard about tesla many years ago.  I hope you come out with an affordable car because you are the brand people want right now but can't justify another car payment after almost finishing the previous one</p></p>

    <p><p>Tesla, you say you want to expand your market to the scope of conventional cars, but frankly you seem more concerned with simply proving yourself to be a progressive company with good intentions. Why not make a simple electric car, and get rid of all the extensive luxury items which are driving the price up. A car that feels like a normal car but simply runs on electricity rather than gasoline, that's all that we need, that's how you get people to switch. But what you've given us is a rocket ship that too many people simply dismiss as impractical, and in many ways it's hard to disagree.</p></p>

<p>Thank you for your unique perspective and determination.  I cannot afford one of your beautiful machines right now, but, I relish the day that I will when economies of scale drive the prices down.  Until then, I wish you the best.  I am an engineer myself and I greatly respect what you have been able to accomplish thus far.  I'm looking forward to the future just as you are!</p></p>

    <p><p>Patents were initially designed to induce inventors to stop keeping secrets, in return for a decade or two of exclusive rights.  "Trade secrets" are the alternative, and many still rely on them.  </p>
<p>But TM's IP is under little danger from the majors: they don't want it, and have no wish to out-produce or outperform TM wrt EVs.  They want to keep them in a box, or in a landfill!</p></p>

    <p><p>I'm not sure this is all that bold or amazing. I think it is just good business. A critical problem with electric cars is that there are just not enough of them to create the refueling resources needed to make them practical. If opening Tesla's patents helps to create a more robust electric car market then Tesla and all electric cars will win. </p>
<p>It's a great idea and I know we all hope Tesla and its electric comrades succeed.</p></p>

    <p><p>That's a great idea full of wisdom and courage. EV market needs more successful players to expand it. Obviously, this decission will help to achieve it. As far as production capacity is concerned, as an international semiconductor company with a 6 inch and a 8 inch IGBT fab line and power module assembly line and establishing SiC line, we also have more than 50 years converter design experience and lead the evolution of China's high railway traction system. we are will to work closely with Tesla to provide Tesla specific/standard power electronics module, assembly and subsystem to help Tesla expand its production capacity. I believe there is a visible bright prospect with the combination of high railway technology and Automotive.</p></p>

    <p><p>A very interesting twist. However, I’m not so sure that releasing Tesla patents alone is a smart move. By all means, do that (there may be some who have the resources to do their own thing with the data), but run it concurrently with a few other strategic moves. Join forces with the likes of Nano Flowcell (<a href="http://www.nanoflowcell.com/en" title="www.nanoflowcell.com/en">www.nanoflowcell.com/en</a>) to further develop what promises to be the ultimate battery technology at this stage, and then produce Tesla electric kits at various facilities around the globe (read localised production with minimal transportation) which can be retrofitted to existing vehicles. In my opinion, the primary problem is the continual mass production of new cars; petrol, diesel, electric - it matters not what powers them. The fact is that it takes a huge amount of non-renewable resources to manufacture new vehicles; +- 2 tons of newly extracted materials for each one. Provide the means to upgrade existing cars with easily fitted kits, and a whole new restomod industry could be created. I’m a car nut, but I’m so over this incessant growth/production/consumption thing now. I want to see more reusing/repurposing/restoring, by creating some truly unique vehicles. In fact, this is on my list of hypothetical ventures...</p></p>

    <p><p>Open Source is a very broad term, and, unfortunately, it's not entirely compatible with the concept of patents.</p>
<p>While disclaiming any patent rights is a noble act, it does open up those patents to subversion by third parties. It is easy to imagine that such a third party may minimally modify one of the objects or procedures in one of your patents, and then claim a patent of their own, reserving all rights to such a patent.</p>
<p>Thus, I hope you have not simply waived all your patent holder's rights, but have provided appropriate licensing for all your patents, ensuring, as most Open Source licenses worth mentioning do for software, that your patents cannot be used to create derivative patents for which their owners can then turn around and claim full patent rights.</p></p>

    <p><p>Great! We need more companies to do this, Tesla might inspire them. I do think it's a bold move, but also a smart one. I have a lot of confidence in open source combined with sustainable/growing business around a mission greater than the company itself. I've co-founded Ultimaker, a company that develops, produces and sells open source 3D printers. Our goal is to make 3D printing accessible, giving people freedom to make real things, whatever they can imagine.</p>
<p>We're currently a leading company in this market, founded just a few years ago and doubling every year. We're growing so fast, without outside investment, even though we've open source our entire products. This means, design files, circuit board schematics, firmware and accompanying software. We believe in creating progress through collaboration and sharing, and open source is key part of that strategy.</p>
<p>To me, Tesla and Elon Musk has for a long time been an enormous inspiration to me. It's great to see that our companies share more and more commonalities as time goes by. Plus, I'm a happy and proud Tesla customer (and I believe Tesla is happily making use of our Ultimakers!).</p>

    <p><p>If something seems to good to be true (and sounds like Dilbert) it probably is. Patents are what are known in the competitive capitalist world as intellectual property or IP. The most innovative companies compete for and hire the most innovative engineers who create IP which provides these comapanies equity. If you then give away the IP you have essentially handed your competition your engineers. As an engineer, why would you want to work at Tesla when your innovation, that was patented by your company, was handed to another company and the recogntion of your innovation was removed from the company patent wall. This is truly a boon for all the engineers at Tesla. The big automakers now have the license to hire all of Tesla's engineers and give them the recognition they deaserve. Tesla in return will be out of equity and out of business.</p></p>

    <p><p>Your bold decisions and contributions continue to amaze.</p>
<p>This thought will likely drown in a sea of compliments, but nevertheless: I am eager to see how Tesla Motors will continue the sharing of inventions in the future. Will it stop applying for patents? Then inventions might become less accessible to other manufacturers and researchers. Will it publish them openly? That may help prevent others patenting the same idea. Will we get to an Open Source hardware solution eventually? These are exciting times.</p></p>

Lichtenthaler says "The degree of patent protection does not facilitate successful open innovation". (Lichtenthaler U. 2009)<br />
If we are looking for an open world for knowledge sharing and crowd sourcing of knowledge, then patents do not make sense.</p></p>

    <p><p>it nice to hear that your patents are now free to use. </p>
<p>but for what are these patents for?<br />
the main reason is for over 100 years ago ferdinand porsche has done electric cars and plugin hybrid. even in that time there have been more electric cars on the street than otto motor based cars. it has all changed when the electric ignition was introduced.   </p>
<p>my point of view is that patents for mobility should be forbidden. but that is in the current law not possible.</p>
<p>so at least it would be nice if there will be a non profit organisation that handles all the patents and corporation access to other company that think the same way like tesla. there are a lot of them in this world mostly small company's.</p></p>

    <p><p>Elon thank you for this game changer, challenging the way "things are commonly done" for the betterment of quality of life now and in future on this planet, I would like to buy bonds to further the gigifactory so that there are possibly enough batteries for the 3rd gen Tesla demand worldwide, also, on my wish list is Solar City to finesse solar powered garages in Minnesota, thank you Tesla Motors, Solar City and SpaceX for all you do!!!  Benjamin Franklin, Nikola Tesla, etc, would be proud!!</p></p>

    <p><p>Just read all of the above. Thanks Mr. Musk.<br />
Maybe now you will release the microflitch for the Model S. I asked for this when I received the Model S in March this year,but was told it was not available? I love driving my Model S but that is not the reason I purchased the car. I want to use the 85000 watt battery to power my house during the night, and be able to cut off the Hawaiian Electric utility.<br />
I have 40 PV panels on my roof producing about 9.5 KW<br />
with over 70 LED lights in the house.<br />
I think I will need a large expensive inverter to take power from the Model S, but I am not sure, I do need the microflitch to take it apart and make the modifications to use the power.</p></p>

    <p><p>The spirit of this statement is commendable but the details are unclear. It would be helpful to have a list of the patents covered by this release, and a more legal statement allowing use. Ideally I would like to see these released into a patent pool such as devised by the EFF.<br />

<p>Release into a patent pool would encourage others to also share their patents and prevent this patent release from being withdrawn by future owners of Tesla Motors. </p>

    <p><p>As Elon has said, the way to win in an innovative business is to out-innovate the competition, even surpassing your own accomplishments with new ones.  Relying on defensive patents can breed complacency.</p>
<p>Most engineers I know, including me, want to work at the "bleeding" edge of technology.  When building a career, technical challenge comes first and compensation slides down the list of priorities.</p>
<p>This breathtaking move is reminiscent of Spanish explorer Cortez, who burned his ships on reaching the New World to ensure his crews were well motivated.  Tesla has already created an amazing culture of rapid innovation.  This move will ensure Tesla's engineers are "well motivated" to accelerate their culture of innovation.  Such a culture will serve to attract the very best engineering talent to the cause.</p>
<p>Bravo Telsa!  In the long run, this will be good for everyone (employees, shareholders, customers, industry and planet).  It ensures Tesla will lead from the front and continue to raise the bar for years to come.</p></p>

    <p><p>@Mr. Musk - when a visionary makes a farsighted decision, there will always be naysayers and non-believers.  I concur with your rationale that there should be an open platform to encourage development. Also, patents sometime outlive their usefulness.  </p>
<p>People forget that the formula to Coca Cola has never been patented, and since 1925, it has remained sealed in a vault in an Atlanta bank.  There is a vast difference between protecting proprietary trade secrets and allowing use of disclosed information already subject to a patent. </p>
<p>Let us not forget the format war between VHS (JVC) and Betamax (Sony).  Betamax was clearly the better format, but Sony's decision not to have an open platform caused the Betamax's demise.</p>
<p>I applaud your courage to be farsighted and have an open source philosophy.  Future generations will acknowledge you as trailblazer with a philosophy that made America great.</p></p>

    <p><p>TM is battery constrained. If a TM clone takes place tomorrow, they won't have enough batteries to compete with the same technology, thus will either buy it from TM's gigafactory, or build their own. </p>
<p>The billionaire who bought Fisker might be interested in the patents. If I were Wangxiang, I'd build mines and gigafactories in China in less than half the amount of time Elon can build his at a fraction of TM's cost, while start R&amp;D in the US on next gen today using those patents, and roll out the next generation first in China, then sell them to the US consumer, undercutting Tesla. </p>

    <p><p>Great move, now for the other sectors of the market, the wreck re builders , D.I.Y. builders and hotrod builders.<br />
 These people are small in number but large in p.r.IE; look at the magazine racks and cable/TV shows.<br />
 Tesla has over production/supply of almost everything  except batteries.<br />
 Tesla can further prove it wants to make a non planed obsolescence car. (just shocking)<br />
 Tesla gets free some of the most talented engineering/artistic creative power the world has to offer.<br />
 Tesla creates a link to this world of free thinking/ creativity and fosters it's expansion and education.<br />
 Tesla creates many small after market suppliers,thereby expanding it's brand and suppliers.<br />
 Tesla = inspiration ,the " Lego set" of technology</p></p>

    <p><p>I made an account JUST to clarify the title of this blog. </p>
<p>The title "All Our Patent Are Belong To You"<br />
is in reference to the classic Sega video game Zero Wing.<br />
In the introduction movie/animation it says, "All your base are belong to us."</p>
<p>I'm not 100% but i'm pretty sure the phrase was translated from japanese to english and that's kind of just how it came out. The phrase has it's own infamy floating around in some of the darker places of the internet now.<br />
Just to clarify again, the title was no mistake.</p></p>

<p>This reminds me of IBM's move in 80s to release the reference architecture of IBM PC. I hope this will further spark innovation, enable electric cars to achieve economies of scale, promote interchangeability of components and standardization.</p>

<p>Back in the day, when the Wright Bros. made aviation a reality in the U.S., they spend their remaining business time fighting to protect patents. They never again made any significant contributions to aviation. </p>
<p>It was their contemporaries, the AEA, a group of true aviation geniuses, Thomas Selfridge (killed in a Wright plane), Alexander Graham Bell and Glenn Curtis, who pushed the window on aviation in America. [First plane used in warfare was a Curtis Jenny].  They didn't have any concerns about patents. They were only interested in aviation. Elon Musk would have been an active<br />

    <p><p>This is very cool…. but the cynical side of me can't avoid cataloging in my mind what I know of automotive and oil industry history. For over 100 years, the auto manufacturers have had the to option develop and build electric vehicles.</p>
<p>The first electric vehicle with rechargeable lead acid batteries was built in 1859. </p>
<p>Thomas Edison had his batteries completed and in a Ford in 1913. Mysteriously his batteries "ran into problems" while being shipped to Detroit for integration into the cars, while his battery factory and lab mysteriously burnt to the ground at literally the same time.</p>
<p>In essence, the industry has ignored or outright or worse, purchased and buried promising electric drive systems for cars ever since Thomas Edison's efforts.</p>
<p>The Ovshinsky battery was Robert Ovshinsky's new battery after he invented the high-power, nickel-hydride batteries still used in virtually every hybrid around the world. Lithium-ion is just now replacing NiMH.</p>
<p>The new battery was to be the break through technology way back in the early 2000's that would have caused an exponential growth of electric vehicles around the world.</p>
<p>Chevron bought the company that had the patents and buried the design to keep the world from having it.</p>
<p>What other technology can you think of (besides dirty energy) that stayed stuck on the same thing without progressing for over 100 years? Once the oil and auto industry killed electrics in the early part of the 20th century we remained stuck on internal combustion with no options for alternative ways to move us around.</p>
<p>I have always said, we need to have at least one highly motivated billionaire to get us over the transition mountain that has been built by the oil, gas and auto industries. Even then it was going to be an uphill battle. It appears that Elon Musk is keenly aware of this and has determined that he can't do this alone.</p>
<p>GM should be selling multiple platforms of their highly successful Volt by now, including trucks, vans and SUV's. Instead they come out with an over priced specialty car with the Cadillac ELR. A beautiful car but not one for the masses.</p>
<p>Elon Musk and Nissan have been successful in dragging GM into the alternative transportation world at some level but in my opinion, GM is dragging their feet big time.</p>
<p>It's good to see BMW and Volkswagon enter the EV space but what really needs to happen to get this thing to the next level is…… LARGE FORMAT EV's!</p>
<p>Yes, we have Via Motors, and that is great, but we need to see GM, Ford and Chrysler building innovative large platform truck designs that include PHEV and EV technology. NOT trucks with bigger and bigger internal combustion engines!</p>
<p>You think truckers wouldn't love not buying diesel fuel 2 - 3 times a week? Build a pickup truck with a 300 - 500 kW battery pack and a 1000 horsepower electric motor and they will flock to EV's.</p>
<p>It's time to take the next step and Elon Musk is doing everything he can to make that happen.</p>
<p>Good on you Elon!</p></p>

I congratulate Mr. Musk.</p></p>

    <p><p>Hopefully this will also lead to lower costs so those of us that are not high earners can afford a Tesla. </p>
<p>I would love a high range compact electric but but there is nothing in a price range I can afford. Those I can afford are not worth considering due to extremely limited range (80KM or so).</p></p>

    <p><p>@Victor J W, I agree. One way to populare electric vehicles would be to make them available to the average Joe. I think making an affordable EV for the mainstream clients would do more good for the planet than giving away the patents. </p>
<p>Let's face it, Tesla is still a status symbol and unattainable for most of us. Elon is a very rich man. Maybe, somebody should remind him of what it is like to be struggling middle class. Making Tesla into a luxury item defeats the purpose. </p>
<p>Elon is the messiah of the rich as it is now. Let's hope it will change.</p></p>

    <p><p>AWESOME NEWS!! I seriously was just thinking yesterday, that "I wonder if Tesla would ever consider making a retro-fit kit for existing gasoline cars?" Or even "if I wanted to make my own EV based on my own design, would Tesla be willing to sell me just the drive train to power it. "The Jaeger Axis, powered by Tesla"…</p>

I recently toured the plant here in the Bay Area and was smitten with the tech, and the concept, but sadly I'm not one who can afford a Model S, but now I'm seriously considering the VW E Golf when it arrived later this year as my stepping stone into EV's.<br />
This news however makes the future a bit brighter and a bit closer!</p>
<p> Thanks Elon!!</p></p>

    <p><p>Great move! I speak as one of the pioneers of the Open Source movement in the field of software. Intellectual Property seems like a good idea on the surface but it inevitably allows the powerful to just acquire more and more and more so in the end is bad news for the survival of the human race.</p>
<p>There is another non software release of IP, also related to Tesla (Nicola) that your engineers may like to take a look at <a href="http://www.libertariannews.org/2014/06/05/open-source-free-energy-generator-achieves-33x-overunity/" title="http://www.libertariannews.org/2014/06/05/open-source-free-energy-generator-achieves-33x-overunity/">http://www.libertariannews.org/2014/06/05/open-source-free-energy-genera...</a> </p>
<p>When these things have been worked on before the inventors have had a habit of dissappearing. See Forster Gamble's Thrive film for info about what has been going on. Sharing work as open source avoids that fate. </p>
<p>A hybrid car with this plus batteries for town driving would be awesome!</p></p>

As I wait for delivery of my Model S, I couldn't  reaffirm more my decision to give $90,000 to a company like this. My hesitation to invest in their stocks is now completely gone. The world needs more leadership like this.<br />
Wasn't Nikola Tesla screwed out of patents by Edison and the world remembers Edison as the mastermind and inventor instead of those that made it happen?  Very interesting .......</p></p>

<p>A lot of people are saying AZ is out of the running on the location for the Gigafactory. There are so many reasons to come here. </p>
<p>We have several Open Source user groups in the Valley such as PLUG - the Phoenix Linux Users Group.</p>
<p>We have many technical people who work with non proprietary software and technology with a passion.</p>
<p>Many companies here have open source/free software ambassadors. </p>
<p>I'm here. and... I thank you from the bottom of my heart!</p>
<p>Whether you decide to move that Gigafactory here or not, come visit and speak at one of our Linux User Groups. Last night we were discussing patents and the importance of opening up technology.</p>
<p>I applaud you for your decision and action in moving the arts and sciences forward. Bless you!</p>

    <p><p>I think this is naïve and a big mistake. Tesla is competing against entire countries,  and an iceberg of new technology, which will impact, and blindside (my view) his enterprise.  Does Tesla's lack of success  with the Dealer issue, indicate  a deeper structural problem. My view is yes. How that was blown is beyond me.You have to be born in America and inculcated here to understand what legal angles work,which attorney's work; And understand the legal system, is inbred, old boyish, like the Auto industry? How strange!.  I think there is evidence the operation has analogs to generals fighting the last war. I tried to present Tesla with important auto tech which I am sure they were not intimately savvy with, but could not get past the lieutenants. Not good. <a href="mailto:Sannerwind@gmail.com">Sannerwind@gmail.com</a></p></p>

    <p><p>I approve of this message (and decision).  It also means Tesla can focus on making great cars, rather than honor their patents by starting lawsuits when another company finally decides to emulate Tesla.  Brilliant!  This also proves that patents are obsolete, as is oil by the way.</p>
<p>In a world full of stupidity, dishonesty, and lies, it is always refreshing to catch up on Tesla, the best oasis I know.</p></p>

    <p><p>Mr. Musk:</p>
<p>Great News for those interested in your company's technology!</p>
<p>Can you please back up this press release with actual details/procedures? </p>
<p>Can you please direct those that are interested in practicing your company's patented technology a contact where they can receive a royalty-free, perpetual license to practice your company's technology, as the release suggests? No company will start willfully practice another company's technology without assurances they will not be sued (a press release does not cut it).</p>
<p>Can you have your IT folks upload a perpetual, royalty free licence like the one above, signed by you, so that it can be easily downloaded and signed by companies that want to practice your patented technology?</p>
<p>Can you specify which patents you are actually talking about? Does this mean all of Tesla's patents? In any country?</p>
<p>The spirit behind this press release is great. Now, we need details. </p>
<p>Thank you again for such a generous thing that you are doing.<br />
I,and others, look forward to seeing how you are actually going to get this done.</p></p>

From my perspective as an engineer, inventor, and (gasp!) a patent agent, what incentive do I have to contribute my time and talents to Tesla's open source car.  I believe that Tesla and all companies would be better off by creating a system for inviting and rewarding contributions from individuals across the world.  Currently, the open source movement does not reward contribution so it is about as effective in fueling innovation as a communist collective.</p>
<p>Free markets are successful because they foster the exchange of goods and services.  I believe that patents are currently ineffective because of the effort and complexity (I.e. cost) involved in compensating the inventors and investors behind the inventors including companies.  I believe that the is mainly due to the cost of licensing and litigation rather than patenting.</p>
<p>It is sad and ironic that one of the motivations for having patents, to reward individuals for their creative works, is so inconsistently achieved with our current legal system.  However, the solution to this issue may not be legal per se, but our business culture. I believe that the open source movement attempts to change the culture of product development largely without economic exchange and will consequently be ineffective at accelerating innovation.</p>
<p> I would encourage Tesla and others to not just be "open" but also to create a market for solutions.  Such a market could embrace patents (when advantageous) rather than demonize them!</p></p>

    <p><p>Hi! Good honest move. Patents are pathetic.</p>
<p>The market will verify if you ideas have potential and can be use to make our life better (cheaper) without some hidden monopole ('oil' stations, parts, energy etc.).</p>
<p>Where I can see those patents ?</p>

    <p><p>Tremendous move Elon and somehow made me think about that excellent speech from "the Great Dictator".</p>
<p>“...The way of life can be free and beautiful. But we have lost the way.</p>
<p>Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate; has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed.</p>
<p>We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in; machinery that gives abundance has left us in want.<br />
Our knowledge has made us cynical,<br />
our cleverness hard and unkind.<br />
We think too much and feel too little.<br />
More than machinery we need humanity,<br />
more than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness.</p>
<p>Without these qualities life will be violent and all will be lost.”<br />
― Charles Chaplin, The Great Dictator</p></p>

    <p><p>Very well said, Elon Musk, perhaps more than obvious to all. In saying "Tesla will not initiate patent lawsuits against anyone who, in good faith, wants to use our technology," you have protected the technology. Otherwise, as too often happens in a tough corporate business world, a corporation could patent the technology with no intention of utilizing it, but only to prevent a rival company from using the technology to provide better products for the customers. Another possible effect might be to free Tesla Motors from being locked into its own current focus, and open up a new look at the more basic need, that of providing means for sustainable and fully functional transportation for all. For example, surely it does not require the energy to move a ton of steel, plastic and glass, to move a 165 pound person quickly and safely from place to place, even at hundreds of mph. There are lots of approaches to the actual transportation system's need fulfillments yet to be explored, given the actual freedom to do so.</p></p>

<p>The phrase as it appears in the introduction to Zero Wing.<br />
	This article contains Japanese text. Without proper rendering support, you may see question marks, boxes, or other symbols instead of kanji and kana.<br />
"All your base are belong to us" (often shortened to "All Your Base", "AYBABTU", or simply "AYB") is an Engrish (broken English) phrase that became an Internet phenomenon or meme. The text comes from the opening cutscene of the 1991 European Sega Mega Drive version of the video game Zero Wing[1] by Toaplan, which was poorly translated from the original Japanese version.</p>
<p>The meme developed from this as the result of a GIF animation depicting the opening text[1] which was initially popularized on the Something Awful message forums.[2]</p></p>

    <p><p>Tesla had many patents, and yes he certainly would agree with you on the headaches that comes with them.  I wonder also, if I get my project 'Bmeup' developed, should I do likewise.  Teleporting large objects and humans most certainly would be a huge benefit for humanity and patents would just clutter the advancement.  I also believe Tesla was the originator of the concept to perform this application, however, he did not have technology during his time to bring it forward.</p>
<p>People that were using Tesla's equipment, i.e. Hutchinson, and others; had matter moving through the air - in effect teleporting. Of course many other events happening today also proving its feasibility and the potential to develop it using today's technology (slightly modified).  The technology would only be the product one could patent.</p></p>

    <p><p>Elon Musk isn't afraid of giving away his original technology because he's committed TeslaMotors to continuous innovation. By the time a competitor has copied a design, his engineers will have raised the bar. Also, TeslaMotors will have a huge advantage in battery technology. If the Gigafactory pays off, he will be offering long-range electrics at mid-range prices that will attract a huge buying public. I applaud his gesture, but don't fool yourself into thinking he's taking a big risk to save the planet. It's a sound business decision that also happens to work for the common good.</p></p>

This action is a step toward 2nd Order Change that will influence systemic change toward a better environment and will help educate understanding of the connectedness between values that motivate humans and the economic objectives which their businesses are designed to achieve.  Irregardeless of how this act of sharing will be utilized or speculated, the call to create mutually-expansive-shared-value is a powerful act of generosity and creative leadership.  The tide is coming in…these values and ideas are limitless and will not be defeated.  Thank you for standing firm in truth and prioritizing values which greatly exceed the "bottom line".

    <p><p><b>Paul (paul@permanenti) wrote, <i>"Elon's response on this seems to be that the consumer market for cars is large enough which makes him to seem content with a smaller piece of the pie."</i></b></p>
<p>Actually, <b>Elon Musk</b> merely pointed out the salient fact that though 100% of internal combustion engine vehicles need to be removed from the road, <b>Tesla Motors</b> cannot do it alone.  They cannot supplant the current 100,000,000 unit annual automobile production of the world.  They cannot replace 2,000,000,000 operational ICE vehicles worldwide.  </p>
<p>Even if Tesla were the sole major manufacturer of electric vehicles and doubled their production, every year, for twenty years, it won't be enough to reach that goal.  At that rate, it would take another 12 years for Tesla to match the output of the current world leader in sales.  But other companies would still be producing cars that burn gasoline or other products derived from hydrocarbons the entire time.  It would take another four years to supplant the entire production of ground vehicles worldwide.  But people would still be using the billions of existing ICE vehicles, polluting the air the entire time.</p>
<p>This problem must be attacked from multiple fronts.  Since the existing automotive industry will not change, it is necessary to foster the rise of a separate electric vehicle industry.  It is better to have 25% of the entire EV industry, than to be the sole runner with 2% of the entire automotive industry.</p>
<p><b>Paul continued, <i>"...I wish I can gain his thoughts on how this will affect TSLA stockholders."</i></b></p>
<p>Then you can listen to the <a href="http://www.media-server.com/m/p/6vpa5qod"><b>Q &amp; A with Elon Musk</b></a> that followed the initial announcement.  My take is that investors must understand that Tesla will likely be the biggest manufacturer of electric vehicles for at least the next ten years.  Even with doubling their production output every year over that time, they would be lucky to have between 12% and 13% of the entire automotive market.  </p>
<p>That might be enough to put some smaller players out of business, but everyone else would still be producing scores of millions of hydrocarbon burning vehicles.  People the world over will not just stop buying cars to wait for Tesla's production to catch up with need.  But if another ten electric car companies can arrive in that time frame, each garnering 4% to 8% of the worldwide automotive market, then the death knell can be rung for the internal combustion engine that much sooner.</p></p>

    <p><p>I always thought that a business based on patents does not have a true sustainable advantage. The only thing you should build and protect is the brand name. If you own a new technology, then use it to be the first to market it and build a renowned brand, but don't spend resources trying to protect it.</p>
<p>Tesla also found out that big established competitors rarely make efforts to invest much in niche markets, which ultimately allows new entrants to disrupt some sectors.</p>

This will not only change the way of how business can be done but it will also change mass consciousness thinking because you are truly a Standard in so many ways. This seed will blossom. That's the reason why your technology feels so good and why people love your cars - they radiate your way of thinking. Thank you so much for that gift !</p></p>

    <p><p>This is the thing. Until internal combustion engines are outlawed, all other vehicle power sources will remain uncompetitive. Hey, I'm just as fed up with fossil fuel as the next guy but let's face it, limited range and slow recharge batteries are somewhat inconvenient.<br />
Now if someone discovers how to make a nuclear power source fool-proof, inexpensive and drive a car 2,000,000<br />
miles before refueling, I'm willing to listen.<br />
The only other possibility is fuel cell technology, but that's not inexpensive either.<br />
Hey I'm reasonable,..... maybe someone needs to apply the cat o'nine tails on the in-house inventors with a little more aggressiveness.</p></p>

    <p><p>"...receiving a patent really just meant that you bought a lottery ticket to a lawsuit..." These words ring so true for my colleagues and I, who, only just 6 months ago had to negotiate a settlement in an ownership lawsuit that we felt was completely unjust and ill-advised. Not a single dollar has been earned thus far, save for that earned by the lawyers; investor funding has been seriously affected as a consequence of the suit. In part jest I told my lawyer that I thought that his profession was the single most contributor to inflation. </p>
<p>However,there was a more serious consequence. We had sought protect our invention for the very same reasons described by Elon. We hoped that the example we were setting would be an inspiration to others who live in a developing country like ours that still has an awful lot to learn a lot about innovation as a tool for survival and sustainable growth. That legal action and, now, Elon's initiative has made us quite aware of the need for alternative  strategies in strengthening the innovative culture we would like to see.</p></p>

Great move! I own a Tesla (one of two women and a lot more men in Sweden..) and am a part owner of a leadership company (Gaia) with a vision that corresponds with yours. Our goal is to transform the view of leadership and use people´s true potential more than today. We are building up offices around the world and have an associated partner in California that I would like you to meet. Let´s get in touch!! :)</p>

    <p><p>The title is actually correct given the intention. It's a direct reference to an old Japanese game that was badly translated to English at the time it came out.  Look it up on WikiPedia. Search for "All Your Base Are Belong to Us".</p>
<p>His original blog post title was a clever way of stating his vision without writing it in correct English and creating an even bigger legal debate. It was probably assumed that after a quick search on the web, people, by analogy and comparison, would quickly realize that the post title he probably had in mind was something like "All of our patents now belong to you.", but again saying that in plain English would be tricky. </p>
<p>Kudos to him for the creativity!</p>

    <p><p>A WORD OF WARNING!!!</p>
<p>The Sun Microsystems was also pretty decent company in terms of non-sueing, but later, when the Oracle acquired the Sun Microsystems, Oracle started to use the patents of its acquired Sun Microsystems very offensively.</p>
<p>Unless You take some legal action to make sure that the next party, who gets to own the Tesla Motors and its intellectual property, can not start to use the patents offensively, people must still avoid "stepping on them".</p>
<p>That is to say, the fact that the current owners of the Tesla Motors are decent, does not mean that the next owners of the Tesla Motors and its patents will be decent.</p>
<p>A citation from <a href="https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/entry/the_asf_resigns_from_the">a press release</a> that explains, how Oracle was able to throw out the Apache Foundation and effectively destroyed the Java, regardless of the fact that the Sun Microsystems open-sourced that great project.</p>
<p>"Oracle provided the EC with a Java SE 7 specification request and license that are self-contradictory, severely restrict distribution of independent implementations of the spec, and most importantly, prohibit the distribution of independent open source implementations of the spec."</p>
<p>The "EC" in the citation stood for “Executive Committee".</p></p>

Realmente lo que me gustaría es que hiciesen un cálculo o previsión de negocio en mi país, aquí en Andalucía se cerró la única fábrica automovilistica que teníamos, SANTANA MOTOR en el año 2011 y seguro que a TESLA le podría venir muy bien ensamblar o fabricar en España, como hacen otras empresas, como Ford en Valencia, Opel en Zaragoza, Citroën en Vigo.</p>
<p>¿Por qué no fabricar Tesla en Linares?, seguro que les sale muy muy rentable.</p>
<p>Gracias.</p></p>

    <p><p>"Open Source" moves from code to electro-mechanical engineering to energy conversion efficiencies. Patents once protected enterprising effort and fueled innovation. In too many cases they've become vine-like menaces choking the natural flora of free thought. There's not enough Round-Up in the world to cope with the trolls and little likelihood we'd get a pro bono effort from Monsanto for a targeted herbicide. Apple vs Samsung? Will Pyrrhic become the acceptable norm for IP contests? </p>
<p>Elon Musk and others constitute a new breed whose arrival on the scene may usher forth a new expediency: JIT-C, Just In Time in Carbon terms. The Musk move is not a must for all. There are plenty of initiatives that still depend on and deserve the revenue stream protection that patents provide. Let's not debate an all-or-none buy-in about open IP. Case-by-case sounds like a plan.</p>
<p>In 2008’s “Closing the Innovation Gap” Judy Estrin laments the USA’s innovation ecosystem being at risk. She prescribes 5 core values: Questioning, Risk, Openness, Patience, Trust. Elon Musk is firing on all five cylinders!</p></p>

    <p><p>It was startling to hear during a conversation as part of London Technology Week, that Elon/Tesla had done this. It was therefore a pleasant surprise, when checking the veracity of these claims, to discover this page. In the spirit of the moment I hope both Tesla and wider readers will be interested in some ideas first circulated to a few organizations over a decade ago that could radically enhance the acceleration of Tesla’s growth.</p>
<p>An alternative vehicle design could augment a smaller core battery with two or more ‘swappable’ ‘energy cassettes’ weighing around 40Kg.  The original idea, conceived prior to ubiquitous GPS, was that these could be ‘presented’ to vehicles like wheeled hand luggage, whereupon ‘receiving arms’ would pull them into their under-floor housings. This was so they could be handled by anyone. One can also see these managed by roving trucks liaising with vehicle systems, to intercept owners at mutually acceptable, in-journey exchange-points, where specialists then quickly change them. Alternatively each vehicle or exchange point could have a battery exchange dolly for removing and inserting units.</p>
<p>Drawing from how multi-layered standards protocols accelerated telecoms innovation, ultimately, apart from various dimensional, performance and environmental parameters, there need be no prescriptions as to what technology had to be inside the cassettes. The concept opens multiple innovation paths and can be a stepping stone to a gas-station free future. In the nearer term it can also add flexibility to such vehicles, as when in-journey access to swappable units can either be pre-arranged or has a certainty of being realised, much longer journeys become feasible. Where owners only use such vehicles for local commutes, the bays for heavy swappable cassettes can also be left empty, to increase vehicle efficiency.</p>
<p>Rather more thought has been applied to this and there is also a ‘basket’ of related ideas covering advanced vehicles, freight and public transport I would love to share and build upon in a spirit of open innovation. Whist I have not resolved the engineering issues, based upon my experience and masters’ degrees in Computing and Applied Electronics and Business Administration, I believe there are credible technical and commercial roadmaps forward, encompassing these concepts. It was news about Tesla’s ‘Gigafactories’ that prompted recollection of these ideas some weeks ago. This hugely important move to now release enabling intellectual property to what I understand is the creative commons, prompts this submission. If anyone is interested in collaborating on such projects than can further help the trajectory of humankind, please get in contact via thinkofthefuture dot org. Thank you.</p></p>

    <p><p>I just want to see the world be a better place, I'll set my career advancement aside.  The secret to creating an electric vehicle market is NOT creating a bunch of electric vehicles, that is to say NOT YET, the secret is creating a system of converting the countless combustion engine vehicles all ready out there to electric.  We need to stop throwing away the old and replacing it with new, instead upgrade the old to the new.  Otherwise we are just creating a new problem with billions of combustion engine vehicular trash cluttering up our already limited space.  I see 2 ways of conversion, 1: and the most costly, invest in building conversion stations or garages all around America and the World or 2: the best solution, is to make your enemies your friends(the other car manufacturers being your enemies) and sell them the conversion systems and parts, allow them to make money from the labor, you make money from the conversion systems and parts, they already have the mechanics and garages/stations in place, everybody wins.  Once we have converted massive amounts of combustion engine vehicles to electric, America's and the World's mindset will change, thereby allowing the electric vehicle market to create itself.  Next, create a system of vehicular recycling.  Then, with the governments help, provide large discounts and tax breaks for exchanging your combustion engine vehicle and/or your converted electric vehicle for an all electric vehicle.  Obviously, there are numerous logistical and legal issues to overcome, I neither have the time nor resources to think about and overcome these, but you do.</p></p>

    <p><p>Lots of awesome comments on the business side of this (which I don't want to pass over because its amazing- you just open sourced cars - welcome, world, to the future of everything).</p>
<p>That's been covered in the 400+ comments.  What I think is just beyond epic is that you did it with a 15 year old meme that only hard core engineers/nerds would even understand.  I can imagine the picture of all the major car company's boards screaming to have someone go get a Sega and dragging in a TV to the board room to explain it.  Outside of the patents what else is he trying to say?!? Hilarious.  And I'm sure it happened.</p>
<p>I f**ing love my Tesla.  It feels like a bunch of very, very smart people completely erased their minds of how cars were built and designed a thing to get you places faster, and it happens to have 4 wheels.  First principle framework actually being used to make a tangible thing beyond amazing.  And other people love them too - which is strange - the person in the expensive Porsche is an A**Hole, but even non Tesla owners love the brand and are excited to meet anyone who's purchased the brand.   The technology advancements on lithium ion are beyond compare, but to somehow establish such an amazing brand while doing that is amazing.</p>
<p>Test driving a Tesla was like seeing an iPhone for the first time.</p></p>

    <p><p>An inventor write ...</p>
<p>As someone with three granted patents and a fourth patent application about to be granted in a few days time plus pending patent applications in 43 counties I salute Elon's decision. Tesla Motors through its patent portfolio has created a platform which cries out for standardisation around Tesla's intellectual property - and unpatentable knowhow and marketing rights will consolidate its business. In these circumstances it is very commercially sound to open the company’s patent portfolio up to all acting in "good faith" and Tesla Motors has the financial and intellectual muscle to ensure that this action works to be long term benefit of Tesla shareholders.</p>
<p>Anyone who has any lingering doubts about the validity of Elon's decision should look at a 2008 book called Against Intellectual Monopoly (Hardcover) by Michele Boldrin (Author), David K. Levine (Author). They are two distinguished American economists undertook a critical analysis of how intellectual property law affected innovation. Their findings if better known could have just as revolutionary an impact amongst high church priests of intellectual property protection as Darwin's work on the Origin of Species did on the scientific establishment a century and a half ago.</p>
<p>The heresy which Boldrin and Levine put forward is that copyright and patent protections are not the engines of growth in our civilization.

    <p><p>Intellectual rights were invented to fuel innovation, in pure intellectual and complex things, like novels, mathematics, programs and many others. But patents are very different, in that, even if someone invents a similar thing he cannot put his own intellectual rights into it, thus effectively struggling innovation. In addition intellectual rights are applied to the process, and patents are applied to the result, that's definitely an anticapitalist measure because many things may end up to the same result by using very different procedures.</p>
<p>That's all very tiring and i should not try to expand more, but that all is going to get right when Greeks will conquer the whole lot of America, and apply our good logical laws, in return of what else than heavy taxation? Calcium is a much more natural material to 3d-print than titanium, not so hard properties, but much more abundant.</p></p>

All our Patent are belong to you? Are you kid? This not speak error? In good faith? Teck mogul speak of faith ironic. Sane people are do everything to support Tesla , must be it. World automotive sanity depend on this. So exciting. Can't wait for next what?!</p></p>

    <p><p>As a patent attorney I agree with Elon Musk that Tesla's patents are not very valuable.  Tesla is using a technology largely developed 50-100 years ago, and its "inventions" are minor scientific advances in a crowded field.  The low value of Tesla's patents reflects the genius of the patent system in awarding narrow patent protection to minor technical advances.  Tesla's actual achievement is having packaged an old technology in a very pretty package and challenging the energy paradigm of the oil-based world economy.  Tesla would be better served by trumpeting its actual achievements instead of cravenly appealing to the anti-intellectualism of the current times that considers patents the enemy.  Then maybe the Tesla engineers could find a way to stop my Model S from rattling like a tin can---or better yet borrow that "technology" from the Germans too.</p></p>

    <p><p>Seeing forward to the day when I myself can afford to buy a Tesla..</p>
<p>Meanwhile.. here is som thoughts from me: Instead of using LED lamps in the car, why not have a central lightforce (placed under the hood ?) with separate fiberoptics to every lightsource needed? You would eliminate lots of copperwiring AND weight. </p>
<p>Solarpanels on almost every surface facing the sun, as a complementary to the battery, maybe to use for the AC, fans etc..</p>
<p>Instead of charging stations where the car stands still, build charging lanes where you charge the car with induction technology..</p>
<p>How do you utilize the heat from the electric motors today?</p>
<p>Thinking about using nanotechnology when painting the cars?</p></p>

    <p><p>Since the title is encoded, perhaps the rest of the message is as well?! </p>
<p>Mr. Musk, is this a call to whoever identifies with BEV manufacturing and would like to help disrupting ICE powered vehicles' dominance?!</p>
<p>If so, I couldn't thank you enough. What shall we do in order to benefit from Tesla Motors' Patents, without infringing them? </p>
<p>Do small workshops qualify as well or only OEMs do?</p>
<p>Are BEV Start-Ups under radar?!</p>
<p>This truly is a bold move and completely different from what others did dominating certain markets. An EV market is actually still in its embryo phase compared to how big it could become.</p>
<p>I believe there is no threat to Tesla Motors even if all OEMs on, a global scale, embrace this opportunity, drop what they have been doing in order to shift to BEV production in a blink of an eye. They simply cannot afford doing so, since they cope with lengthly processes better. </p>
<p>Elon Musk must be overloaded with CVs from great people begging him to work together. There couldn't be more intelligent way replying on them all in a single gesture - let's work together! I believe hearing this between the lines :)</p>
<p>It has been two weeks already, since publishing of this note and this is not self explanatory to me  … to whom should I write for fine print, licensing agreements, or finding out how this declaration is going to be practically empowered?</p>
<p>Many thanks Tesla Motors!<br />
Good luck to you all!<br />
Elon Musk, you rock!</p></p>

    <p><p>Elon Musk &amp; Brethren of Tesla Motors;</p>
<p>I need your help. My fiancé &amp; I have been house hunting this past year, we want to buy before we have our ceremony. In this seemingly endless quest of questionable properties, slow-stepping real estate agents &amp; tainted banking systems, we have realized that what is considered “modern living” isn’t the route for us. Through research, it has become obvious there are many obtainable ways of living efficiently. We are trying to allow these methods to be easily accessible to all humans so we can soften the blow we are pounding into the earth on every level. We have to reduce our reliance of fossil fuels, you know this more than anyone. There are off-the-grid living options, but between the loss of energy while converting and the limited storage space of the energy itself, the benefits of going off-the-grid do not always shine brighter than the combustible options that we currently burn through. Energy cannot be created nor destroyed, only shifted. I want to assist you in beginning a wider-ranged shift by building a self-sustaining home. I have seen the visionary works of Michael Reynolds, however the systems his Earthship possess are unattainable for me due to the high price tag that accompanies them. In the spirit of your recent release of all the wonderful patents from the enlightened minds of your company, I am asking for your help in building this home for my growing family. I do not have access to the idealistic consciousness of architects &amp; physicists that you currently possess. With your help, I can show all the powerful souls I surround myself with how necessary and accessible this global change can be. We are going to buy a piece of land to begin this journey on with, or without your help. With the innovative insight that the great minds of Tesla Motors will contribute to the issue at hand, (imagine Tesla Homes) you will change the world. A generation grown alongside the food they eat and raised with the power of actually understanding the development &amp; distribution of energy is a generation tuned into the torus. This Generation; it’s already here. The time is now, and we, the people, are ready to prove our worth to the planet and future of our species.</p>
<p>Life of Love,<br />

    <p><p>"In good faith" ??? It's like keeping the store and giving away the candy. It really is a shame that a certain political philosophy has enveloped such a fantastic company and product. I guess that most of the commenters here must get goose bumps and dewey eyed when a terrorist is released "in good faith" (and we have recent first had knowledge of their brand of good faith). The Model S and it's siblings can stand on their own merits without all the junk science climate hoopla. Why tie a fantastic vehicle to a hoax that is designed to control peoples lives and steal their money. Want to cut CO2 emissions, quit breathing or replace all us humans with robots. Tell me Mr. Musk, will the UAW act "in good faith" when it takes over Tesla?? And... as long as you are in a giving mood, how about giving me a new Model S, top of the line and a Supercharger for my garage. I truly wish you luck.</p></p>

    <p><p>As a career woman who was laid off as an Asst. To CEO I am so upset that I need a job and would love to buy a Tesla. Bring us free energy Elon! Its time to have what Tesla dies for! The greed of those who murdered him should not be lining pockets when the entire world could have free energy hence we coukd feed the masses and it woukd be the most amazing change for our planet. For owners I applaud you! I wish I coukd afford one but I need to find a good position in Exeter NH. I realize this is not a job search page but I believe and have loved Tesla from the early days of my interest in free radiant energy . It is possible if we demand it and stand for it. Congrats Elon for making a change . I hope this is but a pebble that begins a move so all can afford this wonderful way to live ! Let's save the world now guys! Its time to take Tesla dream and make it available to EVERYONE EVERYWHERE! Oh how the Elite energy owners will be crying as thier empire crumbles! I pray to see this in my lifetime or my chikdren see this. My sons have watched the movies and know and have dreams of making free radiant energy a reality . It has begun with a car and Tesla woukd be so proud! Now let's roll! We can so this if we have the elites who are not greedy and want to make it happen. Once its done it done and all the oil has and power companies will be old museums that will destroy our planet. Its up to you all out there with the money and bravery to fight the real people in power and we all know who THEY ARE! They have enough to survive many lifetimes . Let's give all people a chance. Can you imagine how this woukd help people be self reliant and decrease poverty world wide?! Alll I need is a job  and I will buy my Tesla and work to become self reliant . Anyone need an Asst . To CEO? I am expeptional and with years of experience and education I would love to work and to be a part of bringing this dream to the masses woukd make my dream come true! Thanks Elon! I hope one day I can Order one for myself! At least this proves that there are wealthy people out there who want the same thing! I only hope the owners are not greedy owners of oil stocks and getting rich off the poor and buying a Tesla to be yet more wealthy without making a real change. This is amazing! Some day Elon I will order my car and light my home if inly we forge ahead!</p></p>

    <p><p>Tesla is forging ahead with Elon Musk at its helm. I have read many articles and watched video interviews about opening the patents to help drive faster innovation and save the planet too. The market has responded positively to this approach. We look forward to getting the best EV on the road soon and the more EV that sell, the more affordable they become to the consumer.<br />
Feedback on the design, I find the front/bumper part a bit weird, it looks like a mouth &amp; the headlights like eyes. Influenced by Transformers Autobots? Would prefer a more classic design. The back is ok.</p></p>

    <p><p>It's taken me a while to create an account on the site, but I wanted to say that Elon is brilliant. He is changing the world in so many ways! This is an incredible gesture, and shows the true goal of Tesla Motors: revolutionize the vehicle industry, and make a fundamental change in our world. Although we are still pretty far from gaining independence from oil, we are on the right track. Hopefully, automakers will increase the production of EVs, and make them affordable for the general population.</p>
<p>For those criticizing the title, have you ever heard of the phrase "all your base are belong to us"? It's been used in many video games, and it actually originates from a game released in 1991. Just do a Google search for more info. I think the title is clever. It definitely made me smile!</p></p>

    <p><p>Elon, Thank you for sharing your talent and treasure with the world. As I am preparing to end my first round trip journey across the USA between San Francisco, CA and NJ, more than 9,000 miles solo in a 60kw Tesla Model S without a tech package, I am evidence that even low tech people can benefit and be inspired to achieve fantastic travel milestones thanks to you. I hope, like so many others, to meet you and your beautiful family some day. If you want to read about my journey: <a href="http://www.frugaltesla.com" title="www.frugaltesla.com">www.frugaltesla.com</a>  It was mostly written from the car touch screen! Perhaps you can comment there? Thanks again, Frugal Tesla</p></p>

    <p><p>Moved by Tesla's move, i decided to incorporate their examples in my <a href="http://www.ediplis.com/services/patents/?utm_source=tesla_patents_you" target="_blank">page on patents</a>, wherein the patent holders have decided not to press for infringement. Other example included is that of the QR codes inventor, who has also decided to allow usage of his technology without any licensing fee. Go tesla, go!</p></p>

    <p><p>Anyone who has any lingering doubts about the validity of Elon's decision should look at a 2008 book called Against Intellectual Monopoly (Hardcover) by Michele Boldrin (Author), David K. Levine (Author). They are two distinguished American economists undertook a critical analysis of how intellectual property law affected innovation.<br />
<a href="http://www.whatsappforpcxp.com/whatsapp-for-pc-free-download-windows-7-computer/"><b>Whatsapp for PC</b></a><br />
Their findings if better known could have just as revolutionary an impact amongst high church priests of intellectual property protection as Darwin's work on the Origin of Species did on the scientific establishment a century and a half ago.<br />
