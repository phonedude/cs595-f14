The more you practice Python, the better you get — and so about six months ago, I started going to something called Code for DC.</p><p name="6b34" class="graf--p"><a id="6b34"></a>Code for DC is a brigade organized by Code for America, where people work on communal coding projects to help various city governments….get information about city services out to people online. There are Code for America brigades all over the country. And at these meetings, city officials will often come and say “I want to come up with a better way to do…this thing” and the people who go will look at the data that exists and code up a solution.</p><p name="1352" class="graf--p"><a id="1352"></a>I didn’t realize this at first, but everyone who goes to Code for DC….or Code for Honolulu, which designed <a target="_blank" href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/apps/honolulu-answers/" data-href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/apps/honolulu-answers/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">the website below</a>, or Code for Cleveland….ends up belonging to a community.

And to do that, I’m going to bring in two very unlikely…I’ll call them case studies. The first is Coca Cola and the second is an HIV clinic that I volunteered at in Philadelphia for a few years.</p><p name="9126" class="graf--p"><a id="9126"></a>Why Coca-Cola? Have you seen their recent Share a Coke with a friend campaign? It’s designed with a social community in mind. Each Coke can has a name on it. If you see the name of a friend, you naturally are going to take a picture of that can of Coke and tag your friend on social media.</p><p name="8121" class="graf--p"><a id="8121"></a>It’s a brilliant marketing strategy, designed to make everyone become walking brand ambassadors for Coke. And it’s something to think about as you’re designing stories, logos, campaigns, anything really — <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">how do you create an experience that your community will want to sustain by creating connections with each other through you, and thereby strengthening both your brand as well as the community itself?</strong></p><figure name="a0a4" class="graf--figure postField--outsetLeftImage"><a id="a0a4"></a><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 525px; max-height: 427px;"><div class="aspect-ratio-fill" style="padding-bottom: 81.39999999999999%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*4eaq1Hn2YeBhiEidRFQVfg.png" data-width="741" data-height="603" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*4eaq1Hn2YeBhiEidRFQVfg.png" src="https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/600/1*4eaq1Hn2YeBhiEidRFQVfg.png"></div></figure><p name="919b" class="graf--p"><a id="919b"></a>Which leads me in a different direction, to the HIV clinic I worked at in Philadelphia for a number of years. I tested a population of folks who didn’t always want to be there and weren’t always literate — so they couldn’t always read the forms that the Philadelphia Department of Public Health wanted them to fill out.</p><p name="1c16" class="graf--p"><a id="1c16"></a>So we had to think about designing a form that anyone could understand. This sometimes meant reciting the forms verbally or using language that changed based on the audience. And this too, was about creating community. It was about making sure people felt comfortable and would come back and get tested.</p><p name="967a" class="graf--p"><a id="967a"></a>In the clinic, I learned that <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">it’s always important to think about who your audience is — and what the design of your story, series, logo, form, or campaign is — so that your design doesn’t distract from the overall goal. In this case, it was to get our community to feel comfortable and return.</strong></p><h3 name="72c8" data-align="center" class="graf--h3"><a id="72c8"></a>Creating experiences that people want to take part in and share…like with Coke….and creating places that people feel comfortable in….like with the clinic….<strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">are the keys to creating sustainable communities.</strong></h3><figure name="b824" class="graf--figure postField--outsetLeftImage"><a id="b824"></a><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 525px; max-height: 420px;"><div class="aspect-ratio-fill" style="padding-bottom: 80%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*VN8pkQgsjhRcBUrR96crXA.png" data-width="666" data-height="533" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*VN8pkQgsjhRcBUrR96crXA.png" src="https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/600/1*VN8pkQgsjhRcBUrR96crXA.png"></div></figure><p name="c211" class="graf--p"><a id="c211"></a>Back to Code for America’s communities around the country. Here’s a map of all of the Code for America brigades. People come to these brigades not just to learn how to code but to find people like them. The brigades meet in coworking spaces and startups — really anywhere that they can find space. They’re social. Again, Why do people go? To meet other people like them.</p><p name="00b2" class="graf--p"><a id="00b2"></a>In many ways, public media is a lot like Code for America. We also have spaces all over the country.

We have iPads and apps and Kindles and we find communities on places like Reddit — where we can sit by ourselves in darkened rooms spread out across the world, and try to find common ground.</p><p name="fd0c" class="graf--p"><a id="fd0c"></a>But the Internet can also lead to “active constructive participation.” There are meetups and tweetups and ways to find people who like what you do. And then after finding those folks, you generally…do something with them.
