Later, George went on to teach workshops at the Esalen Institute, which was to the human potential movement of the 1970s as the Googleplex or Apple's Infinite Loop is to the Silicon Valley of today. &nbsp;I taught at Esalen with George when I was barely out of high school, and his ideas have deeply influenced my thinking ever since.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eGeorge's ideas were themselves shaped by \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Korzybski\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAlfred Korzybski\u003c/a\u003e, whose 1933 book \u003ca href=\"http://books.google.com/books/about/Science_and_Sanity.html?id=KN5gvaDwrGcC\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eScience and Sanity\u003c/a\u003e&nbsp;kicked off a movement that came to be known as \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_semantics\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGeneral Semantics\u003c/a\u003e. Korzybski argued that many psychological and social aberrations can be seen as problems with language.&nbsp; Consider racism: it relies on terms that deny the fundamental humanity of the people it describes. Korzybski urged everyone to become aware of the process of abstraction, the process by which reality is transformed into a series of statements about reality \u002d maps that can guide us but can also lead us astray.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eOne of Korzybski's most famous statements was &quot;The map is not the territory.&quot;&nbsp; He developed a series of practical exercises to help people become aware of where they were in the process of abstraction.&nbsp; One of &nbsp;the tools he used was a device he called &quot;the Structural Differential.&quot; (Illustration is Figure 4 from&nbsp;\u003cem\u003eScience and Sanity\u003c/em\u003e, with my annotations.)\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003e\u003cimg class=\"left\" src=\"http://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/p/1/000/1ba/30b/260edc6.png\" alt=\"\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p2\"\u003e&nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003e&nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003e&nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003e&nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003e&nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003e&nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003e&nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003e&nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003e&nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003e&nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003e&nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003e&nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003e&nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003e&nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003e&nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003e&nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eThe Structural Differential represents reality as a parabola. Like the universe around us, a parabola is infinite. Dangling from the parabola are a series of circles, each representing the experience of a single individual. Strings from points on the parabola to points in the various circles remind us that while our respective experiences are derived from the same reality, they are not actually identical.

The B quadrant corresponds to the circles in Korzybski's Structural Differential \u002d the experience that we have when we encounter the reality or beingness of something outside ourself. The D quadrant represents the language&nbsp; \u002d the map \u002d we use to describe and understand what we experienced.&nbsp; The C quadrant represents the integration of this new beingness, experience, and map into who we are. In contrast to the alphabetic order of the quadratic labeling, George saw the &quot;firing order&quot; of the perceptual process as being A\u002dB\u002dD\u002dC.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003e\u003cimg class=\"left\" src=\"http://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/p/4/000/1ba/30f/093d980.png\" alt=\"\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eLike Korzybski, George focused on creating an awareness of where you were in the process of perception.&nbsp; But unlike Korzybski, who simply saw it as a process of abstraction, George saw it as a process of learning and growing \u003cem\u003ewho we are\u003c/em\u003e.&nbsp; After working with him for a few years, I got a near\u002dinstinctive sense of when I was wrapped in the toils of the words we use about reality and when I was paying attention to what I was actually experiencing, or even more, reaching beyond what I was experiencing now to the thing itself.&nbsp; When faced with the unknown, a certain cultivated receptivity, an opening to that unknown, leads to better maps than simply trying to overlay prior maps on that which is new.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003e(There's a lot more to George Simon's work than that, and what I've written elides a lot, but that should suffice in the current context!)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p2\"\u003eSome years later, University of Chicago psychologist \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Gendlin\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eEugene Gendlin\u003c/a\u003e&nbsp;described a similar process in his book \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Focusing\u002dEugene\u002dT\u002dGendlin/dp/0553278339\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFocusing\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e.&nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eLest this seem like mystical mumbo\u002djumbo, let me end with a wonderful quote from Richard Feynman's autobiography, \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Surely\u002dFeynman\u002dAdventures\u002dCurious\u002dCharacter/dp/0393316041\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSurely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e.&nbsp;Both as a student and as a professor, Feynman was fond of playing jokes on people by presenting mathematical or physical laws in unexpected contexts, and finding that his listeners didn't recognize them, and were completely puzzled.

If it doesn&rsquo;t meet customers&rsquo; needs, you lose.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe &ldquo;User&rdquo; is the Citizen, Not the Federal Agency\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThose in government who don&rsquo;t understand just how much implementation matters to the ultimate success of their policies are doomed to create terrible user experiences for citizens.

In top Silicon Valley companies, the management is deeply involved both in framing the problems to be solved and the implementation of those solutions. The leaders are deeply technical, and deeply concerned with user experience. Even in companies that aren&rsquo;t led by engineers, top engineering management has a seat at the highest levels of decision making. And executives who are not themselves technical understand that they must gain a level of technical familiarity at least akin to their understanding of the law, finance, marketing, and PR, so that they can engage in meaningful conversations with those who have a deeper understanding than they do. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cul\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eHiring technical, design, and project management talent into government is too difficult.

On Charlie Rose, Steven Brill explained how he first came to dig into the Code Red story. He was researching the healthcare.gov project long before it had failed, but soon recognized just how likely it was that it would be the disaster that it turned out to be: &ldquo;Almost as a conversation starter, I asked each of these people [I was interviewing] who was in charge of the project.

(Unfortunately, I don't have a specific link.) Why, Lewis was asked, would anyone in the financial industry talk to him for his book \u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Big\u002dShort\u002dInside\u002dDoomsday\u002dMachine/dp/0393338827/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Big Short\u003c/a\u003e after the devastating picture of Wall Street he'd painted in his first book, \u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Liars\u002dPoker\u002dMichael\u002dLewis/dp/039333869X\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLiar's Poker\u003c/a\u003e, nearly twenty years earlier? You have to understand, Lewis replied (more or less), that many of those people got into the financial industry after reading his book. Their big takeaway was how easy it was to make a lot of money without regard to the niceties of creating much value. He finished with the memorable line, &quot;You never know what book you wrote until you know what book people read.&quot;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eThat turned out to be a major problem for me at O'Reilly. I talked so much about our ideals, our goal to create more value than we capture, to change the world by spreading the knowledge of innovators, that I forgot to make sure that everyone understood that we were still a business. Even when I said things like &quot;Money in a business is like gas in the car. You have to fill the tank, but a road trip is not a tour of gas stations,&quot; people heard the &quot;road trip is not a tour of gas stations&quot; way louder than they heard &quot;you have to fill the tank.&quot;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eAs a result, we've had countless struggles to have employees take the business of the business as seriously as they should. I was always pretty good at finding the sweet spot where idealism and business reality meet, but I didn't spend enough time teaching that skill to everyone on my team. And I didn't check in enough about what people were actually hearing when I talked. As Lewis said, &quot;You never know what book you wrote until you know what book people read.&quot;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eReflective listening is an important skill. If I were starting O'Reilly all over again, I'd spend a lot more time making sure that the culture I was trying to create was the one that I actually did create!

Bill won my enduring affection with his honest advice after our lunch: &quot;I don't think you want our money. You'd come to hate us. You have different goals than we do.&quot; Bill is now a member of O'Reilly's board \u002d I believe the only time he's taken a board seat in a company he didn't fund.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p2\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI came to learn the truth of Bill's statement about cash and control in the 90s. Publishing is a fairly cash\u002dintensive business. You pay advances to authors \u002d many of whom never come through with the books they promised to write, or take way longer to complete them \u002d and as your editorial, design, and production team works hand in hand with the author, you may have years of investment before you see a penny back. And in the old days, before ebooks and print\u002don\u002ddemand, you then had to invest tens of thousands of dollars in inventory costs for each book. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eO'Reilly was like a leaky bucket. We were always profitable on a P&amp;L basis, but we never had enough cash. And as our publishing business accelerated through the 90s, we needed more and more of it. We borrowed against our receivables and our inventory, juggled payables till our CFO was blue in the face, but we ended up funding our growth through a variety of equity exits from companies we'd spun out and sold, like GNN, or invested in, like \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogger_(service)\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBlogger (Pyra Labs)\u003c/a\u003e, former O'Reilly employee Evan Williams' first company.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eWe'd sold GNN to AOL for what seemed at the time the princely sum of $15 million, much of it in stock. We were locked up for a couple of years, but because of our pressing cash needs, we had to sell our stock as soon as it became available, netting $30 or $40 million because of the increase in AOL's value as the Internet bubble inflated. That was a nice win, but if we'd had the leisure to hold on till the peak, our stock would have been worth $1 billion, and even if we hadn't timed things perfectly, several hundred million.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eWhere the shit really hit the fan was after the dot com bust of 2001. We were seriously in debt again, our business was in free fall (shrinking by 30% over the next 3 years before rebuilding), our banks pulled our loans and nearly put us out of business. (Banks are fond of lending you money when you are doing well, but watch out whenever you're in trouble! They are the first to the exits.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p2\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI still remember the day I had to decide which employees to cut in our first\u002dever layoffs. As I pored over the worksheets, I noticed hair all over my papers. I was so stressed that my hair was falling out.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eWhat was sad was that it didn't need to be that way.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eIn the depths of the crisis, we hired a new CFO (Laura Baldwin, now President and COO), who instituted new financial controls and discipline. She renegotiated contracts with suppliers. She ruthlessly cut non\u002dperforming titles, freeing up the cash from inventory. And she was the one who persuaded me to do the layoffs rather than going down with the ship and all hands.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eThe difference was enormous. We rebuilt O'Reilly's revenues and profits through successful new books and conferences, the growth of Safari Books Online (which we'd launched right in the middle of the crisis), Maker Media, and other new businesses. But the biggest impact may well have been the one that Laura had, on our cash.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eLet me put it this way: during the 90s, our \u003cem\u003eaverage\u003c/em\u003e revenue per title from publishing was over $250,000. After the bust, it slipped to below $100,000 and never recovered. Yet during the 90s, we were always bleeding cash, while since the bust, we have put tens of millions of dollars in the bank through positive cash flow. That has given us money to invest in new ventures and business transformation as the world continues to change around us.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eThere are four lessons here:\u003c/p\u003e\u003col\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFinancial discipline matters. It really matters\u003c/strong\u003e. If you're a venture\u002dbacked startup, financial discipline gives you more control over when you have to go out for that next round. If you're self\u002dfunded, financial discipline lets you invest in what's important in your business. So many companies agonize over the quality of their product, and work tirelessly to build their brand, yet pay the barest attention to their financials. Money is the lifeblood of your business. Take it seriously. You have to get good at managing it.\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTreat your financial team as co\u002dfounders\u003c/strong\u003e. They aren't just bean counters. They can make the difference between success and failure. Don't just look for rockstar developers or designers, look for a rockstar CFO. Hire someone who is better than you are, who can be a real partner in growing the business. Before Laura came on board, I was always the most numerate person in the organization, the one with the most sensitive finger on the pulse of our financials. (I would often tell our previous CFO &quot;Those numbers look wrong \u002d check them!&quot; because I had so internalized the ratios and average monthly spend by category that I knew immediately when something was out of line.) Even if you're a good entrepreneur with a nose for where money intersects your vision, a first class financial team focused on building effective controls, managing expenses, and optimizing the system will be well worth it.\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHold Teams Accountable for their Numbers\u003c/strong\u003e. Every manager &mdash; in fact, every employee &mdash; needs to understand the financial side of the business. One of my big mistakes was to let people build product, or do marketing, without forcing them to understand the financial impact of their decisions. This is flying blind \u002d like turning them loose in an automobile without a speedometer or a fuel gauge. Anyone running a group with major financial impact should have their P&amp;L tattooed on their brain, able to answer questions on demand, or within a few moments. It isn't someone else's job to pay attention. Financial literacy doesn't come naturally to everyone. Make sure it's part of your employee training package, and make sure that people running important business functions are held accountable for their numbers.\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRun Lean, Reinvent Tirelessly\u003c/strong\u003e. After the bust, we laid off 20% of our staff, and while we missed many of them intensely on a personal level, as a business, we didn't skip a beat. So many people were doing things that just didn't need doing! Maybe those things had once been necessary but had outlived their usefulness, but many of them were just cruft that had accumulated in the organization. \u003cbr\u003eThe \u003ca href=\"http://theleanstartup.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLean Startup\u003c/a\u003e methodology emphasizes measurement in quest of product\u002dmarket fit, describing a startup as &quot;a machine for learning.&quot; This is great. But you need to turn these measurements not just outward on the market but inward on your organization. What is the impact of each activity? Who could be repurposed towards something with greater impact? Does this job really need doing? Can it be done more efficiently and effectively?

While most of the people we laid off were great employees who went on to find good jobs elsewhere, we were appalled to discover that there were some people who had built themselves a nice, cozy position but weren't working very hard. While most of us were pulling the wagon, they were simply riding on it. We even discovered several cases of fraud! That goes back to my point above about the importance of a crack financial team \u002d one of their key jobs is to have strong controls in place. I would never have believed that one of my employees would do that. It can happen to any company. The longer you are in business the more outrageous things you will have employees do on your watch!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eLooking back, I had an extremely naive view: everyone was inspired by the same motivations as I was, passionate about their work and the impact that we were having. They loved their job and wanted to be great at it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eIf you want that to be true, you can't just believe it, you have to work at it! You need a real emphasis on hiring, training and mentorship \u002d and firing! Every manager in the company has to be an expert on his or her staff \u002d what makes them tick \u002d and as focused on finding &quot;employee\u002dcompany fit&quot; as the product and marketing team are in finding product\u002dmarket fit. And HR can't just be the complaint department. It needs to be an active partner in talent acquisition, culture, and leadership development.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eWhen someone isn't right for the job, it's easy to shrink from the confrontation of telling them so, or to accept 60% or 70% of what you wanted because you think you can't afford the time and trouble to find a replacement. You aren't doing anyone any favors. An employee who is not performing at 100% is as aware as you are of that fact, and most likely isn't happy about it. Having the courage to ask them to move on is an essential management skill. (It doesn't even have to be firing \u002d it can be coaching them to make the decision on their own.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eLooking back, I wish we'd worked harder early on to build an organization in which human potential isn't just expected and taken for granted but is also nurtured, if necessary with tough love. \u003cspan\u003eSo many times I knew that someone was doing less than we had a right to expect, but I'd let their manager protect them. I didn't have the guts to keep working the issue till we understood what to do and took appropriate action. We ended up building a culture where managers too often compensated for the failings of employees by working around them, either working harder themselves, hiring someone else to fill in the gaps, or just letting the organization be less effective. We're doing much better today, but we still have a long way to go.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eSo, if you have a bad feeling about the role someone is playing in your organization, work the issue until you feel right about it. Take management seriously!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eThe same lesson applies on the product and marketing side. I never regretted raising the bar \u002d sending a book back for more work at the last minute even though the author and editor thought it was done (in the early days, I used to read every O'Reilly book), deciding that the hotel the team had selected for the first Perl Conference was too cheap and didn't set the right tone, and we had to move to another one \u002d but I look back at the many times I let something go by that I shouldn't have because the team would be upset, and I regret every one of them.

Sometimes that's really true, but often it's just because you hire people who aren't as good as you are at the things you're good at, and don't hire people who are better than you are at the things you don't do so well. You hire supplements to do more of what you already do, rather than people who really complement your skills.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eI already mentioned how I went through the first 20 years of my company's life without hiring someone who was better on the financial side than I was.

We were product\u002ddriven, idea\u002ddriven, and while we developed a unique and powerful style of activism\u002ddriven marketing, we never developed the kind of analytical marketing discipline that someone like Alistair Croll describes so well in his book \u003ca href=\"http://leananalyticsbook.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLean Analytics\u003c/a\u003e.

She drew a pyramid with four layers:&nbsp; Mission at the top, then Strategy, then Programs, then Activities as the broad base.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eSo, for example, Code for America's mission is to help government work better for everyone.&nbsp; Its strategy for doing that is to bring best practices from the technology industry into city governments as a way of making them more agile, more transparent, and more engaged with citizens.&nbsp; Its programs \u002d the concrete embodiments of that strategy \u002d include the \u003ca href=\"http://codeforamerica.org/fellows/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFellowship\u003c/a\u003e, a volunteer \u003ca href=\"http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBrigade\u003c/a\u003e, the \u003ca href=\"http://codeforamerica.org/2012/10/02/cfa\u002dpeer\u002dnetwork/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePeer Network\u003c/a\u003e, and the Civic Startup \u003ca href=\"http://codeforamerica.org/accelerator/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAccelerator\u003c/a\u003e.&nbsp; Cities were chosen as the focus because they are the most tractable level of government, with the most immediate impact on citizens, and because demographic trends are making them the most important level of government in the 21st century.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eThe Fellowship recruits talented technologists for a year of service working with cities that present interesting problems that will make government work better, but more than that, have the potential for re\u002duse by other cities.&nbsp; The Brigade recruits technologists and activists who can't give a year of service, but can do occasional volunteer coding, documentation, open government activism, or other work to spread the applications developed by the Fellowship or other civic innovators to cities that are not yet part of the program. The Peer Network is a way for innovators in city government (including past and future participants in the Fellowship program) to share ideas and best practices, to work together on standards, and to share applications that are developed by the Fellowship or by other government innovation efforts.&nbsp; The Civic Startup Accelerator works to support an entrepreneurial ecosystem (including, potentially, startups developed by Fellows who want to continue to build and support applications created during their Fellowship year), so as to create a richer environment in which civic technology innovation can flourish.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p2\"\u003e&nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003e\u003cimg class=\"left\" src=\"http://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/p/2/000/1ba/307/10b22a1.png\" alt=\"\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p2\"\u003e&nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eYou can see how these programs complement and support each other.&nbsp; And you can also see how each of them in turn rests on a set of activities.&nbsp; Each year, Code for America needs to recruit new Fellows (in 2012, 550 applications for 26 Fellowship spots), new cities (in 2012, 30 applications for eight city partner spots). The organization, like all non\u002dprofits, needs to raise funds to operate.&nbsp; (Though participating cities pay for the direct costs of their Fellows, the rest of the organization's operating funds come through grants and donations.) Brigade members need to be recruited and deployed on useful projects. Accelerator companies also need to be recruited and supported.&nbsp; And the Peer Network needs to be nurtured through a set of activities supporting professional networking, including regular working groups and an annual \u003ca href=\"http://cfasummit.org/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCode for America Summit\u003c/a\u003e.&nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eNow, here was Jen's key point:&nbsp; &quot;We're a small organization.&nbsp; We can't do everything.&nbsp; And we're constantly being asked to support open government activities that don't fit with our programs. While helping to launch a Code for Europe or Code for Africa, or working with the Federal or State government, would be consistent with our mission, it is defocusing because it doesn't support our strategy, which is to start with cities. And it doesn't help build any of our programs.&quot;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p2\"\u003eEven activities that might seem consistent with our mission and our strategy may not be appropriate unless they are tied to specific program outcomes.&nbsp; And what is appropriate changes over time.&nbsp; For example, sending a staff member to run a hackathon in a particular city might have been a great way to recruit cities or Fellows early in the organization's history, when it had limited visibility.&nbsp; But now, the organization has a fair amount of national visibility, and the key role of staff is to recruit local Brigade members to run events like that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eFinally, in a growing organization, the pyramid is also growing, both in terms of the scale of programs and activities, and sometimes by the development of new programs.&nbsp; For example, Code for America began with one program: the Fellowship.&nbsp; The Brigade grew out of the dual recognition that there were hundreds of Fellowship applicants who had to be turned away but who still wanted to contribute, and that there were hundreds of cities that wouldn't be reached by the Fellowship for years, but that could still benefit from its work.&nbsp; The Peer Network likewise grew out of the recognition that we needed a way for cities to continue to work together once they had worked with the Fellowship.&nbsp; And the Accelerator grew out of the conviction that one of the best ways to make sustainable change in how cities use technology to improve government for all citizens is to grow the commercial ecosystem of companies providing civic services in new ways. Jen made the strategic decision not to scale the Fellowship program to include more cities and Fellows, but instead to find ways to scale and spread the impact that each of the city/Fellowship partnerships was making.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eApplying This Thinking to O'Reilly\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p2\"\u003eAt O'Reilly, our mission is to change the world by spreading the knowledge of innovators.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p2\"\u003eOur core strategy is to find interesting people outside the company who are at some kind of cutting edge of innovation, and to amplify their effectiveness.&nbsp; We initially did this by capturing their knowledge and best practices in books, so that others could learn from them.&nbsp; We later realized that we could powerfully advance our mission by creating events that bring innovators together at conferences and other types of meetings, including &quot;unconferences,&quot; small\u002dscale working groups, and massive public events like \u003ca href=\"http://makerfaire.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMaker Faire\u003c/a\u003e, where they can share their enthusiasm.&nbsp; We also realized that we could help them build startups \u002d hence our early stage venture capital business, \u003ca href=\"http://oatv.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eO'Reilly AlphaTech Ventures\u003c/a\u003e.&nbsp; O'Reilly is a much bigger and more complex organization than Code for America, so I won't recount all of our programs, but you should be able to see the pattern.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p2\"\u003eBecause people are at the center of our mission, we've recently reorganized from a product\u002dcentered organization (Books, Conferences, Online Learning, Video, Research, Investing), into what we're calling &quot;Practice Areas&quot; focusing on particular cutting edge communities and the technologies that bring them together \u002d for example, \u003ca href=\"http://oreilly.com/data\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eStrata\u003c/a\u003e&nbsp;for data science, \u003ca href=\"http://oreilly.com/velocity\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eVelocity\u003c/a\u003e&nbsp;for web performance, and&nbsp;\u003ca href=\"http://toc.oreilly.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTools of Change for Publishing.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p2\"\u003eOur second core strategy is to identify &quot;big ideas&quot; that frame the work of the innovators we discover, to show how they are part of a broader movement.&nbsp; We don't market our products: we make heroes of the people at the cutting edge of innovation, and tell stories about what makes them important. The transformation of media by the World Wide Web, the Open Source Software movement, Web 2.0, Open Government (&quot;Gov 2.0&quot;), and the Maker movement are all examples of broad technology trends that we've named and nurtured.

We need to recruit them as authors, conference speakers, and startup founders. We need to build channels for distributing our products.&nbsp; We need to find attendees and sponsors for our events.&nbsp; We need to transform our book publishing program to the ebook era. And so on.&nbsp; And so on.&nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003e\u003cimg class=\"left\" src=\"http://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/p/4/000/1b6/3cc/166954b.png\" alt=\"\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p2\"\u003eBut it's easy to do things that support our mission without driving the activities that support our programs to implement our strategy.&nbsp; For example, when we run an event like Foo Camp, an unconference designed to help us suss out interesting futures and people at interesting edges, it's easy to over\u002dweight our friends (forgetting the research and outreach nature of the event), or to fail to invite people who would advance specific strategic initiatives at the company.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p2\"\u003eAnd it's easy to fall into silos, so that we support only one part of the pyramid rather than the whole thing. We've had many a missed opportunity because we didn't realize that one of our authors would be a terrific conference presenter, or that one of our conference presenters was cooking up a startup that we would have wanted to invest in.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p2\"\u003eWhat I love about Jen's notion of the strategic pyramid is that it reminds us that mission and strategy aren't enough. Yes, as they say, execution is everything. What the strategic pyramid helps you to do is to identify the foundations that support your mission, and to make sure that the whole thing adds up. So many of us build organizations that look like Rube Goldberg devices, with unsupported activities that fit with the mission but have no chance of success because they are under\u002dresourced, activities left over from past strategies, and programs that don't actually support where we're trying to go.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eWhat's also wonderful about the pyramid is that it reminds us that the base is always broader than the top. All of the activities of the organization need to hang together.&nbsp; So many times, a company's new strategic initiatives get lots of attention, but the execution depends on the work of many people who run supporting activities at the company. A true understanding of the strategic pyramid requires constantly valuing and investing in the base of the pyramid as well as in new programs and strategic initiatives.\u003c/p\u003e","permLink":"20121119193311\u002d16553\u002dlinking\u002dmission\u002dto\u002dstrategy\u002dand\u002daction","publishDateAsString":"Mon Nov 19 19:33:11 UTC 2012","_partial_post":{},"imageUrl":"http://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/p/2/000/1ba/307/10b22a1.png","publishedDate":1353353591000,"state":"PUBLISHED","_fmt_publishedTime":"November 19, 2012","url_image_thumb":"https://media.licdn.com/media\u002dproxy/ext?w=60&h=40&f=c&hash=x0KgizVJfOxX%2FJom0ZE%2FFzSJ4dk%3D&ora=1%2CaFBCTXdkRmpGL2lvQUFBPQ%2CxAVta9Er0VyvlxIbjBAo46qP40y_6QhKVZCTD3DjRGW1\u002dMqAYHf2eJWOZrGho0IXeH4DklUzYa_2Fw"},{"articleId":7110,"publishDate":1352753133000,"publishArticle":true,"stockImageUrl":"http://s.c.lnkd.licdn.com/scds/common/u/img/pic/pic_pulse_stock_article_1.jpg","_link_postLink":"http://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20121112204533\u002d16553\u002dvalue\u002dcreation\u002dvs\u002dvalue\u002dcapture\u002dmusings\u002don\u002dthe\u002dnew\u002deconomy?trk=mp\u002ddetails\u002drr\u002drmpost","impressions":23660,"title":"Value Creation vs. Value Capture: Musings on the New Economy","authorId":16553,"content":"\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eIt's easy to see that we live in a natural world that was given to us &quot;for free&quot; and how much of the value we enjoy as a society was not created but extracted from that feedstock of abundance.

Like the universe around us, a parabola is infinite. Dangling from the parabola are a series of circles, each representing the experience of a single individual. Strings from points on the parabola to points in the various circles remind us that while our respective experiences are derived from the same reality, they are not actually identical. One person may experience things that another misses, and even when we experience the same external event, our experiences are not the same.&nbsp; That's why there is only one parabola but multiple circles.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eDangling from the circles are a series of tags \u002d the labels \u002d the words and descriptions that we each apply to our experiences.

The A quadrant corresponds to Korzybski's parabola (or at least some subset of it), the beingness of the thing itself. The B quadrant corresponds to the circles in Korzybski's Structural Differential \u002d the experience that we have when we encounter the reality or beingness of something outside ourself. The D quadrant represents the language&nbsp; \u002d the map \u002d we use to describe and understand what we experienced.&nbsp; The C quadrant represents the integration of this new beingness, experience, and map into who we are.

Framing ideas in such a way that they include and reinforce the identity of a group of people who might not previously have seen themselves as part of the same community allows everyone to tell their own story in a way that adds up to something bigger than any one of them might tell alone.

But the PR we did focused on the technologies themselves and the people behind them rather than on our products.&nbsp; We remembered Brian Erwin's lesson: &quot;People don't care about books.

<p class="p1"><em>I've twice given an Ignite talk entitled <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/timoreilly/language-is-a-map-pdf-with-notes" target="_blank">Language is a Map</a>, but I've never written up the fundamental concepts underlying that talk. &nbsp;Here I do that.</em></p><p class="p1">When I first moved to Sebastopol, before I raised horses, I'd look out at a meadow and I'd see grass. But over time, I learned to distinguish between oats, rye, orchard grass, and alfalfa. Having a language to make distinctions between different types of grass helped me to <em>see</em>&nbsp;what I was looking at.</p><p class="p1">I first learned this notion, that language is a map that reflects reality, and helps us to see it more deeply - or if wrong, blinds us to it - from George Simon, whom I first met in 1969. Later, George went on to teach workshops at the Esalen Institute, which was to the human potential movement of the 1970s as the Googleplex or Apple's Infinite Loop is to the Silicon Valley of today. &nbsp;I taught at Esalen with George when I was barely out of high school, and his ideas have deeply influenced my thinking ever since.</p><p class="p1">George's ideas were themselves shaped by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Korzybski" target="_blank">Alfred Korzybski</a>, whose 1933 book <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/Science_and_Sanity.html?id=KN5gvaDwrGcC" target="_blank">Science and Sanity</a>&nbsp;kicked off a movement that came to be known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_semantics" target="_blank">General Semantics</a>. Korzybski argued that many psychological and social aberrations can be seen as problems with language.&nbsp; Consider racism: it relies on terms that deny the fundamental humanity of the people it describes. Korzybski urged everyone to become aware of the process of abstraction, the process by which reality is transformed into a series of statements about reality - maps that can guide us but can also lead us astray.</p><p class="p1">One of Korzybski's most famous statements was &quot;The map is not the territory.&quot;&nbsp; He developed a series of practical exercises to help people become aware of where they were in the process of abstraction.&nbsp; One of &nbsp;the tools he used was a device he called &quot;the Structural Differential.&quot; (Illustration is Figure 4 from&nbsp;<em>Science and Sanity</em>, with my annotations.)<em><br></em></p><p class="p1"><img class="left" src="http://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/p/1/000/1ba/30b/260edc6.png" alt=""></p><p class="p2">&nbsp;</p><p class="p1">&nbsp;</p><p class="p1">&nbsp;</p><p class="p1">&nbsp;</p><p class="p1">&nbsp;</p><p class="p1">&nbsp;</p><p class="p1">&nbsp;</p><p class="p1">&nbsp;</p><p class="p1">&nbsp;</p><p class="p1">&nbsp;</p><p class="p1">&nbsp;</p><p class="p1">&nbsp;</p><p class="p1">&nbsp;</p><p class="p1">&nbsp;</p><p class="p1">&nbsp;</p><p class="p1">&nbsp;</p><p class="p1">The Structural Differential represents reality as a parabola. Like the universe around us, a parabola is infinite. Dangling from the parabola are a series of circles, each representing the experience of a single individual. Strings from points on the parabola to points in the various circles remind us that while our respective experiences are derived from the same reality, they are not actually identical. One person may experience things that another misses, and even when we experience the same external event, our experiences are not the same.&nbsp; That's why there is only one parabola but multiple circles.</p><p class="p1">Dangling from the circles are a series of tags - the labels - the words and descriptions that we each apply to our experiences. We are reminded that words are derived from our experience but are not the same as that experience, and that the experience is not the same as the underlying reality.</p><p class="p1">Korzybski would have people finger the structural differential when they were talking, asking them to become more aware when they were at the &quot;label&quot; level, when they were talking about their experience, and when they were pointing most authentically at the thing itself.</p><p class="p1">George Simon took this idea one step further. Influenced by <a href="http://www.miraura.org/teaching.html" target="_blank">the Integral Yoga of Sri Aurobindo</a>, who argued that human consciousness was in the process of evolving, that it was possible to grow in spirit by taking in higher levels of consciousness (non-physical, non-verbal elements corresponding to things in Korzybski's parabola that do not necessarily &quot;make sense.&quot;)</p><p class="p2">George generalized this into a model of perception and psychological growth that he represented by a quadratic structure. The A quadrant corresponds to Korzybski's parabola (or at least some subset of it), the beingness of the thing itself. The B quadrant corresponds to the circles in Korzybski's Structural Differential - the experience that we have when we encounter the reality or beingness of something outside ourself. The D quadrant represents the language&nbsp; - the map - we use to describe and understand what we experienced.&nbsp; The C quadrant represents the integration of this new beingness, experience, and map into who we are. In contrast to the alphabetic order of the quadratic labeling, George saw the &quot;firing order&quot; of the perceptual process as being A-B-D-C.</p><p class="p1"><img class="left" src="http://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/p/4/000/1ba/30f/093d980.png" alt=""></p><p class="p1">Like Korzybski, George focused on creating an awareness of where you were in the process of perception.&nbsp; But unlike Korzybski, who simply saw it as a process of abstraction, George saw it as a process of learning and growing <em>who we are</em>.&nbsp; After working with him for a few years, I got a near-instinctive sense of when I was wrapped in the toils of the words we use about reality and when I was paying attention to what I was actually experiencing, or even more, reaching beyond what I was experiencing now to the thing itself.&nbsp; When faced with the unknown, a certain cultivated receptivity, an opening to that unknown, leads to better maps than simply trying to overlay prior maps on that which is new.</p><p class="p1">(There's a lot more to George Simon's work than that, and what I've written elides a lot, but that should suffice in the current context!)</p><p class="p2">Some years later, University of Chicago psychologist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Gendlin" target="_blank">Eugene Gendlin</a>&nbsp;described a similar process in his book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Focusing-Eugene-T-Gendlin/dp/0553278339" target="_blank">Focusing</a></em>.&nbsp;</p><p class="p1">Lest this seem like mystical mumbo-jumbo, let me end with a wonderful quote from Richard Feynman's autobiography, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Surely-Feynman-Adventures-Curious-Character/dp/0393316041" target="_blank">Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman</a></em>.&nbsp;Both as a student and as a professor, Feynman was fond of playing jokes on people by presenting mathematical or physical laws in unexpected contexts, and finding that his listeners didn't recognize them, and were completely puzzled. They'd learned the symbols (the maps), but just couldn't relate them back to the underlying reality sufficiently to see them in real life.</p><p class="p1">&quot;I don't know what's the matter with people: they don't learn by understanding; they learn by some other way -- by rote, or something,&quot; he wrote.&nbsp;&quot;Their knowledge is so fragile!&quot;&nbsp;</p><p class="p2">It's precisely this training in how to look at the world directly, not simply to reshuffle the maps, that is at the heart of original work in science.</p><p class="p2">And in a business context, it was this training that allowed me to play a major role in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Mb8kQf0SNv0C&lpg=PA38&ots=InxjMiuSP1&dq=remaking%20the%20peer%20to%20peer%20meme&pg=PA41#v=onepage&q=remaking%20the%20peer%20to%20peer%20meme&f=false" target="_blank">popularizing the notion of open source software</a>&nbsp;by noticing that the narrative about free software put forward by Richard Stallman and Eric Raymond ignored the most successful free software of all, the free software that underlies the internet, or to <a href="http://oreilly.com/web2/archive/what-is-web-20.html" target="_blank">define &quot;Web 2.0&quot;</a>&nbsp;by extrapolating from the differences between the companies that failed in the dotcom bust from those that survived that there would be a shift in economic power from proprietary software to proprietary data, and to presage today's world of big data and collective intelligence.</p><p class="p1">The key, though, is to remember that this is an experiential practice. Recognizing when you're stuck in the words, looking at the map rather than the road, is something that is surprisingly hard to learn.</p><p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>

I think I'm being discriminated against because of my age.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLooking back, it's easy to see where they went wrong...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs the saying goes, &quot;hindsight is 20/20&quot; \u002d and for these folks, it's not hard to see where they went off\u002dcourse in their career journey. The sad part is, they were doing what they were told to do: make peace with your career and take care of the other areas of your life. Sounds like good advice, but in reality, not focusing on the career that gives you financial security and a sense of identity can come back to haunt you. Especially these days, when the average length of a job assignment is two years and changing jobs frequently is the 'new normal' in career development.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDon't want this to be your future?

We justify it by saying, &quot;I've worked hard to get where I am, I can take the gas of the pedal for a bit.&quot; But in reality, you can never, ever stop learning and growing in your career. The moment you chose to slow down, you are putting yourself in a category of people who are seen as on the down\u002dtrend in their careers. Employers hire rising stars, not falling ones.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2) Figure out your specialty.\u003c/strong\u003e As we get seasoned in our careers, employers expect us to bring more value in the form of a specialty. We are the aspirin to their pain. The more we can prove we will alleviate their bigger headaches, the more they'll pay. Job security is about building up an expertise that is in\u002ddemand. It's up to us to follow the emerging trends in our field and to build up our skills so they can help employers solve the pressing problems they face. There's nothing worse than waking up one day and realizing your skills aren't valuable to an employer. Your earning potential immediately plummets \u002d as does your job security.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3) Network consistently.\u003c/strong\u003e As we move along in our careers, it's easy to say, \u003cem\u003e&quot;I have enough professional contacts, I don't need any more.&quot;\u003c/em\u003e This couldn't be more wrong. Just ask anyone who has tried to get references from retired managers or companies that are out of business. Your network ages out of the marketplace if you don't focus on acquiring new contacts to backfill the ones that fall out. That means reaching out to people your age or YOUNGER, to build partnerships and stay connected in the industry. Not to mention, it helps you to stay up\u002dto\u002ddate on the latest trends and can instill you with the youthful energy and excitement for your industry that may have long since left you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBlaming employers won't help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI'm sure some of you reading this feel employers should take responsibility for all the older workers they laid\u002doff and are no longer looking to hire. I often get asked, &quot;Where's the loyalty?&quot; However, neither you nor I can change the way business is going right now. The fact is, employers are no longer offering full\u002dtime long\u002dterm employment to anybody. They rate of change in business today makes it impossible for them to make that of employment promise.

Employers want to know you are back on track. There's an entire branding process you should go through (which I will discuss in a future post), in order to get hiring managers to consider you. Do that first, and then you can focus on re\u002dbuilding the career trajectory.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you made these career mistakes, it's not too late.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you can recognize and accept what's happened, you can make changes and get back in the game.
