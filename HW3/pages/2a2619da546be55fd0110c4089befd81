So how did Zephyr, who was not one of those decision-makers, have such an impact? I’ll try to answer that question and offer some observations her campaign and what it meant. My first stab at the question was back in July, in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.salon.com/2014/07/19/the_most_important_money_in_politics_race_this_year_why_lefty_tea_party_may_be_here/" data-href="http://www.salon.com/2014/07/19/the_most_important_money_in_politics_race_this_year_why_lefty_tea_party_may_be_here/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">this Salon piece</a>.</p><p name="156e" class="graf--p"><a id="156e"></a>Here are some more thoughts, now that the primary is over. First, here are 5 reasons Cuomo won this primary (though he won it with a shockingly low percentage of the vote, roughly 20 points less than Spitzer got in his primary for Governor in 2006).</p><ol class="postList"><li name="1b8a" class="graf--li"><a id="1b8a"></a><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Cuomo “won” because he spent more than $11 million on TV alone while Zephyr Teachout spent $500,000 on the whole campaign. </strong>Cuomo won for one reason — his opponent had no name ID, and he spent between $11M and $15M on this election. Money in politics is used to talk to voters through mail and TV. Without it, you are mute. Zephr Teachout didn’t do one piece of mail, or a single TV ad. There was a lot of evidence that primary voters, when given a light persuasion message, flipped to Teachout. She got a big chunk of the vote without spending very much at all. But there was no money to deliver such a message. Given a bit more money, or a bit more time, the outcome would have been different. To put it another way, Cuomo paid roughly $48 for every vote he got, where Zephyr paid roughly $2.70 (UPDATE: Philip Bump has <a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/09/10/andrew-cuomo-spent-almost-40-times-as-much-for-his-votes-as-zephyr-teachout/" data-href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/09/10/andrew-cuomo-spent-almost-40-times-as-much-for-his-votes-as-zephyr-teachout/" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="nofollow">a more accurate count, and calculated that </a>it’s $60.62 for Cuomo to $1.57 for Zephyr, though all the data isn’t in yet). That’s a very big differential, in terms of the power of the messaging. If Zephyr had had a bit more money, she could have easily won.</li><li name="7f7c" class="graf--li"><a id="7f7c"></a><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">The liberal establishment went for Cuomo. </strong>Aside from money, Cuomo had the machinery of elections on his side.

And so on.</li><li name="51cd" class="graf--li"><a id="51cd"></a><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">The Occupy bloc isn’t enough, but it matters. </strong>Zephyr’s base bloc isn’t enough to win a primary, but it is part of a potential coalition that could do so. It’s the Occupy voter bloc, perhaps what Howard Dean had from 2002–2004 but infused with an economic justice frame. It is the only organized voting group that is able to sit outside the political establishment. They were willing to back a neophyte female candidate with no money and no establishment support against the marriage equality guy with $35 million in the bank who balanced the state budget four years in a row. It’s not a complete coalition, but it is a piece of a broader coalition.</li><li name="be2b" class="graf--li"><a id="be2b"></a><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Andrew Cuomo will be Governor, but his career is over. </strong>Cuomo will win in November. He will govern for another four years, or until he is indicted. But he will not hold another elected office, because he has proven himself a very good machine boss but a very bad candidate. The level of petty vindictiveness reflects a brilliant man who simply cannot help himself but indulge his desire for control. Interestingly, Zephyr won Albany County, and people there know him best.</li><li name="a590" class="graf--li"><a id="a590"></a><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">The New York establishment hates and fears Andrew Cuomo. </strong>Zephyr Teachout is a great candidate, and she ran an excellent campaign. But Cuomo had a lot of enemies, and her campaign gave them all a chance to vent. It was like a dam broke, and every anti-Cuomo sentiment poured through the wreckage. I saw this up close as a volunteer for Zephyr; a surprising number of people at her rallies had had close experiences with Cuomo, and hated him for his micro-managing style and general petty vindictiveness. I heard from former state employees who complained of his staffs’ screaming and stapler throwing, librarians angry that Cuomo was selling public libraries to be bulldozed for luxury condos, and even the representative of an ultra-conservative wealthy plutocrat who said his boss hated Cuomo because “he is a fucking liar.” But that said, while hating him, they went along with him. For instance, New York politician Ed Koch still wouldn’t forgive Cuomo for a campaign stunt from 1977: “<em class="markup--em markup--li-em">During the ugly 1977 New York City mayoral primary battle between Koch and Mario Cuomo, Cuomo campaign signs appeared throughout Queens — Cuomo’s home turf — reading, “Vote for Cuomo, Not the Homo.” Cuomo’s son Andrew, then 19, worked alongside his father on the campaign.” </em>That didn’t stop Koch from cutting Cuomo a check for $1000 in 2010. (Koch passed away in 2013). Now that Cuomo’s control of the party is in question, his ability to govern will be dramatically weakened. He will be Governor, but no longer King.</li></ol><p name="9147" class="graf--p"><a id="9147"></a>Then there’s the flip side of the coin. What was this Zephyr Teachout thing all about?</p><ol class="postList"><li name="d79d" class="graf--li"><a id="d79d"></a><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Zephyr Teachout’s career is just beginning. </strong>Teachout is a star. The New York establishment ignored her at first, but was utterly charmed by her by the end of the campaign. She’s got a book coming out on political corruption, a good platform from Fordham Law School, a deep network of connections, a political base, and and the clear chops to be an excellent candidate at any level. Her campaign, led by the brilliant former WFP operative Mike Boland, suggests she has the ability to pull together an effective political operation. She is a star, if not a governor. That’s powerful. She needs a platform, but she will find one.</li><li name="9f98" class="graf--li"><a id="9f98"></a><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">This was a real debate of ideas. </strong>This was the most interesting election I’ve seen since 2006, when Ned Lamont challenged Joe Lieberman for the Senate seat. Lamont defeated Lieberman in the primary, but lost in the general election. That year, the Presidential candidates — Hillary Clinton, John Edwards, and Barack Obama — saw that the anti-Bush left that had emerged in the wake of the Iraq war to challenge the pro-war hawks was not dominant in the party, and resolved to crush it. They did.

This election, in 2014, is the first signal that there’s real dissent within the party, over big stuff. While the core disagreements incorporate economic justice as well as national security, it’s not a coincidence that Zephyr Teachout was the internet director of Howard Dean’s campaign in 2003–2004.</li><li name="f591" class="graf--li"><a id="f591"></a><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">The Occupy bloc has emerged. </strong>Zephyr drew her strongest — but not only — support from white liberals from the ages of 30–45 years. This is the Occupy Wall Street demographic. It is teachers, librarians, fracktivists, techies, and publishers. It is also heavily networked and organized. Some Cuomo insiders were making fun of the fact that Teachout couldn’t draw big crowds, while Cuomo could. But this is because Cuomo’s machine organizes constituencies in union halls, whereas Teachout’s are on listservs and on Twitter. It’s just a different frame of reference, union organizers organize at union halls, fracktivists organize on listservs.</li><li name="8819" class="graf--li"><a id="8819"></a><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Antitrust is an extremely potent issue. </strong>Zephyr Teachout consistently drew her biggest applause line with “It’s time for some good old fashioned trust-busting.” She made a point of saying that big cable is too big, and that Amazon is a threat to open markets. Zephyr often said she is an old school Democrat. What she meant is not just that she backs more funding for schools, but that she believes in a redesigned relationship between powerful private actors and the state similar to the one implemented by FDR. This is first and foremost about a strong an antitrust agenda. Much of this can be traced to scholar Barry Lynn at the New America Foundation’s <a target="_blank" href="http://markets.newamerica.net/" data-href="http://markets.newamerica.net/" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="nofollow">Open Markets Program</a>, where Teachout was recently <a target="_blank" href="http://newamerica.net/user/616" data-href="http://newamerica.net/user/616" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="nofollow">a fellow</a>. An intellectual foundation rooted in a robust historical outlook has given Teachout the means to become a star, and this foundation rests on trust-busting in the private sphere and anti-corruption in the public sphere.</li><li name="fbb0" class="graf--li"><a id="fbb0"></a><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Bill De Blasio is gunning for the Governorship, and then the Presidency. </strong>De Blasio played a key role in bringing down Zephyr, but also exposing what is different from his Clintonian progressive ideology and Zephyr’s intellectual tradition. De Blasio is not a throwback Democrat, he’s a slightly more left-wing version of Bill Clinton or Barack Obama. His policy choices, such as Pre-K, paid sick leave, but continued Muslim surveillance and stock and frisk as well as coordination with large banks and real estate interest, are classic New Democrat moves.

If the tech community starts to put serious money into anti-corruption politics, that would be interesting.

Zephr Teachout didn’t do one piece of mail, or a single TV ad. There was a lot of evidence that primary voters, when given a light persuasion message, flipped to Teachout. She got a big chunk of the vote without spending very much at all. But there was no money to deliver such a message. Given a bit more money, or a bit more time, the outcome would have been different. To put it another way, Cuomo paid roughly $48 for every vote he got, where Zephyr paid roughly $2.70 (UPDATE: Philip Bump has a more accurate count, and calculated that it’s $60.62 for Cuomo to $1.57 for Zephyr, though all the data isn’t in yet).

I heard from former state employees who complained of his staffs’ screaming and stapler throwing, librarians angry that Cuomo was selling public libraries to be bulldozed for luxury condos, and even the representative of an ultra-conservative wealthy plutocrat who said his boss hated Cuomo because “he is a fucking liar.” But that said, while hating him, they went along with him. For instance, New York politician Ed Koch still wouldn’t forgive Cuomo for a campaign stunt from 1977: “During the ugly 1977 New York City mayoral primary battle between Koch and Mario Cuomo, Cuomo campaign signs appeared throughout Queens — Cuomo’s home turf — reading, “Vote for Cuomo, Not the Homo.” Cuomo’s son Andrew, then 19, worked alongside his father on the campaign.” That didn’t stop Koch from cutting Cuomo a check for $1000 in 2010.

Governor (which Zephyr nearly, but did not, receive).","markups":[{"type":1,"start":0,"end":6}]},{"name":"4898","type":1,"text":"Micah Sifry and Andrew Rasiej of Personal Democracy Forum are organizers of New York tech politics. They wrote this broad letter to Cuomo in 2012, and a lot of important venture capitalists signed it. It was a request for public financing of campaigns. Many of those people backed Teachout/Wu, as well as Larry Lessig’s Mayday PAC. If the tech community starts to put serious money into anti-corruption politics, that would be interesting. We’re already seeing engagement on public financing and net neutrality, but traditionally VCs have also been interested in antitrust because their startups are crushed by monopolists. There are of course cross-pressures here.","markups":[{"type":3,"start":111,"end":145,"href":"http://fairelectionsny.org/old/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/20121115TechLettertoCuomo.pdf","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0}]},{"name":"5d81","type":1,"text":"Micah wrote: What I find most intriguing about this is the way some tech VCs and entrepreneurs really seem to understand their success as tied to (or born up from) the open Internet and how we may link that to open politics or open democracy (defined as a system where the little guy can enter and compete on an open playing field, rather than one dominated by political and economic monopolists and duopolists).

She won over 20 counties outside of New York City, and this is largely due to her stance on fracking, as well as the really bad rural economy that results from neoliberal urban focused financial politics. Cuomo has tried to assuage this with lots of tax credits and development deals, but, according to Hunter College professor Ken Sherrill, “it seems like all that vaunted economic development hasn’t reached the average voter.” That’s true. It’s pretty much common sense — you don’t do tech startups in cow country, you make dairy profitable. Also, Zephyr, though portrayed as a big city professor from New York, grew up on a farm in rural Vermont. Upstate farmers are actually her people. Here are counties she won (or nearly won). There’s a great map of the regional breakdown at the New York Times site.","markups":[{"type":3,"start":98,"end":134,"href":"http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/09/10/liberal-teachout-won-over-democrats-in-new-yorks-conservative-heartland/","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0},{"type":3,"start":830,"end":866,"href":"http://elections.nytimes.com/2014/results/primaries/new-york-state","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0}]},{"name":"0770","type":1,"text":"• Putnam- 53.5% • Dutchess- 57.5% • Ulster- 70.0% • Sullivan- 67.6% • Delaware- 63.3% • Greene- 62.1% • Columbia- 77.9% • Rensselaer- 63.4% • Albany- 61.9% • Schoharie- 71.7% • Washington- 63.8% • Saratoga- 67.3% • Fulton- 54.3% • Montgomery- 54.5% • Otsego- 72.7% • Chenango- 49.9% • Madison- 46.8% • Cortland- 60.6% • Tompkins- 70.9% • Tioga- 49.7% • Schuyler- 60.7% • Yates- 61.5% • Ontario- 50.8% • Seneca- 56.3% • Wayne- 49.1% • Warren- 56.7% • Hamilton- 51.7% • Essex- 48.6% • Clinton- 49.4% • St Lawrence- 54.6%","markups":[]},{"name":"69d7","type":1,"text":"And the third observation is that the Progressive Change Campaign Committee really mattered.
