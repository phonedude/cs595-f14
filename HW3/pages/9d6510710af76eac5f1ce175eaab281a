The term crime does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law (i.e. something is a crime if applicable law says that it is). One proposed definition is that a <b>crime<\/b>, also called an <b>offence<\/b> or a <b>criminal offence<\/b>, is an act harmful not only to some individual, but also to the community or the state (a public wrong). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\n<p>The idea that acts like murder, rape and theft are prohibited exists all around the world. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. Therefore, in modern societies, a criminal procedure must be adhered to during the investigation and trial. Only if found guilty, the offender may be sentenced to punishment such as community sentence, imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, even death.<\/p>\n<p>To be classified as a crime, the act of doing something bad (actus reus) must be usually accompanied by the intention to do something bad (mens rea), with certain exceptions (strict liability).<\/p>\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime. Breaches of private law (torts and breaches of contract) are not automatically punished by the state, but can be enforced through civil procedure.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","id":1,"wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crime","active":true,"local_url":"\/topic\/crime-courts\/","kind":"vertical","woeid":null,"category":"Topic","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1","moderation_status":"approved","name":"crime & courts","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crime\">Wikipedia<\/a>","created_on":"2012-11-28T17:18:53","latitude":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/crime-courts\/"}],"url_domain":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2014\/06\/11\/troutdale-ore-police-say-they-are-not-aware-of"},{"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/396228\/","type":"text","push_content":"Oregon high school shooter had AR-15, semi-automatic handgun, 9 loaded magazines with several hundred rounds -

It has been produced in many different versions, including numerous semi-automatic and selective fire variants. It is manufactured with extensive use of aluminum alloys and synthetic materials.<\/p>\n<p>The AR-15 was first built by ArmaLite as a small arms rifle for the United States armed forces. Because of financial problems, ArmaLite sold the AR-15 design to Colt. After modifications (most notably the relocation of the charging handle from under the carrying handle like the AR-10 to the rear of the receiver), the new redesigned rifle was subsequently adopted as the M16 rifle. Colt then started selling the semi-automatic version of the M16 rifle as the Colt AR-15 for civilian sales in 1963 and the term has been used to refer to semiautomatic-only versions of the rifle since then. Although the name \"AR-15\" remains a Colt registered trademark, variants of the firearm are independently made, modified and sold under various names by multiple manufacturers.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","id":5303,"wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/AR-15","active":true,"local_url":"\/topic\/ar-15\/","kind":"tag","woeid":null,"category":"Product","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=5303","moderation_status":"approved","name":"AR-15","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/AR-15\">Wikipedia<\/a>","created_on":"2012-12-16T20:54:45","latitude":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/ar-15\/"},{"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1\/","twitter_username":null,"placetype":"","recent_count":10,"facebookchat":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1","links":"","slug":"crime-courts","longitude":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/4\/4b\/Pierre-Paul_Prud%27hon_-_Justice_and_Divine_Vengeance_Pursuing_Crime.JPG","item_count":43589,"muted_by_default":false,"daily_count":30,"livevideo":"","latest_item_date":"2014-09-29T03:26:47.882316","geohash":"","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/B","description":"<p>In ordinary language, the term <b>crime<\/b> denotes an unlawful act punishable by a state.

It is bordered on its west by the Pacific Ocean, north by Washington, south by California, east by Idaho, and southeast by Nevada. The Columbia River delineates much of Oregon's northern boundary, the Snake River largely its eastern.<\/p>\n<p>Oregon's area was inhabited by many indigenous tribes before traders, explorers, and settlers arrived. An autonomous government was formed in Oregon Country in 1843, Oregon Territory was created in 1848, and Oregon became the 33rd state on February 14, 1859.<\/p>\n<p>It is the 9th largest and 27th most populous state. Its capital is Salem, third most populous of its cities. With 603,106 (2012 estimate) residents Portland ranks 1st in Oregon, and 28th in the U.S. Its metro population of 2,262,605 (2011 estimate) is 23rd. The Willamette River Valley in western Oregon is the state's most densely populated area, home to eight of the ten most populous cities.<\/p>\n<p>Oregon's landscape is diverse, with a windswept Pacific coastline, volcano studded Cascade Mountains, abundant waterfalls, dense evergreen forests, mixed forests, and deciduous forests at lower elevations, and high desert sprawling across much of its east all the way to the Great Basin. The tall Douglas firs and redwoods along its rainy west coast contrast with the lighter timbered and fire-prone pine and juniper forests covering portions to the east. Abundant alders in the west fix nitrogen for the conifers; aspen groves are common in the east. Stretching east from central Oregon are semi-arid shrublands, prairies, deserts, steppes, and meadows. At 11,249 feet (3,429 m) Mount Hood is the state high point, Crater Lake National Park its only national park.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","id":943,"wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Oregon","active":true,"local_url":"\/topic\/oregon-us\/","kind":"location","woeid":2347596,"category":"State","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=943","moderation_status":"approved","name":"Oregon, US","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Oregon\">Wikipedia<\/a>","created_on":"2010-06-12T23:35:11","latitude":44.1156,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/oregon-us\/"},{"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/68673\/","twitter_username":null,"placetype":"POI","recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=68673","links":"","slug":"reynolds-high-school-troutdale-or-us","longitude":-122.4,"image_url":"","item_count":34,"muted_by_default":false,"daily_count":0,"livevideo":"","latest_item_date":"2014-06-11T19:21:35.376958","geohash":"","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/R1n","description":"","id":68673,"wikipedia_url":"","active":true,"local_url":"\/topic\/reynolds-high-school-troutdale-or-us\/","kind":"location","woeid":23637241,"category":"POI","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=68673","moderation_status":"approved","name":"Reynolds High School, Troutdale, OR, US","image_credit":"","created_on":"2014-06-10T15:22:12.552224","latitude":45.5299,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/reynolds-high-school-troutdale-or-us\/"},{"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/68674\/","twitter_username":null,"placetype":"Town","recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=68674","links":"","slug":"troutdale-or-us","longitude":-122.394,"image_url":"","item_count":36,"muted_by_default":false,"daily_count":0,"livevideo":"","latest_item_date":"2014-07-20T22:44:46.375071","geohash":"","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/R1o","description":"","id":68674,"wikipedia_url":"","active":true,"local_url":"\/topic\/troutdale-or-us\/","kind":"location","woeid":2508156,"category":"Town","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=68674","moderation_status":"approved","name":"Troutdale, OR, US","image_credit":"","created_on":"2014-06-10T15:22:27.358372","latitude":45.5343,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/troutdale-or-us\/"},{"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1\/","twitter_username":null,"placetype":"","recent_count":10,"facebookchat":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1","links":"","slug":"crime-courts","longitude":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/4\/4b\/Pierre-Paul_Prud%27hon_-_Justice_and_Divine_Vengeance_Pursuing_Crime.JPG","item_count":43589,"muted_by_default":false,"daily_count":30,"livevideo":"","latest_item_date":"2014-09-29T03:26:47.882316","geohash":"","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/B","description":"<p>In ordinary language, the term <b>crime<\/b> denotes an unlawful act punishable by a state.

More narrowly, it refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance — organized control over a human community, particularly a state. Furthermore, politics is the study or practice of the distribution of power and resources within a given community (a hierarchically organized population) as well as the interrelationship(s) between communities. A variety of methods are employed in politics, which include promoting one's own political views among people, negotiation with other political subjects, making laws, and exercising force, including warfare against adversaries. Politics is exercised on a wide range of social levels, from clans and tribes of traditional societies, through modern local governments, companies and institutions up to sovereign states, to the international level.<\/p>\n<p>A political system is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a given society. History of political thought can be traced back to early antiquity, with seminal works such as Plato's <i>Republic<\/i>, Aristotle's <i>Politics<\/i> and the works of Confucius.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","id":2,"wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Politics","active":true,"local_url":"\/topic\/politics\/","kind":"vertical","woeid":null,"category":"Topic","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=2","moderation_status":"approved","name":"politics","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Politics\">Wikipedia<\/a>","created_on":"2012-10-23T22:09:19","latitude":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/politics\/"}],"url_domain":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2014\/06\/10\/rep-earl-blumenauer-d-ore-leads-us-house-in-mo"},{"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/395800\/","type":"text","push_content":"Troutdale, Ore., police say weapon used in high school shooting was a rifle -

It is bordered on its west by the Pacific Ocean, north by Washington, south by California, east by Idaho, and southeast by Nevada. The Columbia River delineates much of Oregon's northern boundary, the Snake River largely its eastern.<\/p>\n<p>Oregon's area was inhabited by many indigenous tribes before traders, explorers, and settlers arrived. An autonomous government was formed in Oregon Country in 1843, Oregon Territory was created in 1848, and Oregon became the 33rd state on February 14, 1859.<\/p>\n<p>It is the 9th largest and 27th most populous state. Its capital is Salem, third most populous of its cities. With 603,106 (2012 estimate) residents Portland ranks 1st in Oregon, and 28th in the U.S. Its metro population of 2,262,605 (2011 estimate) is 23rd. The Willamette River Valley in western Oregon is the state's most densely populated area, home to eight of the ten most populous cities.<\/p>\n<p>Oregon's landscape is diverse, with a windswept Pacific coastline, volcano studded Cascade Mountains, abundant waterfalls, dense evergreen forests, mixed forests, and deciduous forests at lower elevations, and high desert sprawling across much of its east all the way to the Great Basin. The tall Douglas firs and redwoods along its rainy west coast contrast with the lighter timbered and fire-prone pine and juniper forests covering portions to the east. Abundant alders in the west fix nitrogen for the conifers; aspen groves are common in the east. Stretching east from central Oregon are semi-arid shrublands, prairies, deserts, steppes, and meadows. At 11,249 feet (3,429 m) Mount Hood is the state high point, Crater Lake National Park its only national park.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","id":943,"wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Oregon","active":true,"local_url":"\/topic\/oregon-us\/","kind":"location","woeid":2347596,"category":"State","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=943","moderation_status":"approved","name":"Oregon, US","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Oregon\">Wikipedia<\/a>","created_on":"2010-06-12T23:35:11","latitude":44.1156,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/oregon-us\/"},{"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/68673\/","twitter_username":null,"placetype":"POI","recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=68673","links":"","slug":"reynolds-high-school-troutdale-or-us","longitude":-122.4,"image_url":"","item_count":34,"muted_by_default":false,"daily_count":0,"livevideo":"","latest_item_date":"2014-06-11T19:21:35.376958","geohash":"","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/R1n","description":"","id":68673,"wikipedia_url":"","active":true,"local_url":"\/topic\/reynolds-high-school-troutdale-or-us\/","kind":"location","woeid":23637241,"category":"POI","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=68673","moderation_status":"approved","name":"Reynolds High School, Troutdale, OR, US","image_credit":"","created_on":"2014-06-10T15:22:12.552224","latitude":45.5299,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/reynolds-high-school-troutdale-or-us\/"},{"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/68674\/","twitter_username":null,"placetype":"Town","recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=68674","links":"","slug":"troutdale-or-us","longitude":-122.394,"image_url":"","item_count":36,"muted_by_default":false,"daily_count":0,"livevideo":"","latest_item_date":"2014-07-20T22:44:46.375071","geohash":"","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/R1o","description":"","id":68674,"wikipedia_url":"","active":true,"local_url":"\/topic\/troutdale-or-us\/","kind":"location","woeid":2508156,"category":"Town","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=68674","moderation_status":"approved","name":"Troutdale, OR, US","image_credit":"","created_on":"2014-06-10T15:22:27.358372","latitude":45.5343,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/troutdale-or-us\/"},{"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/4393\/","twitter_username":null,"placetype":"","recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=4393","links":"","slug":"john-kitzhaber","longitude":null,"image_url":"","item_count":13,"muted_by_default":false,"daily_count":0,"livevideo":"","latest_item_date":"2014-07-17T00:27:35.599446","geohash":"","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BI1","description":"","id":4393,"wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/John_Kitzhaber","active":true,"local_url":"\/topic\/john-kitzhaber\/","kind":"tag","woeid":null,"category":"Person","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=4393","moderation_status":"approved","name":"John Kitzhaber","image_credit":"","created_on":"2010-11-04T02:21:34","latitude":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/john-kitzhaber\/"},{"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1\/","twitter_username":null,"placetype":"","recent_count":10,"facebookchat":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1","links":"","slug":"crime-courts","longitude":null,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/4\/4b\/Pierre-Paul_Prud%27hon_-_Justice_and_Divine_Vengeance_Pursuing_Crime.JPG","item_count":43589,"muted_by_default":false,"daily_count":30,"livevideo":"","latest_item_date":"2014-09-29T03:26:47.882316","geohash":"","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/B","description":"<p>In ordinary language, the term <b>crime<\/b> denotes an unlawful act punishable by a state.

Furthermore, politics is the study or practice of the distribution of power and resources within a given community (a hierarchically organized population) as well as the interrelationship(s) between communities. A variety of methods are employed in politics, which include promoting one's own political views among people, negotiation with other political subjects, making laws, and exercising force, including warfare against adversaries. Politics is exercised on a wide range of social levels, from clans and tribes of traditional societies, through modern local governments, companies and institutions up to sovereign states, to the international level.<\/p>\n<p>A political system is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a given society.
