Also, I've read the entire study, and long admired Pew's Lee Rainey (he's a friend), and there's as much positive here as &quot;look at all the risks.&quot;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMore broadly, there is something in our wiring I've been spending time thinking and reading about: that when something new comes out we tend to instantly deconstruct all the things that can go wrong without asking the concurrent and important question, &quot;what might be different?&quot;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI remember Warren Buffett once noting that in 1898 some innovation came out that would increase dramatically the number of horses people in America would require, and almost instantly there were university studies about how by 1936 the entire US would be covered in 7 inches of horse shit. Among other things no one asked, &quot;but what if there was an alternative to the horse?&quot;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThus when Airbnb and Uber were launched, instantly the doubters were out saying &quot;rape and abuse will be rampant&quot; without stopping to think that with instant GPS, community comments/rankings and bank account information bad actors would be more catchable and preventable than in any cab or hotel room. Not all, but most technological advances I can think of over my lifetime, had the same initial reactions \u002d\u002d not least of which the Internet overall (and now look at what people are saying about bitcoin, which could empower the entire emerging world with safe access to &quot;cash&quot; and transactions.

I have had to check myself throughout my life on this and, as a former history major in my early days with technology, kept looking for precedent to explain why things would or would not work. Deadly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course, as with every technological advancement, there will be both specifically bad things and surprising unintended consequences. I love the line in the great play, &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot; \u002d\u002d itself about the unsettlement that comes with changes in science:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eProgress has never been a bargain. You have to pay for it. Sometimes I think there's a man who sits behind a counter and says, &quot;All right, you can have a telephone but you lose privacy and the charm of distance. Madam, you may vote but at a price. You lose the right to retreat behind the powder puff or your petticoat. Mister, you may conquer the air but the birds will lose their wonder and the clouds will smell of gasoline.&quot;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eI worry most about something else in human nature \u002d\u002d a combination of two things really \u002d\u002d which I do believe technology compounds: that we gravitate to our own self\u002dconfirming echo chambers and do not sustain interest in issues long enough to hold power in check. We tweet about &quot;bring back our girls&quot; and two weeks later no one talks about them. We move on. Bad actors thrive on people losing interest and fear demands that don't go away.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI am not a fan of Snowden for all the obvious reasons, but I do believe he pushed a dialogue about the trade offs between how much security and how much privacy are we willing to swallow. We simply never had that dialogue before him. It will be interesting to see how big an issue this debate will be in this Presidential election or in other organized communities.

Much has been made of recent Supreme Court decisions creating a free\u002dfor\u002dall for political campaign contributions. While this does make me uneasy, I have often wondered if the data is clear that rich people can convince voters to act against their interests. It seems to under\u002destimate the intelligence of the American people, who in my experience generally possess some impressive horse sense.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat this chart shows, however, is that it is in governance, not in politics, where money plays a dangerous role often behind the scenes in the obfuscation, 1000\u002dpage bills and cumbersome legal regulations most of us never hear about or barely understand when we do. There may be some reasonable arguments worthy of debate around net neutrality. Will, for example, the pipe companies hesitate to put the billions of dollars required in ensuring our globally leading\u002dedge wired and/or wireless broadband infrastructure? Will they be fearful that net neutrality will encumber their ability to make a return on these investments?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI doubt if frankly. If these institutions spent half the time they do lobbying on creating an outstanding customer service, maybe they wouldn't have to fear, as one senior cable exec recently said to me, &quot;being just a utility and dumb pipe.&quot; Come join 2014 and create an on\u002ddemand system with a decent library and user interface that even resembled the ease Netflix and stop making me schedule customer service calls between the hours of 1:00 and 7:00 pm without an apology for even then being two hours late and I may listen better.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd forgive me if I'm suspect that greater rents taken from us or content providers is a predictor of flourishing innovation. Ask any mobile app developer what is was like for them when they tried to deploy an app prior to the iPhone &amp; Apple app store in those care\u002dfree days of near cable monopoly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut the central point is that these are discussions to be had openly, clearly and with transparency, not quietly disassembled in the corridors of Washington where the best lobbyists with the most money wins. Where they quietly and deliberately overturn previous rulings hoping the rest of won't notice.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn SOPA, people noticed. On Net Neutrality they are noticing, and they are demanding an equal say.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI don't single out the carriers.

Contributor Will Greene on how tech is taking root in the Philippines today is a \u003ca href=\"http://shar.es/BX88f\" target=\"_blank\"\u003egreat example\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlso today there was an announcement from a very different Middle East then we in the States are used to hearing about on CNN. souq.com \u002d\u002d the largest eCommerce player in the region \u002d\u002d just raised $75 mm from the South African investors Naspers at a \u003ca href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/03/24/souq\u002dcom\u002ddubai\u002dbased\u002de\u002dcommerce\u002dsite\u002draises\u002d75\u002dmln/?mod=ST1 \" target=\"_blank\"\u003ereported valuation exceeding $500 \u003c/a\u003emm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is huge, counter\u002dnarrative and a lens to how emerging growth markets are in the early days of changing the global tech landscape. David was impressed, but asked: Why does it take a South African company to recognize a company like this? When will mainstream tech investors in the States become more internationally\u002dminded, especially to open their minds about the Middle East?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI responded that some have long noticed. General Atlantic (out of their London operations) understands this. Tiger Global (who invested in Maktoob, the Yahoo! of the Middle East bought by Yahoo! and subsequently spun out souq.com) puts their money where their mouths are. Operating tech companies (Google, Microsoft, Intel, Vodafone, Cisco, PayPal, Linkedin, FB, Twitter) understand it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut western (US in particular) VC's are slow. In part this is because the best of the US investors see the best US deals \u002d\u002d and our ecosystem, our rule of law, the network effect of talent that is Silicon Valley and other places here attract dollars accordingly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, our internally focused friends also have not quite all figured out how to engage in a coming world of 5 billion smart phones \u002d\u002d where literally billions of people will have super computing on their person in corners of the world we have all but ignored.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eToo many western VCs are of the mind set still of: we'll go where there is big market cap (&quot;may lose money in china, but got to be there&quot;); or where we can outsource cheaply. They will have their offices in Israel, China, Brazil, India perhaps, but also believe if they find world class entrepreneurs they are likely also willing to move here.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut they are missing how the world is shifting when there is ubiquitous access to the very software they helped invent! Great entrepreneurs want to stay home and now more than ever can. And market opportunities are springing up around them at scale.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo make it globally in tech, it used to be like the World Series in baseball \u002d\u002d all about making it in the US. This is changing. I see companies now in the Middle East and elsewhere that will make a fortune not thinking about the US as a market because their other markets are so big. Souq.com is all about their region, then Africa perhaps. I doubt Baidu or Tencent in China, or Yandex in Russia, or Mercado Libre in Brazil and Latin America spend five minutes wondering about whether they need the US to succeed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI'm not saying the US isn't central to the future of innovation, entrepreneurship or venture investing. It will be. I'm not saying these new giants will ignore us.

Everyone is a genius, one can do no wrong. It feels great, but is actually a very dangerous period in an enterprise.

<p><img class="center" src="http://m.c.lnkd.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/p/1/005/078/255/2344892.jpg" alt=""></p><p>I was not shocked utterly last week that Washington Post Iran correspondent, and my friend, Jason Rezaian, his wife Yeganeh Salehi and two other journalists were arrested without charges or explanation.</p><p>He knows that there is not one Iran, that forces looking to the 21st century battle &mdash; as such forces around the world today are battling &mdash; defenders of the status quo. I had assumed, perhaps naively, that they knew supporting people like these four was the surest sign that political leadership is comfortable enough in its own skin to welcome greater transparency.</p><p>I was not shocked, but I am disgusted.</p><p>American raised, always connected to his heritage in Iran, Jason is what is best in outstanding journalism. He combines the smart skepticism to dig further that is required in a great newsperson with a clear and beautiful writing style. And yet, unlike many cynical, even defeatist, reporters I know and have worked with &mdash; he has a wonderful sense of hope and potential. His love of Iran, its history, culture and people is infectious. His understanding of its potential in this new millennia is unmatched. He convinced me, as a businessman and fascinated by generational shifts world wide, that something truly different is rising there.</p><p>I am perhaps one of less than 500 Americans to visit Iran in the last year. In May, I joined a dozen CEOs from the US, Canada and the UK to visit this extraordinary culture touring from Tehran south through Isfahan to Shiraz. Little of what we saw was what we expected. While signs of its police state were clear, we saw a vibrancy and excitement of a society eager to join the 21st century global economy.</p><p>Hope in particular was universally expressed in the new leadership of President Rouhani and his team. They, it was said repeatedly to me, were uniquely committed to navigate fairly a strong sense of tradition and culture while opening the extraordinary and broad talent of this country to innovate and have better lives. Equally universal hope for a thaw in relationships with the United States was clearly less a &quot;turn to the west,&quot; as an opportunity to take their own rightful place in the world. The region, Turkey, Dubai, Asia and Europe are all poised to lock arms with Iran as a perfect cultural and business connector east-west/north-south.</p><p>I reported this trip overall in some detail in the <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/2014/05/what-its-like-being-a-business-traveler-in-iran/ " rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Harvard Business Review</a> and in my particular area of experience &mdash; tech startups around the world &mdash; I was stunned by the potential I saw in Iran's new generation, and described it in <a href="http://pando.com/2014/05/20/startup-rising-iran/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Pando Daily</a>.</p><p>What we in the West miss most in Iran and in many emerging growth markets is this: the new generation under 30 frames the world utterly different than their parents. Raised on technology, seeing daily what is happening around the globe, using tools to share, collaborate and create, they want to take hold of the future. Suspect of regimes who have cracked down on them in the past, they are in fact quite hopeful &mdash; desperately looking for evidence of leadership that is on their sides and they can support.</p><p>We see everywhere &mdash; in Iran, the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and even here in the United States and Europe &mdash; top down institutions showing their disdain for one of the most historic and least understood phenomena in human history: that, bottom up, people have tools and connectedness to solve their own problems and capture and innovate new opportunities. Rather than embracing this power in their resource constrained and often ineffectual &quot;policies,&quot; they fight for the status quo. They fight, of course, for their power in the only way they understand it.</p><p>We sit on the cusp &mdash; for all the pain and uncertainty we see in the news daily &mdash; of an unleashing of societies, especially emerging societies, to create remarkable outcomes.</p><p>For the institutions and leaders that embrace these changes, lead where they can, they can help coauthor results their current paths almost certainly will never achieve.</p><p>Embracing the transparency, openness and innovation being unleashed is a prerequisite.</p><p>Allowing the free flow of people, ideas and thought is a necessity.</p><p>I pray the powers that are sparring now in Iran choose the future. And a good way to signal to all that they mean it is to release Jason and other journalists doing exactly what they should be embracing.</p>

I am not excusing Iran's arrest of journalists, and lack of transparency. What I am saying is that communications technology has created an expectation that change will occur as quick as you can send a tweet. The United States did not automatically become a democracy when it declared its independence. There was a pre\u002ddemocracy incubation period that was at least 150 years long, and a post\u002ddemocracy period that some would argue is still developing. We forget the unique set of conditions that allowed this country to become a relative democracy, the physical isolation from other countries, the sparse native population which allowed quick colonization (at the expense of indian rights and lives), the long period of economic development and prosperity (courtesy of slavery), the development of constitutional rights (courtesy of Sacco and Vanzetti, and the Mccarran\u002dWalter Act), and of course equal opportunity (courtesy of women's sufferage, Roe vs Wade, and the Civil Rights act of 1965). Even with all the above mentioned advantages, our developmental milestones, and national consciousness did not occur overnight.

Each one starts with, &quot;let me tell you my story...&quot; and ends with, &quot;it never used to be this hard to find a job.&quot;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile their stories are intensely personal to them, and heart\u002dbreaking for us to hear, the truth is, they all say roughly the same thing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEvery story goes something like this:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e1) In the early years, I climbed the career ladder, but didn't truly love what I was doing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e2) When I reached a certain point, I had 'golden handcuffs' and decided to just do the job because it paid decently, I was good at it, and I could focus on other areas of my life that needed attention (i.e. family, etc.).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e3) Then suddenly, the market changed, I got laid\u002doff (or fired), and now nobody wants to talk to me. I think I'm being discriminated against because of my age.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLooking back, it's easy to see where they went wrong...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs the saying goes, &quot;hindsight is 20/20&quot; \u002d and for these folks, it's not hard to see where they went off\u002dcourse in their career journey. The sad part is, they were doing what they were told to do: make peace with your career and take care of the other areas of your life. Sounds like good advice, but in reality, not focusing on the career that gives you financial security and a sense of identity can come back to haunt you. Especially these days, when the average length of a job assignment is two years and changing jobs frequently is the 'new normal' in career development.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDon't want this to be your future? Do these \u003cspan class=\"underline\"\u003ethree things\u003c/span\u003e:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor those of you brave enough to read this post, here's what you should do:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1) Don't mentally put the career on hold.\u003c/strong\u003e Life naturally gets busier as we age (i.e. you buy a house, get married, have kids, take care of sick parents, etc.), and that can make us want to put the career on auto\u002dpilot for a bit. We justify it by saying, &quot;I've worked hard to get where I am, I can take the gas of the pedal for a bit.&quot; But in reality, you can never, ever stop learning and growing in your career. The moment you chose to slow down, you are putting yourself in a category of people who are seen as on the down\u002dtrend in their careers. Employers hire rising stars, not falling ones.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2) Figure out your specialty.\u003c/strong\u003e As we get seasoned in our careers, employers expect us to bring more value in the form of a specialty. We are the aspirin to their pain. The more we can prove we will alleviate their bigger headaches, the more they'll pay. Job security is about building up an expertise that is in\u002ddemand. It's up to us to follow the emerging trends in our field and to build up our skills so they can help employers solve the pressing problems they face. There's nothing worse than waking up one day and realizing your skills aren't valuable to an employer. Your earning potential immediately plummets \u002d as does your job security.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3) Network consistently.\u003c/strong\u003e As we move along in our careers, it's easy to say, \u003cem\u003e&quot;I have enough professional contacts, I don't need any more.&quot;\u003c/em\u003e This couldn't be more wrong. Just ask anyone who has tried to get references from retired managers or companies that are out of business. Your network ages out of the marketplace if you don't focus on acquiring new contacts to backfill the ones that fall out. That means reaching out to people your age or YOUNGER, to build partnerships and stay connected in the industry. Not to mention, it helps you to stay up\u002dto\u002ddate on the latest trends and can instill you with the youthful energy and excitement for your industry that may have long since left you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBlaming employers won't help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI'm sure some of you reading this feel employers should take responsibility for all the older workers they laid\u002doff and are no longer looking to hire. I often get asked, &quot;Where's the loyalty?&quot; However, neither you nor I can change the way business is going right now. The fact is, employers are no longer offering full\u002dtime long\u002dterm employment to anybody. They rate of change in business today makes it impossible for them to make that of employment promise.

Employers want to know you are back on track. There's an entire branding process you should go through (which I will discuss in a future post), in order to get hiring managers to consider you. Do that first, and then you can focus on re\u002dbuilding the career trajectory.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you made these career mistakes, it's not too late.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you can recognize and accept what's happened, you can make changes and get back in the game.

You may be intellectually gifted and may have more experience than most of their employees, maybe even the very ones that are conducting the interview. These types of employers are looking to hire someone that will fit right in, not &ldquo;rock the boat&rdquo; with their smart suggestions or challenge the way things are being handled in the organization.

When you get to the part of the interview that tells them how much you are currently making or desire to make, the room gets silent. The employer does not want to tell you that they simply can&rsquo;t afford you. They disguise it by saying you are overqualified when in reality they can&rsquo;t pay you the salary you are asking because it&rsquo;s not in the budget. They were hoping you had all this experience and knowledge and were desperate for the job and were willing to get paid much less than your accomplishments require.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou seem like a know\u002dit\u002dall.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDuring the interview your responses include a lot of factual data.

More often we do this out of nerves or wanting to fit in, or we are simply unaware that we are doing it, but the other person will feel, depending on their character, either disrespected, irritated, angry, insignificant or not valued.
