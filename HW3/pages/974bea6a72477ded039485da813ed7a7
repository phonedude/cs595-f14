<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Afterwords-Letters-Death-Virginia-Woolf/dp/0813535603?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank"><img align="right" style="margin: 9px 0 3px 15px;" src="http://www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/afterwords.jpg" alt="" width="180"/></a>On March 28, 1941, shortly after the devastating dawn of WWII, <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/tag/virginia-woolf">Virginia Woolf</a> filled her overcoat pockets with rocks and walked into the River Ouse behind her house never to emerge alive. A relapse of the all-consuming depression she had narrowly escaped in her youth had finally claimed her life. She left behind a remarkable body of work &#8212; from her <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2014/01/17/virginia-woolf-on-the-joy-of-music-and-dance/">poignant diaries</a> to her <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2013/03/06/virginia-woolf-how-should-one-read-a-book/">magnificent essays</a> to her <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2013/09/10/nurse-lugtons-curtain-virginia-woolf-julie-vivas/">little-known children&#8217;s books</a> to <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2013/10/11/virginia-woolf-orlando-lesbian-readings/">&#8220;the longest and most charming love letter in literature&#8221;</a> &#8212; and a cohort of <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2013/03/28/afterwords-virginia-woolf-condolence-letters/">heartbroken friends</a>, but the most stirring thing she left behind was her suicide letter to her husband Leonard:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Afterwords-Letters-Death-Virginia-Woolf/dp/0813535603?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/virginia_suicide_letter.jpg" alt="" width="500"/></a></p>
<blockquote><p>Dearest,</p>
<p>I feel certain I am going mad again. I feel we can’t go through another of those terrible times. And I shan’t recover this time. I begin to hear voices, and I can’t concentrate. So I am doing what seems the best thing to do. You have given me the greatest possible happiness. You have been in every way all that anyone could be. I don’t think two people could have been happier till this terrible disease came. I can’t fight any longer. I know that I am spoiling your life, that without me you could work. And you will I know. You see I can’t even write this properly. I can’t read. What I want to say is I owe all the happiness of my life to you. You have been entirely patient with me and incredibly good. I want to say that &#8212; everybody knows it. If anybody could have saved me it would have been you. Everything has gone from me but the certainty of your goodness. I can’t go on spoiling your life any longer.</p>
<p>I don’t think two people could have been happier than we have been.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Afterwords-Letters-Death-Virginia-Woolf/dp/0813535603?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/virginialeonardwoolf.jpg" alt="" width="500"/></a></p>
<p>What made the letter especially heartbreaking, however, wasn&#8217;t just that it embodied so excruciatingly <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2014/03/24/the-depths-rottenberg-depression/">modernity&#8217;s tragic epidemic</a> but also that its fate reflected the ugliest aspects of media and journalism. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Afterwords-Letters-Death-Virginia-Woolf/dp/0813535603/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank"><strong><em>Afterwords: Letters on the Death of Virginia Woolf</em></strong></a> (<a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/afterwords-letters-on-the-death-of-virginia-woolf/oclc/55488025&#038;referer=brief_results" target="_blank"><em>public library</em></a>), scholar Sybil Oldfield notes that after Woolf&#8217;s letter was made public, members of the British press took it upon themselves to bestow upon the beloved author a last judgment &#8212; a painfully ungenerous one. On April 27, a month after Woolf&#8217;s death, <em>The Sunday Times</em> ran the following self-righteous evisceration by a Mrs. Kathleen Hicks, wife of the Bishop of Lincoln:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sir, &#8212; I read in your issue of Sunday last that the coroner at the inquest on Mrs. Virginia Woolf said that she was &#8220;undoubtedly much more sensitive than most people to the general beastliness of things happening in the world to-day.&#8221; What right has anyone to make such an assertion?</p>
<p>If he really said this, he belittles those who are hiding their agony of mind, suffering bravely and carrying on unselfishly for the sake of others. Many people, possibly even more &#8220;sensitive,&#8221; have lost their all and seen appalling happenings, yet they take their part nobly in this fight for God against the devil.</p>
<p>Where are our ideals of love and faith? And what shall we all be if we listen to and sympathize with this sort of &#8220;I cannot carry on?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Mrs. Hicks&#8217;s ideals of love and faith, apparently, did not include empathy. Upon reading this, Leonard Woolf was so appalled that he immediately sent to the newspaper an emotionally charged fact-check rebuttal:</p>
<blockquote><p>I feel that I should not silently allow to remain on record that Virginia Woolf committed suicide because she could not face the &#8220;terrible times&#8221; through which all of us are going. For this is not true… Then newspapers give her words as:</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel I cannot go on any longer in these terrible times.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is not what she wrote: the words which she wrote are:</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel that I am going mad again. I feel we can&#8217;t go through another of those terrible times.&#8221;</p>
<p>She had had a mental breakdown about twenty-five years ago; the old symptoms began to return about three weeks before she took her life, and she felt that this time she would not recover. Like everyone else, she felt the general strain of the war, and the return of her illness was partly due to that strain. But the words of her letter and everything which she has ever said prove that she took her life, not because she could not &#8220;carry on,&#8221; but because she felt she was going mad again and would not this time recover.</p></blockquote>
<p>But, devastatingly, even Leonard&#8217;s rebuttal, too, was twisted out of context. Published under the already misleading headline &#8220;I Cannot Carry On&#8221; &#8212; the then-version of clickbait &#8212; the article replaced the phrase &#8220;<em>those</em> terrible times,&#8221; Virginia&#8217;s reference to her first acute bout of depression in her youth, with &#8220;<em>these</em> terrible times,&#8221; changing the meaning completely and making it a reference to World War II, an interpretation that aligned quite conveniently with the media&#8217;s spin of Woolf&#8217;s suicide as an act of unpatriotic cowardice rather than a personal tragedy. To make matters even more lamentable, the <em>Times</em> reprinted the misquotation several days later &#8212; the then-version of reblogging or retweeting without critical analysis and fact-checking. Similar attacks, some of which were even unleashed on Woolf&#8217;s posthumously published work, continued in the press for more than a year.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Afterwords-Letters-Death-Virginia-Woolf/dp/0813535603?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/virginiawoolfsuicide.jpg" alt="" width="500"/></a></p>
<p>The incident is particularly unsettling for two reasons: At its root is a testament to what a cruel and indiscriminate predator depression is, capable of consuming even humanity&#8217;s greatest minds, yet the uncompassionate response illustrates <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2014/03/24/the-depths-rottenberg-depression/">just how poorly we understand the condition</a>. Above all, however, embedded in the media&#8217;s treatment of Virginia&#8217;s suicide is a grotesque reminder that the only thing more morally repugnant than passing judgment on another human being&#8217;s private struggle and inner world &#8212; than choosing self-righteousness over compassionate understanding &#8212; is doing so publicly, especially as a currency of tabloidism. What a spectacular failing of the awareness that it&#8217;s far more rewarding <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2013/10/23/7-lessons-from-7-years/">to understand than to be right</a>. One can only hope this awareness has evolved for us, both as a culture and as individuals, since Woolf&#8217;s time.</p>
