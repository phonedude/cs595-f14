There are people determined to profit from expanding and redefining what’s public, working to treat nearly everything we say or do as a public work they can exploit. They may succeed before we even put up a fight.</p><p name="6e84" class="graf--p graf--empty"><a id="6e84"></a><br></p><h3 name="cfdb" class="graf--h3"><a id="cfdb"></a>We are all public defenders.</h3><p name="02a2" class="graf--p"><a id="02a2"></a>Oh, we love “public”. From public schools to public servants, we are all public defenders.</p><p name="ae13" class="graf--p"><a id="ae13"></a>In popular discourse, most debate assumes either you are doing something that is public, or you are not. But in reality, the vast <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">majority </em>of what we do exists on a continuum that is neither clearly public nor strictly private. So why do we get this disconnect between rhetoric and reality? Because there are two communities keenly interested in reducing the complexity of publicness:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="b36c" class="graf--li"><a id="b36c"></a>The media industry benefits from things that are in a gray area being treated as “public”, because this makes it (at best) fair game for discussion or (at worst) raw materials to feed the insatiable need for new content.</li><li name="589d" class="graf--li"><a id="589d"></a>The technology industry benefits from treating “public” as a binary state because handling more complex forms of privacy can be more expensive to accommodate in software, and because tech companies increasingly rely on the same advertising model which supports media, where public information is more valuable because it can be monetized.</li></ul><p name="52eb" class="graf--p"><a id="52eb"></a>These two powerful industries are enabled by a third: Policy. Policy makers and regulators are the only remaining group that could significantly affect the definition of what’s “public”. Thus far they, like all of society, have chosen to ignore the fact that our laws are wildly out of date in this regard. Everything from harassment laws to copyright battles to judicial decisions around privacy are all grounded in pre-Internet criteria of what constitutes public behavior or a public person. But educating lawmakers about the new, complex world of what’s public would be expensive, especially since it would be a battle against the combined force of the technology and media industries.</p><p name="5a77" class="graf--p"><a id="5a77"></a>It’s no wonder that voices arguing for a more complex, nuanced definition of “public” aren’t being heard.</p><h3 name="9cee" class="graf--h3"><a id="9cee"></a>The Public vs. Media</h3><p name="36b9" class="graf--p"><a id="36b9"></a>Recent months have provided no shortage of reductive oversimplifications of “public”, usually voiced as condescending scolding.

But inside these newsrooms, there is no apparent debate over whether it’s any different to embed a tweet from the President of the United States or from a vulnerable young activist who might not have anticipated her words being attached to her real identity, where she can be targeted by anonymous harassers.</p><p name="e8a9" class="graf--p"><a id="e8a9"></a>What if the public speech on Facebook and Twitter is more akin to a conversation happening between two people at a restaurant? Or two people speaking quietly at home, albeit near a window that happens to be open to the street?

The same tools are being used for person-to-person conversations and for making grand pronouncements to the world, often by the same person at different times. Would we say “Don’t write anything in a sealed letter that you don’t want to see on the front page of the newspaper” simply because the technology exists to read that letter without opening it?</p><p name="6183" class="graf--p"><a id="6183"></a>Most media outlets routinely take semi-public, gray-area conversations, and the information implicitly or explicitly revealed in them, and consider them to be fodder, with no need for approval from the creators of the messages.

We can’t do that if we are still pretending that taking information that was merely<em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> available </em>and instead making it <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">easily accessible</em> is an act without any moral or ethical consequences.</p><h3 name="edb6" class="graf--h3"><a id="edb6"></a>The Public vs. Tech</h3><p name="a911" class="graf--p"><a id="a911"></a>Programmers and engineers who create software with controls for privacy have moved in recent years to an on/off model where content is either viewable to the entire world or only to a list of people whom a user identifies as “friends”. Obviously, reducing public status to a binary consideration is convenient for a medium where everything must ultimately be represented in binary code. But we can’t let society’s norms be defined by which features are least expensive for storing on a database server in the cloud.</p><p name="f90a" class="graf--p"><a id="f90a"></a>At a deeper level, we have not reckoned with the fact that technology can make public things that were private in the past. The most common way this happens is because social networks like Facebook change their privacy controls unilaterally over time, making information that used to be private suddenly become public.</p><figure name="80dc" class="graf--figure"><a id="80dc"></a><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 579px;"><div class="aspect-ratio-fill" style="padding-bottom: 82.69999999999999%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*uZCQ7s1d26dqALTIo53sdQ.gif" data-width="810" data-height="670" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*uZCQ7s1d26dqALTIo53sdQ.gif" src="https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*uZCQ7s1d26dqALTIo53sdQ.gif"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Facebook profile information that is publicly visible by default, for the first five years of the service.

Indeed, the most consistent efforts Facebook has put into its <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wired.com/2012/08/ts_column/" data-href="http://www.wired.com/2012/08/ts_column/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">Terms of Service changes</a> over the past several years have been about cementing their ability to unilaterally make such changes while eliminating methods of recourse for users, such as prohibiting class action suits from being filed against the company.</p><p name="7302" class="graf--p"><a id="7302"></a>But there’s another, more subtle, way in which the big technology companies are making formerly-private actions public. Because so many processes that used to happen in phone calls or on paper have now moved to digital systems that are connected to the Internet, many actions have become much more tangible and detailed.</p><p name="f5c1" class="graf--p"><a id="f5c1"></a>Many smartphone users don’t realize that the photos they take often include the user’s geographic location hidden in the image. A regular user of a smartphone photo-sharing app who thinks she’s merely revealing her fondness for latte art may not realize that she’s providing a clear map of her exact location, stamped with the date and time accurate down to the second. By the standards of contemporary tech and media companies, displaying this information to the world in the form of “Here is a map showing where this person is every Tuesday at 9am ” is a perfectly acceptable thing to publish about hundreds of millions of people, without their consent, because these companies consider this information public.</p><p name="9e9d" class="graf--p"><a id="9e9d"></a>This isn’t a theoretical concern — I’m cofounder of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thinkup.com/" data-href="https://www.thinkup.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">a company</a> that gathers and analyzes a lot of social media data for users of our product. Even as a tiny startup, choosing not to publish user information that’s technically public can directly impact how many new users sign up and how much existing users come back to use the service. When we imagine those impacts for services that have hundreds of millions of users, when a tiny percentage increase in these metrics could materially impact what they report to shareholders, it’s easy to understand how the giant technology companies make their decisions.</p><h3 name="d972" class="graf--h3"><a id="d972"></a>The Public vs. Policy</h3><p name="f0f2" class="graf--p"><a id="f0f2"></a>Given that both the media and the tech industry have been claiming for years that “public” is a clear-cut, resolved concept, it is no surprise that government officials have believed them. Agencies, legislators and regulators aren’t going to proactively stir up the pot over such an esoteric concept.</p><p name="9624" class="graf--p"><a id="9624"></a>Clearly, one reason law has stayed out of date in regard to what’s public is because two of our biggest industries profit from that anachronism. But another key reason is because a creeping expansion of what’s considered public enables one of the most effective tools for expanding the power of the state: surveillance.</p><p name="a650" class="graf--p"><a id="a650"></a>Advancing technologies have made it cheaper than ever to harvest enormous quantities of data about nearly everyone. Much has rightly been written about the NSA’s monitoring of citizens, but precious little attention has been paid to the fact that their monitoring was made easy because tech companies routinely record everything that they can about the actions, activity and communications of the people who use their services.
