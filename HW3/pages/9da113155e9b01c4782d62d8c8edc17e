Over the course of five days, thousands of fans descended upon Minneapolis to celebrate America&rsquo;s favorite pastime and, ultimately, to watch some of the best players in the game square off against each other.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlmost as popular as the All\u002dStar game, of course, is the Home Run Derby where baseball&rsquo;s power hitters compete to see who can knock the most balls out of the park. Unlike the patience and restraint these players would show at a regular season game, those that step up to the plate at the Home Run Derby swing at just about anything that comes their way &ndash; whether the ball is in their strike zone or not.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat&rsquo;s a fine strategy for Home Run Derby hitters, but not for investors. And the longer the market bumps along without much movement in either direction, the likelihood that investors will start swinging at pitches outside of their strike zone increases. That for me, and for a growing number of leaders in the financial realm, is cause for some concern.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs Fed Chair Janet Yellen recently told the Wall Street Journal: &ldquo;I am... mindful of the potential for low interest rates to heighten the incentives of financial market participants to reach for yield and take on risk.&rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter losing so much of their wealth during the financial crisis, U.S. investors are anxious to rebuild. The problem, however, is there is no easy or fast way to do that today, particularly at a time when interest rates are at historic lows and yields on cash deposits are close to 0%.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe S&amp;P 500 is sitting at an all\u002dtime high with very little fanfare. And the CBOE&rsquo;s Volatility Index (VIX) reading continues to hover under 12. (The VIX is a key measure of market expectations of near\u002dterm volatility conveyed by S&amp;P 500 stock index option prices.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe last big spike in volatility occurred in late summer 2011, around the time the U.S. lost its AAA credit rating and in the midst of the European debt crisis. Since then, the S&amp;P has rallied 80 percent.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you believe the teachings of the late financial economist and professor Hyman Minsky, financial crises are caused by investors taking on additional risk during bull markets. They take on so much risk, in fact, that they tip the balance and instability ensues.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn many respects, increased risk appetite is a good thing. Increased risk appetite is what prompts entrepreneurs to start a new business and gives established business owners the confidence to expand. Improved risk appetite also gets investors off the sidelines and back into the market again.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo gauge risk appetite, our sister organization, RBC&rsquo;s Global Asset Management division (RBC GAM) combines many different measures into a single risk appetite index. Last fall, that index showed risk appetite at historic average levels. Investors were neither seeking risk nor shying away from it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut risk appetite spends very little time around its average level. Instead, risk appetite tends to sit either at well\u002dbelow average levels &ndash; as was the case during the last financial crisis &ndash; or at moderately above\u002daverage levels during periods in which extended favorable market conditions prompt investors to shift into what we call &ldquo;risk\u002dseeking&rdquo; mode.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"center\" src=\"http://m.c.lnkd.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/p/5/005/078/1eb/3a80cc4.jpg\" alt=\"\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo it&rsquo;s not surprising that RBC GAM&rsquo;s index shows that investors have ventured into the risk\u002dseeking zone since last fall.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe market may not be doing much now and volatility may be low, but what if that changes? What if we see a rise in interest rates? Investors should step out of the batter&rsquo;s box once in a while, and think ahead about how such changes could impact their current portfolios. Higher interest rates, for example, could hurt bond values as well as &ldquo;bond\u002dlike&rdquo; equities like utilities.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt might be tempting to swing outside of your strike zone right now because you are bored. But before you stretch too much for yield, understand what your strike zone really looks like today. Many investors don&rsquo;t understand their risk tolerance or how certain risk factors can impact them on a short\u002d to immediate time period.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou may want to try to knock one out of the park. But your best chance of doing that is to remain patient, stay disciplined, hit singles and doubles and wait for what Warren Buffett famously calls &ldquo;the fat pitch&rdquo; before swinging for the fences.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eJohn G.

But after introducing &ldquo;the Oracle of Omaha&rdquo; to attendees at Forbes 2014 Summit on Philanthropy last month, I&rsquo;m not so sure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eQuite a few of the guests at the Forbes Summit lunch (held at the New York Public Library) had signed up for Bill Gates and Buffett&rsquo;s Giving Pledge, a commitment by billionaires to give at least half their wealth to charity &ndash; during their lifetimes or upon their death. That&rsquo;s at least $500+ million a pop. Now \u003cem\u003ethat&rsquo;s\u003c/em\u003e an expensive lunch.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn the one hand, the popularity of the Forbes Summit and the response to the Giving Pledge (as of May 2014, 127 billionaires have signed the pledge) may simply demonstrate that beyond a certain point, privately accumulated wealth loses its utility value. As Buffett put it, &ldquo;Nothing I am giving away will change my life, materially, in any way.&rdquo; Joking about the billionaires who had turned down the invitation to join his Giving Pledge, Buffett remarked, &ldquo;What they&rsquo;re really saying is that they can&rsquo;t make ends meet on $500 million.&rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut that&rsquo;s not all that&rsquo;s going on. There are growing indications that for high net worth individuals, leaving a legacy is about more than just passing core values like honesty and integrity on to the next generation; it&rsquo;s about harnessing financial success to help make the community and the world a better place.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAccording to the \u003ca href=\"http://www.rbcwealthmanagement.com/wealth\u002dinsights\u002dresearch/thought\u002dleadership/wwr/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWorld Wealth Report 2014\u003c/a\u003e, released in mid\u002dJune by RBC Wealth Management and Capgemini, the vast majority of global high net worth investors (92 percent) said they feel it is important that they give their time, money or expertise to causes and activities that make a positive social impact &ndash; a sentiment that is strongest among investors under the age of 40.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePeople of wealth have always volunteered on boards of not\u002dfor\u002dprofit organizations, or have given their money to charity. (The New York Public Library&rsquo;s main branch is now named the StephenA.SchwarzmanBuilding following a $100 million commitment by the private equity maven to the city&rsquo;s library system.) But today, the percentage of philanthropists giving in traditional ways is equaled by the percentage who are &ldquo;making investment choices with a clearly defined social objective.&rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe World Wealth Report 2014 indicates that &ldquo;high net worth individuals are venturing beyond traditional means of fulfilling their social impact goals.&rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSocial impact investing enables investors to align their investment strategies with their values. Those values can range from supporting healthy environments, sustaining communities or promoting diverse workforces and humane working environments.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnlike traditional financial investments, the returns in impact investing aren&rsquo;t measured solely in dollars. They are measured by changes in social or environmental policies and outcomes. While the degree of change can be difficult to measure, there are signs that the increasing flows of investment dollars into impact investing are indeed making a difference.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTake for example the increased transparency and accountability at publicly traded companies around the topic of sustainability.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn early June, the Governance &amp; Accountability Institute reported that 72 percent of companies listed on the S&amp;P 500 index now publish corporate sustainability reports. That&rsquo;s not only an overwhelming majority, but a stark improvement over the mere 19 percent of S&amp;P 500 companies that did so in 2011.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSustainability reports highlight the economic, environmental and social impacts of companies&rsquo; everyday activities. The reports also showcase an organization's values and demonstrate the link between its strategy and those values.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt&rsquo;s not a stretch to think that these sustainability reports cater, at least in part, to social impact investors/shareholders, who have become an increasingly important constituency to corporate management.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCorporate responsibility is no longer about how you give money away; it&rsquo;s about the way you make money &ndash; about the culture and the values that inform your operating practices.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA company that gives millions to organizations that preserve and protect the environment yet pays no mind to the impact its own operations have on natural resources isn&rsquo;t practicing true corporate responsibility.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eClearly, something important is going on. Behind the growing interest in corporate responsibility and &ldquo;investments of purpose&rdquo; is, I believe, recognition that we are all members of a global community whose future is our individual and collective responsibility. In a world with seven billion people living in it, a world in which all economies are interconnected and interdependent, no longer can it be argued that any action by a private party doesn&rsquo;t impact somebody else, somewhere in the world, in some way. That&rsquo;s why philanthropy and stewardship and community are closely related.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen we see ourselves as members of a community &ndash; whether local, regional, national or even global &ndash; it is a short step to feeling responsible for others in that community, to viewing our actions in terms of the effect they have on others, and to converting privately accumulated wealth with a personal utility value of zero to socially impactful giving and investing strategies that can help create a future that is better than today.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eJohn G.

I wrote an article called &ldquo;Apology to My Daughter&rdquo; that was the first step on an advocacy journey that led to my being named the National Gay &amp; Lesbian Chamber of Commerce&rsquo;s Executive of the Year in 2010 and my leadership role in marshalling the business community to help legalize same\u002dsex marriage in the state of Minnesota.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe past few years have seen many signs that respect for differences in sexual orientation have reached a tipping point.

Remember Superstorm Sandy in 2012 which ravaged 24 states along the eastern seaboard. Many communities were left without the basic needs of shelter, food and clean water much less the &ldquo;luxury&rdquo; of electricity. In the summer of 2013, historic flooding in the Greater Toronto Area caused almost $1 billion in property damage, making it the most expensive natural disaster in that region&rsquo;s history, knocking out power for days and disrupting travel.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUrban storm water runoff, it turns out, is the leading cause of water pollution. I know something about this issue because early in my career, as an aide to the mayor of St. Paul, Minnesota, I worked a massive, decade\u002dlong project to address a problem many urban areas still face &ndash; the fact that their storm sewer systems and their sanitary sewers are not fully separated. During heavy rainfalls, water runs off concrete surfaces without green spaces to absorb the excess. Storm sewers spill over into the sewer systems that carry waste from our homes, overwhelming water treatment facilities that weren&rsquo;t built to handle these deluges and ultimately flowing untreated into critical water resources &hellip; like the Mississippi River, in the case of St. Paul.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe equation is simple &ndash; climate change leads to extreme weather, which directly affects water quality.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe each have the responsibility to be stewards of our environment.

These films won&rsquo;t be watched by as many people as &ldquo;Noah&rdquo; &ndash; but they are more important.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne lesson I learned from Alexandra is that the key to addressing water quality issues is to act locally. Be aware of what needs to be done in your backyard, your neighborhood, your community &ndash; and do something. At a time when government leaders appear to have neither the will nor the resources to take action, we can and must make a difference in our own communities.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo, in honor of Earth Day, do the planet some good. Plant some green, clean up a stream or a lake, volunteer at a local nonprofit whose mission is to preserve and protect water.

Trilling&rsquo;s premise was that Western society has gradually evolved away from a construct of morality he calls &ldquo;sincerity&rdquo; to a formulation of morality more admired and respected in the modern era, which he terms &ldquo;authenticity.&quot; Trilling doesn&rsquo;t do enough to help his readers understand the difference between the two words: but I&rsquo;ve always visualized the difference by contrasting my mother and my mother\u002din\u002dlaw. My mother was &ldquo;authentic&rdquo;: an artist, daughter of a world\u002dclass narcissist, a recovering alcoholic, suffering from anxiety and depression all her life, possibly the most eccentric person I have ever known (living alone on a farm in rural Georgia with 100 goats, llamas, miniature horses, basset hounds, roosters, Vietnamese pot\u002dbellied pigs), but absolutely committed to being true to herself, no matter what others thought of her. My mother\u002din\u002dlaw, on the other hand, is quintessentially &ldquo;sincere&rdquo; (in Trilling&rsquo;s terms): a Midwestern matriarch, traditionally social, active in her community, fiercely family\u002dfocused, insisting always on presenting the best possible &ldquo;buck up&rdquo; face to the world no matter how she felt or what was going on inside her family.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAuthenticity is about being true to oneself (even at the expense of social connection). Sincerity is about connecting with others (even at the expense of personal truth).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat does this have to do with Finance?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat does it have to do with social media, for that matter?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the wake of the financial crisis of 2008\u002d2009, investors and other consumers of financial services care a great deal about &ldquo;authenticity.&quot; Increasingly, they are screening the individuals and firms they work with through the lens of whether those service providers have values that align with their own, and whether their behavior is consistent with their values.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAuthenticity, today, is a differentiator. That&rsquo;s true in business generally; but it&rsquo;s particularly true in financial services&hellip; because authenticity has a lot to do with rebuilding and maintaining the trust that was damaged by and in the financial crisis.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInvestors and consumers of financial services are also communicating and transacting more than ever before through digital channels, including social networks, although regulatory constraints continue to limit the ability of financial firms to communicate digitally with their clients as much as their clients would like.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe challenge is this: How do you convey or project authenticity through social media channels? How do you project a commitment to being &ldquo;true to yourself&rdquo; through channels which are all about connecting, being social, having as many &ldquo;followers&rdquo; or &ldquo;connections&rdquo; as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTraditional literature is filled with characters who are &ldquo;authentic&rdquo;&mdash;Holden Caulfield from &ldquo;Catcher in the Rye&rdquo; comes to mind&mdash;but who wouldn&rsquo;t come across very well to potential followers in the age of social media. Introspection and speaking one&rsquo;s truth in isolation don&rsquo;t translate well into brand value in a digital age.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy LinkedIn panel was only able to address this question in a limited manner&hellip;. But we did conclude that in order to convey &ldquo;authenticity&rdquo; through social media, one&rsquo;s message and intellectual content need to be about helping others &mdash;whether by teaching, informing, enabling, inspiring&mdash;rather than about self\u002dpromotion.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBeing authentically sincere&mdash;connecting with others out of a corporate mission and sense of purpose that is all about helping others&mdash;that&rsquo;s how to differentiate in social media channels.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother way to put this is that \u003cem\u003eboth \u003c/em\u003eauthenticity (personal truth) \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e sincerity (caring about and connecting with others) are required to build the kind of social media brand customers and clients are looking for these days.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003ePhoto: \u003ca href=\"http://www.shutterstock.com/gallery\u002d273481p1.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003escyther5\u003c/a\u003e / shutterstock\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","permLink":"20140220143616\u002d229992090\u002dsincerity\u002dand\u002dauthenticity\u002din\u002dsocial\u002dmedia","publishDateAsString":"Thu Feb 20 14:36:16 UTC 2014","_partial_post":{},"imageUrl":"http://m.c.lnkd.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/p/2/005/045/002/3a49620.jpg","publishedDate":1392906976000,"state":"PUBLISHED","_fmt_publishedTime":"February 20, 2014","url_image_thumb":"https://media.licdn.com/media\u002dproxy/ext?w=60&h=40&f=c&hash=rpkwT78DDfugc%2FaoZwjwVbYl7jA%3D&ora=1%2CaFBCTXdkRmpGL2lvQUFBPQ%2CxAVta9Er0VzkkFUWzBclrqKIrku\u002dqkRISM3REnK\u002dBmXo5ZWfYmjpecLAebaku10WejMCwQA7ee2oXmqhRQ"},{"image":"http://m.c.lnkd.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/p/3/005/032/053/216badc.jpg","articleId":5820980022957068288,"publishDate":1387832237000,"publishArticle":true,"_link_postLink":"http://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20131223205717\u002d229992090\u002da\u002dbig\u002dyear\u002dfor\u002dbig\u002dbill?trk=mp\u002ddetails\u002drr\u002drmpost","impressions":6247,"title":"A Big Year for \"Big Bill\"","authorId":229992090,"content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg class=\"left\" src=\"http://m.c.lnkd.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/p/3/005/032/053/216badc.jpg\" alt=\"\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn case you hadn&rsquo;t noticed, there was a resurgence of interest this past year in my great\u002dgrandfather, William Howard Taft, 27th President of the United States and the only President also to serve as Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMost notably, of course, was Doris Kearns Goodwin&rsquo;s decision to let &ldquo;Big Bill,&rdquo;

This isn&rsquo;t the first time the U.S. government has shut down &ndash; it&rsquo;s actually the \u003cem\u003eeighteenth \u003c/em\u003etime. But for all the noise and sensational political theater it&rsquo;s creating, the government shutdown isn&rsquo;t what really matters. The debt ceiling could have a far bigger impact on financial markets and on the economy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Treasury reports that on October 17 the U.S. government is expected to reach its credit limit, a staggering $16.699 trillion used to pay bills the government&rsquo;s already racked up. At that point the U.S. Treasury will have only $30 billion or so in cash to cover expenses &hellip; including principal and interest.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhich means the United States of America could default on its publicly\u002dissued debt.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhich could, in the near term, be catastrophic.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe reasons for that are surprisingly technical ones. As my colleagues at RBC Capital Markets point out:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e&ldquo;The U.S. Treasury&rsquo;s systems do not clearly mark what scheduled payments are for what reasons, so it is impractical to try to prioritize payments. Clearing systems &hellip; do not allow defaulted securities to flow, so the system would seize. Also the Fed does not take defaulted securities as collateral at the discount window, even if those securities are still trading at par. Markets are not set up to trade or finance defaulted Treasuries. Repurchase agreements (&ldquo;Repos&rdquo;), a widely used funding device, say that defaulted securities cannot be delivered as collateral. Delivery systems are not set up to easily sort out which Treasuries have defaulted and which have not, so Repo markets can seize up as the debt ceiling drop\u002ddead date approaches.&rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is analogous to what happened when the Reserve Primary Fund, a money market fund, &ldquo;broke the buck&rdquo; in 2008 and indefinitely suspended redemptions of its shares bringing the financial markets to the brink of collapse. Operational systems weren&rsquo;t designed to (and therefore couldn&rsquo;t) process shares of money market funds that weren&rsquo;t priced at par &hellip; any more than they can handle U.S. Treasury securities that are in default.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBoth of these cases are the equivalent of grains of sand being poured into a car&rsquo;s gas tank: pretty quickly the engine and the gears (financial markets) are going to grind to a halt.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs we eagerly wait for the negotiating endgame between Republicans and Democrats, we are likely to see the financial markets become far more volatile. That&rsquo;s what happened in the summer of 2011 &ndash; the last time we faced an imminent threat of default &ndash; when the U.S. equity markets experienced some of the biggest price swings in history.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut as with the government shutdown, it&rsquo;s important for investors to shut out some of the noise and look beyond the headlines. Because the chances that the United States of America is not going to eventually pay its debts is not just close to 0%. It is 0%. Unlike other sovereign borrowers who have defaulted, we clearly have the wherewithal to pay our debts (at least for decades to come).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDefault, if it comes, will be essentially a technical default caused by the stewardship failure of political leaders in the Dysfunctional Circus to act in the long\u002dterm best interests of our country.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThink about the string of dramatic events we&rsquo;ve endured in the past couple of decades without any lasting effect on the markets &ndash; everything from natural disasters to terrorist attacks to wars to financial crises. Each time, the markets have bounced back.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA default by the United States won&rsquo;t be pretty. But unless you really think we don&rsquo;t have the capacity to pay, it&rsquo;s not enough to cause long\u002dterm investors to change, much less abandon, their long\u002dterm investment strategies. If anything, it might present the kind of investing opportunities we last saw in the winter of 2008\u002d2009, at the depths of the financial crises.

<p> </p>
<p>&quot;You&rsquo;d get very rich if you thought of yourself as having a card with only twenty punches in a lifetime, and every financial decision used up one punch. You&rsquo;d resist the temptation to dabble. You&rsquo;d make more good decisions and you&rsquo;d make more big decisions.&quot; &mdash;Warren Buffett , quoted in <em>The Snowball<strong>,</strong></em> by Alice Schroeder</p>
</blockquote><p>This week, Warren Buffett celebrates his 84th birthday.</p><p>Those of you who follow my blogs know I have a bit of a man crush on Buffett, not just because of his investing acumen but because he has always seemed to me endowed with a kind of uber-common sense&hellip; an ability to cut to the heart of a situation or an issue and capture it in a few words, understandable to experts and common folk alike.</p><p>Lists of his &ldquo;10-greatest&rdquo; or &ldquo;18-greatest&rdquo; (or however-many-greatest) sayings pop up everywhere in online searches. But the Buffett-ism that&rsquo;s stayed with me is the one at the top of this blog &ndash; namely, the notion of a punch card (a quaintly antiquated thing you don&rsquo;t run across very often these days).</p><p>Buffett used his punch card analogy in an investment context. It&rsquo;s consistent with his belief that really profitable investment decisions are few and far between. His counsel to individual investors has always been to &ldquo;wait for the fat pitch.&rdquo; [See &ldquo;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20140710194222-229992090-the-warren-buffett-effect-investing-in-our-world?trk=mp-edit-rr-posts" target="_blank">Bored Investors Beware</a>.&rdquo;]</p><p>But I think the punch card analogy applies equally well to life, and to the decisions that define and shape our lives over the five, six, seven or eight decades most of us are on the earth. For someone graduating from high school, I think the number 20 is just about right. For someone like me, in middle age, the number of un-punched punches on the card is a lot smaller. There might be only two or three left.</p><p>The point is, whether it&rsquo;s two or twenty, the number of inflection points in our lives is a lot smaller than it often seems. The trick is having the wisdom, or the instinct, to recognize &ldquo;fat pitches&rdquo; at the time they show up, which is always easier in hindsight. Then we need to make our big decisions count.</p><p>Getting married. Having children (or not). Making a career change. Starting or investing in a business. Those are obvious hole punches.</p><p>By contrast, the last two times I punched my card it had less to do with me, personally, than it did the opportunity to make a difference in the lives of others.</p><p>The first of these was agreeing to chair Wall Street&rsquo;s advocacy group &ndash; the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association &ndash; in the wake of the financial crisis. I did so because I never wanted our clients, the investing public, to have to go through again the trauma and disruption they experienced in their financial and personal lives during that unprecedented and volatile period.</p><p>My second recent hole punch was deciding to help lead, in 2011 and 2012, a campaign to defeat a constitutional amendment that would have banned same-sex marriage in my home state of Minnesota. I got a lot of advice and counsel against getting involved, as a business leader, in what became known as the &ldquo;Vote No&rdquo; campaign. But every bone in my body told me this was a once-in-a-lifetime chance to make a difference in the lives of tens of thousands of LGBT residents in a state long known for its progressive brand, inclusive culture and values of respect and tolerance.</p><p>As it turned out, the support of the business community was critical not only in defeating the amendment, but then, six months later, legalizing same-sex marriage in Minnesota.</p><p>That was last year. Just this month, two gay friends who had lived together for 34 years before getting married last year at Minneapolis&rsquo; City Hall thanked me, with tears in their eyes, for being able to celebrate their first ever wedding anniversary.</p><p>I wish someone had told me about Buffett&rsquo;s punch card analogy when I was a lot younger. However, I&rsquo;m glad I have the opportunity to use it now to recognize and lean into the few remaining &ldquo;big decisions&rdquo; in my life. I pass it on here as a birthday gift to others &ndash; not from me, but from Warren Buffett, who, by the simple arithmetic of his own analogy, has made a big decision once in every four of his 84 years.</p><p><em>John G.

Not giving away all of his wealth the way that St Francis did?\n\nIn the Bible they also say,\"Do not judge for fear of being judged, do not condemn for fear of being condemned, for God will use with you the same measure that you used with other people\"...

I think I'm being discriminated against because of my age.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLooking back, it's easy to see where they went wrong...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs the saying goes, &quot;hindsight is 20/20&quot; \u002d and for these folks, it's not hard to see where they went off\u002dcourse in their career journey. The sad part is, they were doing what they were told to do: make peace with your career and take care of the other areas of your life. Sounds like good advice, but in reality, not focusing on the career that gives you financial security and a sense of identity can come back to haunt you. Especially these days, when the average length of a job assignment is two years and changing jobs frequently is the 'new normal' in career development.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDon't want this to be your future?

We justify it by saying, &quot;I've worked hard to get where I am, I can take the gas of the pedal for a bit.&quot; But in reality, you can never, ever stop learning and growing in your career. The moment you chose to slow down, you are putting yourself in a category of people who are seen as on the down\u002dtrend in their careers. Employers hire rising stars, not falling ones.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2) Figure out your specialty.\u003c/strong\u003e As we get seasoned in our careers, employers expect us to bring more value in the form of a specialty. We are the aspirin to their pain. The more we can prove we will alleviate their bigger headaches, the more they'll pay. Job security is about building up an expertise that is in\u002ddemand. It's up to us to follow the emerging trends in our field and to build up our skills so they can help employers solve the pressing problems they face. There's nothing worse than waking up one day and realizing your skills aren't valuable to an employer. Your earning potential immediately plummets \u002d as does your job security.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3) Network consistently.\u003c/strong\u003e As we move along in our careers, it's easy to say, \u003cem\u003e&quot;I have enough professional contacts, I don't need any more.&quot;\u003c/em\u003e This couldn't be more wrong. Just ask anyone who has tried to get references from retired managers or companies that are out of business. Your network ages out of the marketplace if you don't focus on acquiring new contacts to backfill the ones that fall out. That means reaching out to people your age or YOUNGER, to build partnerships and stay connected in the industry. Not to mention, it helps you to stay up\u002dto\u002ddate on the latest trends and can instill you with the youthful energy and excitement for your industry that may have long since left you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBlaming employers won't help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI'm sure some of you reading this feel employers should take responsibility for all the older workers they laid\u002doff and are no longer looking to hire. I often get asked, &quot;Where's the loyalty?&quot; However, neither you nor I can change the way business is going right now. The fact is, employers are no longer offering full\u002dtime long\u002dterm employment to anybody.

Employers want to know you are back on track. There's an entire branding process you should go through (which I will discuss in a future post), in order to get hiring managers to consider you. Do that first, and then you can focus on re\u002dbuilding the career trajectory.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you made these career mistakes, it's not too late.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you can recognize and accept what's happened, you can make changes and get back in the game.
