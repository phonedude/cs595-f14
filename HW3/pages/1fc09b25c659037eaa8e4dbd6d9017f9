By spring, 2009 I had to sell my house. I was penniless and couch surfing with friends. JavaScript turned that all around. Fast forward to 2010, I had a great job, and I was commuting through downtown San Francisco. One day I literally tripped over a homeless man who was trying to sleep on a cardboard box in the middle of the sidewalk. The conditions that homeless people are forced to endure are shocking. They <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">should</em> be shocking. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">We should be outraged.</strong></p><p name="1345" class="graf--p"><a id="1345"></a><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">How did we let this happen? How is it that we can send a rover to Mars, but we can’t afford basic dignity and respect for the people who need it the most?</em> How is it that our brilliant solution to this problem is to put <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">spikes in doorways</strong> to discourage people from laying down?</p><p name="85de" class="graf--p"><a id="85de"></a>Ever since I personally faced the problem of finding shelter with no income, I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about how we might solve the problem for everybody. That’s what programmers do best: identify a common problem and figure out how to solve the problem more generally.</p><p name="0cb0" class="graf--p"><a id="0cb0"></a>You might think it’s impossible to solve a problem like homelessness. It’s so overwhelming! But you’d be wrong. In the US, we’re in the middle of a nation-wide initiative to end homelessness for good.</p><p name="13d2" class="graf--p"><a id="13d2"></a>Did you know it costs more money to let somebody sleep on the street than it costs to give them homes for free? The chronically homeless are hyper users of social services. They’re much more likely to require ambulance rides than people with homes, and since a homeless person typically doesn’t have health insurance, and they can’t pay a dime out of pocket, taxpayers foot the bill. In other words, we’re already giving each of them anywhere from $20 thousand to $3 Million every year for being homeless. Why not give them a lot more and spend a lot less money?</p><p name="38a9" class="graf--p"><a id="38a9"></a>That’s right. We, the <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">brilliant</strong> taxpayers of America, actually <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">pay</em> potentially millions of dollars per year <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">to keep one person on the street</em>. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/02/13/060213fa_fact" data-href="http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/02/13/060213fa_fact" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">Seriously</a>! We pay out of our collective pocket to keep people down. That’s the choice we make when we allow our government to make cheap investments in homeless services. It’s neglect. It’s that simple. And we’re all guilty of it.</p><p name="880c" class="graf--p graf--last"><a id="880c"></a>It doesn’t have to be this way.</p></div></div></section><section name="4a87" class=" section--bottomCenter section-image--fullBleed is-imageBackgrounded is-backgrounded is-darkBackgrounded"><div class="section-background" data-scroll="post-section"contenteditable="false" data-image-id="1*GoLL6XjGje-px-OWRxsy5g.jpeg" data-width="1600" data-height="1200"><div class="section-backgroundImage"style="background-image: url(https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/700/gradv/29/81/40/1*GoLL6XjGje-px-OWRxsy5g.jpeg);"></div><br></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner layoutSingleColumn"><p name="7f43" class="graf--p graf--first graf--last"><a id="7f43"></a>Photo: Homeless in San Francisco<br><a target="_blank" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/javi_velazquez/" data-href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/javi_velazquez/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" title="Go to javi.velazquez&#39;s photostream" rel="nofollow">javi.velazquez</a></p></div></div></section><section name="cb69"><div class="section-divider layoutSingleColumn"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner layoutSingleColumn"><p name="61e1" class="graf--p graf--first"><a id="61e1"></a>A few years ago, local governments across the states began to believe that it’s actually possible to <a target="_blank" href="http://endhomelessness.org/" data-href="http://endhomelessness.org/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">end homelessness</a> almost entirely. Some of them are having surprising success. For example, Salt Lake City, Utah had roughly 3,000 chronically homeless residents a few years ago. Now there are <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sfgate.com/nation/article/Salt-Lake-City-a-model-for-S-F-on-homeless-5587357.php" data-href="http://www.sfgate.com/nation/article/Salt-Lake-City-a-model-for-S-F-on-homeless-5587357.php" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">about 400</a>.</p><p name="ac9b" class="graf--p"><a id="ac9b"></a>How did they do that? They give away housing. Good housing that people actually want to live in. There are shelters still, but there’s a high turnover. People stay there just long enough to make arrangements for a new home, and that wait is measured in days or weeks, not months or years.</p><p name="d754" class="graf--p"><a id="d754"></a>Salt Lake City gets people off the streets quickly and into assisted living arrangements where they’re assigned caseworkers who help people find the services they need to become self-sufficient. And it’s working. Nationally, taxpayers save about $1.3 Billion by funding assisted housing programs.</p><p name="addb" class="graf--p"><a id="addb"></a>But assisted housing is only the first step. To really claim success, we need to help the homeless stand on their own feet. Contrary to the stereotypes, that’s something that most of them genuinely want to do.</p><p name="a773" class="graf--p"><a id="a773"></a>The next step is to find a job, and to do that, you need training, which brings me back to JavaScript.</p><p name="b87b" class="graf--p"><a id="b87b"></a>When I first learned and fell in love with JavaScript in the 90&#39;s, few people took it very seriously. Nobody guessed it would play the critical role it plays today. In case you’re not aware, most of the software applications we use and take for granted now are built with JavaScript. It powers Facebook, Twitter, Netflix, PayPal, and millions of other services.</p><p name="8f11" class="graf--p"><a id="8f11"></a>Because JavaScript is the only programming language supported by every modern browser, the entire web is dependent on it, making it the most widely used programming language in the world — and it’s still growing faster than any other programming language. There’s just one problem: There aren’t enough JavaScript developers to keep up with demand.</p><p name="20e6" class="graf--p"><a id="20e6"></a>Demand for software developers is so high that most of the top companies have an always hiring policy for developers; they hire as quickly as they can find qualified candidates, and when that’s not fast enough, they actively recruit candidates from other countries or outsource work to India.</p><p name="3a24" class="graf--p"><a id="3a24"></a>So we’re paying money to keep people on the streets and then going out of our way to give some of the best paying jobs in the world to foreign citizens. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Insanity</em>.</p><p name="9b06" class="graf--p"><a id="9b06"></a>Why is it national news when <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">one</em> homeless man learns to code? We should have <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">thousands</em> of homeless people training for high paying jobs every day. This situation is intolerable.</p><p name="0a3c" class="graf--p"><a id="0a3c"></a>I used to say to myself, “you can’t help everybody” a dozen times a day as I used San Francisco’s subway system that swarms with people pleading for help.</p><p name="0cd0" class="graf--p"><a id="0cd0"></a>I was wrong. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">You </em><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">can</em></strong><em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> help everybody.</em> Any of us can. In cities across the country there are programs supplying free housing to the homeless. Find the one nearest to you and donate some money there, instead. Quality housing first programs are our best chance of ending this for good.</p><figure name="d807" class="graf--figure graf--iframe"><a id="d807"></a><div class="iframeContainer"><iframe data-width="1280" data-height="720" width="700" height="394" src="/media/341e468338fb69c5c5ec093493b5808d?maxWidth=700" data-media-id="341e468338fb69c5c5ec093493b5808d" frameborder="0"></iframe></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Video: Cody McCarthy</figcaption></figure><p name="442a" class="graf--p"><a id="442a"></a>I’m donating in a different way.
