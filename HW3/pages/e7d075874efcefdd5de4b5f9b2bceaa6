	<h2 class="article-excerpt" itemprop="alternativeHeadline">The on-demand car service announced a new program aimed at providing economic opportunities to those who serve in the military </h2>
    <p>Uber announced a new <a href="http://blog.uber.com/ubermilitary" target="_blank">program</a> Wednesday that aims to get 50,000 military service members, veterans and spouses to enlist as drivers for the on-demand car service. Over the next 18 months, <a href="http://blog.uber.com/ubermilitary" target="_blank">UberMILITARY </a>will enlist drivers from the military community in an effort to &ldquo;empower them as entrepreneurs and small business owners,&rdquo; according to an Uber <a href="http://blog.uber.com/ubermilitary" target="_blank">blog post.</a></p>
<p>Uber says its drivers&#8217; flexible schedules could be of benefit to veterans working transition back into civilian life. The company also says the program could help members of the service community and their families combat the unique challenges they face, including high levels of unemployment and frequent relocation. Military spouses move an average of eight times over a 20-year career, while veterans under 25 face an unemployment rate of 21.4% (the national unemployment rate is 6.1%).</p>
<p>To achieve its goal, Uber is enlisting the help of former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, who will serve as the chairman of UberMILITARY&rsquo;s advisory board. In a joint op-ed published by <a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/09/robert-gates-uber-veterans-111039.html#.VBnIfD46Up8" target="_blank">Politico Magazine</a> Wednesday, Gates and Uber CEO Travis Kalanick said that &ldquo;UberMILITARY is a reflection that high-quality service, an unparalleled commitment to safety and the leadership potential inherent to small business entrepreneurship are values shared by those who have selflessly served our country.&rdquo;</p>

Over the next 18 months, <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.uber.com\/ubermilitary\" target=\"_blank\">UberMILITARY <\/a>will enlist drivers from the military community in an effort to &ldquo;empower them as entrepreneurs and small business owners,&rdquo; according to an Uber <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.uber.com\/ubermilitary\" target=\"_blank\">blog post.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Uber says its drivers&#8217; flexible schedules could be of benefit to veterans working transition back into civilian life. The company also says the program could help members of the service community and their families combat the unique challenges they face, including high levels of unemployment and frequent relocation. Military spouses move an average of eight times over a 20-year career, while veterans under 25 face an unemployment rate of 21.4% (the national unemployment rate is 6.1%).<\/p>\n<p>To achieve its goal, Uber is enlisting the help of former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, who will serve as the chairman of UberMILITARY&rsquo;s advisory board.

morning and spread to various neighborhoods, including across the iconic harbor in Kowloon. Tear gas even billowed into the city&#8217;s famously efficient subway system.<\/p>\n<p>Protesters chanted democracy slogans and sang songs by legendary 1980s Hong Kong rock band <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=TIeTcFgdd_4\" target=\"_blank\">Beyond<\/a>. Many were apparently drawn onto the street after becoming incensed that the police had fired tear gas at the crowds. Some 78 people were arrested, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.info.gov.hk\/gia\/general\/201409\/28\/P201409281053.htm\" target=\"_blank\">say<\/a> police.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This protest is definitely outside of anyone&#8217;s expectations,&#8221; says Maya Wang, a researcher for Human Rights Watch based in Hong Kong. &#8220;Both the government in Hong Kong and in Beijing are going to have a huge headache on their hands.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Occupy Central with Peace and Love, as the protest is officially known, aims to foment democratic change by paralyzing the heart of this freewheeling financial hub. It was originally slated to begin Wednesday, but an aligned student demonstration Friday gathered such momentum that its leaders brought the launch forward.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;We want to help the students achieve their goals,&rdquo; Benny Tai, a founder of Occupy Central, told TIME on Sunday morning. &ldquo;They want to stay here, and we want to support them.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>By Sunday afternoon, protesters brandishing umbrellas repeatedly charged at lines of riot police in front of Government House, only to be repelled by volleys of pepper spray. The protesters then retreated to regroup and rushed again. Each time, the cache of mangled umbrellas behind the police grew larger. As tensions rose, tear gas was fired at the crowd in Harcourt Road. Dozens of police and protesters were injured in the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;They needed to do something to control the scene, so they needed to shoot the gas,&#8221; a police spokesman told TIME. &#8220;[The protests] are not good for ordinary people.&#8221; Late Sunday evening, officers held banners aloft that read &#8220;disperse or we will fire&#8221; as rumors swirled of rubber bullets being readied.<\/p>\n<p>Hong Kong has been run under a &ldquo;one country, two systems&rdquo; since British colonial rule ended in 1997. Beijing had promised to let residents choose the city&rsquo;s Chief Executive, the tellingly corporate title of the top job in this bastion of free enterprise, by 2017, but now insists that all candidates must first be vetted by a committee perceived as curated by the Chinese Community Party.<\/p>\n<p>Hong Kong&rsquo;s democracy activists see this as a betrayal; Beijing retorts that the Special Administrative Region already enjoys considerable autonomy and lacks patriotism.<\/p>\n<p>Current Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying, a polarizing figure largely seen as loyal to the mainland, told reporters Sunday that Hong Kong was &#8220;not a self-contained democracy.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Any fair-minded person will come to the conclusion that the method of electing the Chief Executive in 2017 is more democratic,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is not ideal, but it is better.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>On Saturday, a public square attached to the government headquarters was stormed by students, and at least 74 people were arrested. That protest swelled to upwards of 50,000 people, according to organizers, congregating in the austere, concrete flanking areas.<\/p>\n<p>Hong Kong Police Commissioner Andy Tsang Wai-Hung defended his officers&#8217; handling of the student protests when speaking with media Sunday. &#8220;Even after considering the protesters were unarmed, I believe it is important to consider that many others were injured as a result of their acts,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>On Sunday afternoon, several democratic legislators were arrested for &ldquo;obstructing police in the detainment of audio equipment&rdquo; at one of the steel barriers, according to the Hong Kong Student Federation. That same organization donned black T-shirts with the English phrase, in green letters, &#8220;Freedom Now!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Layla Chang, an 18-year-old university student, said she didn&#8217;t feel she could leave the main protest site even if she tried, since the police had blocking all entrances and exits, and the throngs have amassed to intractable numbers outside. &#8220;We are very afraid but we can&#8217;t leave now,&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n<p>Early on, the sprawl had a typically Hong Kong sense of order, with volunteers organizing the collection and sorting of waste, and medical groups erecting tents to treat protestors for exhaustion and pepper spray. Plastic wrap, to guard against the latter, was doled out by organizers. Protesters caught quick naps under the shade of blue and red tents and hunted for snacks in the piles of bread, bananas, cookies and water that volunteers had dropped off. Yellow ribbons, a longstanding symbol of demands for universal suffrage, were wound around police barricades. At one, dozens of umbrellas were fanned to protect against the use of pepper spray.<\/p>\n<p>In a surreal scene, at a park just a few hundred yards from the protests, a small group of elderly folk listened to mandarin songs celebrating the coming 65th anniversary of the founding of the People&#8217;s Republic of China.<\/p>\n<p>Audrey Eu, chairman of the Civic Party, a leading democratic party in Hong Kong, told TIME that though she thought it &ldquo;unlikely&rdquo; Beijing would reverse its position on the 2017 elections, the protests would go a long way toward galvanizing pro-democracy sentiment and heralding future change. &#8220;This is a broad-based movement,&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;The people of Hong Kong need to stand up and defend one country, two systems,&rdquo; she said by a police barricade, protective ski goggles perched on her head. She had brought her sleeping bag for a possible &#8220;long wait.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m prepared to be arrested,&rdquo; Jimmy Lai, a prominent Hong Kong publisher and critic of the Beijing government, told reporters, as he sat down in front of a row of police on Sunday morning, wearing a plastic white raincoat and pair of goggles.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;If you persist in resistance, there is always hope,&rdquo; he told TIME. &ldquo;If you give up, there is no hope.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Gemma Yim, 21, a university student sitting behind Lai, said she was not prepared to go home anytime soon and would stay at least until all those demonstrators arrested Saturday were released.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We just want to go step by step,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Right now, I don&#8217;t know what we can do but go on strike.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>At around 8 p.m., police announced they had released Joshua Wong, the leader of the Scholarism student activist group, who was arrested Friday for his role in the earlier disturbances. The 17-year-old vowed to join the demonstrations after taking a shower and rest at home.<\/p>\n<p>May Wong, a 55-year-old NGO employee, pledged to stay on the streets all night if necessary. &#8220;As a Hong Kong citizen, we need to support the students,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We support what they support &mdash; universal suffrage.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>But by 11.15 p.m., Occupy Central co-organiser Chan Kin-man urged the protesters to retreat, fearing bloodshed. &#8220;It is a matter of life and death,&#8221; he <a href=\"http:\/\/www.scmp.com\/article\/1603331\/live-tear-gas-fired-protesters-students-demand-cy-leungs-resignation\" target=\"_blank\">told<\/a> the <em>South China Morning Post.<\/em> &#8220;We put people&#8217;s safety as our top priority.

Over 18,000 people had been assigned free tickets via a lottery, after more than 30,000 applied to attend. Inside, as the crowd settled in, big screens above the stage flashed stylized portraits of Modi looking out into the far distance that resembled Shepard Fairey&rsquo;s 2008 &ldquo;Hope&rdquo; poster of Barack Obama. Many in the audience wore T-shirts bearing the same image. Accompanying the crowd was a contingent of American lawmakers: New Jersey Democrat and Senate Foreign Relations Committee chair Sen. Bob Menendez was there, along with over three dozen Congressional colleagues, and also the Indian American Republican governor of South Carolina, Nikki Haley.<\/p>\n<p>Organized by a newly-established group called the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pmvisit.org\" target=\"_blank\">Indian American Community Foundation<\/a>, the whole affair had the feel of an election rally or party convention&mdash;so much so that, at one stage, as the crowd anticipated the Prime Minister&rsquo;s arrival by chanting his name, one of the MCs light-heartedly reminded the audience that Modi had already been elected.<\/p>\n<p>His entrance after a series of musical and dance warm-up acts sent the audience into a frenzy. In his speech, delivered from a rotating platform, Modi reiterated his campaign promises to fix India&rsquo;s ailing economy, and announced measures to simplify visa procedures for foreigners of Indian descent. &ldquo;Since taking over, I haven&rsquo;t even taken a 15-minute vacation,&rdquo; he said, drawing yet more cheers.<\/p>\n<p>It was a date nearly ten years in the making. In 2005, Modi, then chief minister of the western Indian state of Gujarat, was preparing to travel to the U.S. to address Indian Americans from the same New York stage, when the Bush Administration slammed the door shut in his face. The U.S. denied him a diplomatic visa, and yanked his existing non-diplomatic visa under a law barring entry to any foreign government official &ldquo;who was responsible for or directly carried out, at any time, particularly severe violations of religious freedom,&rdquo; pointing to the <a href=\"http:\/\/2001-2009.state.gov\/p\/sca\/rls\/rm\/2005\/43701.htm\" target=\"_blank\">bloody sectarian rioting in Gujarat<\/a> on his watch in 2002. His absence at the Madison Square Garden event was marked with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ndtv.com\/article\/india\/not-an-empty-chair-but-pm-modi-live-sweet-revenge-for-indians-in-new-york-597563\" target=\"_blank\">an empty chair<\/a> on the podium<\/p>\n<p>But then, in May this year, the BJP forcefully shoved a Congress Party-led coalition off the seat of power in Delhi. General elections gave the Hindu nationalists the biggest single-party parliamentary majority in three decades, a feat which firmly established Modi as the biggest beast on the national scene. The Congress, blamed for a raft of high profile corruption scandals and for steering the economy into a ditch, was consigned to the political undergrowth. A invitation to the White House soon followed&mdash;Modi heads to Washington D.C. on Monday&mdash;and the visa ban was conveniently forgotten.<\/p>\n<p>And so, quite apart from what it means for Indo-U.S. ties, this week&rsquo;s visit marks &ldquo;the culmination of the re-imagination of Narendra Modi, from someone who was denied entry onto US soil to a leader who is being feted by the New York and Washington D.C. establishment,&rdquo; says Milan Viashnav, an associate with the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment of International Peace.<\/p>\n<p>The size of the Madison Square Garden rally might also prove politically useful as Modi meets President Barack Obama, says Viashnav. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a politically savvy move. It sends the message that, in addition to a very large support base back home, Modi also has supporters in the U.S. It says to the American government, look, I have a constituency among your voters, not just mine.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>But the hype and excitement isn&rsquo;t just about Modi, says Devesh Kapur, the director of the Center for the Advanced Study of India at the University of Pennsylvania. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a signal from the Indian American community that it has &lsquo;arrived.&rsquo; There&rsquo;s a part of it which is about Modi, the rock star politician. But it&rsquo;s also a signal by the community to the politicians here in the U.S. to take them seriously.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Not that everyone is celebrating Modi&rsquo;s visit. While the audience inside cheered and applauded him, a small group of protestors outside Madison Square Garden on Sunday chanted anti-Modi slogans, questioning his record on religious minorities. And last week, shortly before he touched down in the U.S., a New York court<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2014\/09\/27\/world\/asia\/us-court-issues-summons-to-modi-in-lawsuit-over-2002-riots.html\" target=\"_blank\"> issued a summons<\/a> for him to respond to lawsuit accusing him of rights abuses connected to the 2002 Gujarat riots. Though officials from both India and the U.S. stressed that he had immunity as a visiting head of government, the summons was an awkward reminder of Modi&rsquo;s controversial past as the White House prepared to roll out the red carpet for the new Indian leader.<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3442490\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"World","slug":"world","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/world\/","description":"The latest news and analysis from TIME's correspondents on world politics, diplomacy, conflict, culture, humanitarian disasters, religion and much more"},"tag":{"name":"India","slug":"india","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tag\/india\/"},"tags":"India","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"http:\/\/i1.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/149bc253277f496c888f15e9680a8606-0.jpg?crop=613px%2C455px%2C605px%2C605px&resize=100%2C100","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/149bc253277f496c888f15e9680a8606-0.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/149bc253277f496c888f15e9680a8606-0.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/149bc253277f496c888f15e9680a8606-0.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/149bc253277f496c888f15e9680a8606-0.jpg?w=1100"},"credit":"Jason DeCrow\u2014AP","caption":"Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India waves to the crowd as he arrives to give a speech during a reception by the Indian community in honor of his visit to the United States at Madison Square Garden, Sept. 28, 2014, in New York.

No, Really. <span>Huffington Post<\/span><\/a><\/div><\/aside><p>Interviewed by the filmmaker Eugene Jarecki, Assange discussed digital analogues to the shops and services in the old town square: banks, stores, post offices and libraries.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I am in some ways,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;just a simple librarian who&rsquo;s very good at saying no.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>However, as his self-appointed WikiLeaks title of editor in chief suggests, he&rsquo;s also a publisher. And from inside the Ecuadorean embassy, he&rsquo;s found it very hard to carry out that role. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t physically meet sources,&rdquo; he said, noting that this makes for a particular challenge when dealing with others who are also confined in some way, like Ai WeiWei, who cannot leave China.<\/p>\n<p>Labels that Assange will not accept for himself include &ldquo;vigilante&rdquo; and &ldquo;martyr.&rdquo; He says he made his decision to leak the controversial Chelsea Manning papers with a level head, predicting that it would be &ldquo;a hard time for maybe five to seven years,&rdquo; but that there will be some benefits to his risk. Four years later, he stands by that decision.<\/p>\n<p>He believes the Tim Berners-Lee&rsquo;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2014\/sep\/28\/tim-berners-lee-internet-bill-of-rights-greater-privacy\">recent<\/a> call for a Magna Carta of the Internet &ldquo;probably should be done,&rdquo; but he is skeptical that we can actually reach international consensus. &ldquo;We will create norms as norms have always been created in the past,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;not mainly by belief, not mainly be desire, but by action.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Assange discussed his new book, <em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.orbooks.com\/catalog\/when-google-met-wikileaks\/\">When Google Met WikiLeaks<\/a><\/em>, and noted that Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt&rsquo;s book, <em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/How-Google-Works-Eric-Schmidt\/dp\/1455582344\/\">How Google Works<\/a><\/em>, has also come out this week. &ldquo;If you see Eric Schmidt&rsquo;s book, the cover of it is remarkably similar to the cover of <em>this<\/em> book,&rdquo; he said, brandishing a hologram version of his own. &ldquo;So similar that I&rsquo;m not sure the timing was a coincidence in publication.&rdquo; Both covers are inspired by Google&rsquo;s iconic homepage.<\/p>\n<p>Google, Assange says, would pass itself off as a company of &ldquo;fluffy graduate students,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;not even a company at all, but something that gives free services.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a normal company, just like other normal companies in the U.S. It should be seen as a normal company.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>However, Google differs from other &lsquo;normal&rsquo; companies, he says, in its project to &ldquo;collect as much information about the world as is possible, store it, index it, make predictive models about people&rsquo;s interests, and use that to sell advertising.&rdquo; This, he says, is &ldquo;basically what the National Security Agency is doing.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>When an audience member posed a question about Europe&rsquo;s ruling that citizens have a &lsquo;right to be forgotten&rsquo; by Google, Assange said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think the actual right to be forgotten itself is very interesting so I&rsquo;m not going to talk about that.&rdquo; But he is interested in the power dynamics of the case, arguing that the E.U. has recognized that Google is not just &ldquo;something like a publisher,&rdquo; but due to its enormous size and influence, is &ldquo;more something like a government.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Assange and Jarecki closed the talk with a hologram high-five.<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3442834\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"World","slug":"world","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/world\/","description":"The latest news and analysis from TIME's correspondents on world politics, diplomacy, conflict, culture, humanitarian disasters, religion and much more"},"tags":"Julian Assange|WikiLeaks","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"http:\/\/i0.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/assange-hologram.jpeg?crop=1836px%2C534px%2C408px%2C408px&resize=100%2C100","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/assange-hologram.jpeg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/assange-hologram.jpeg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/assange-hologram.jpeg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/assange-hologram.jpeg?w=1100"},"credit":"Meghan Brosnan","caption":"Julian Assange appears by hologram at The Nantucket Project on Sept. 28, 2014, alongside Eugene Jarecki.","alt":""},"id":3442834,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3442834%2Fjulian-assange-hologram%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fp5HMd-erDA","encoded_title":"Julian+Assange+Speaks+in+Nantucket%E2%80%94As+a+Hologram","video":{"title":"Julian Assange Speaks in Nantucket\u2014As a Hologram","embed":"<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-pos=\"3\"><object id=\"bc-video-3810992171001-3\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#000000\"><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"1847503743001\"><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/wp.me\/p5HMd-erDA\"><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"TIME_onTemplateLoad\"><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"TIME_onTemplateReady\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"><param name=\"htmlFallback\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"3810992171001\"><\/object><\/div>","align":null},"twitter_text":"Julian%20Assange%20speaks%20in%20Nantucket%E2%80%94as%20a%20hologram","twitter_via":"TIMEWorld","ads":{"neg":"false","post_title":"Julian Assange Speaks in Nantucket\u2014As a Hologram"},"Partner_Module":{"partner":"Select","post_title":"Julian Assange Speaks in Nantucket\u2014As a Hologram"},"email_title":"Julian%20Assange%20Speaks%20in%20Nantucket%E2%80%94As%20a%20Hologram%20%7C%20TIME","email_body":"Julian%20Assange%20Speaks%20in%20Nantucket%E2%80%94As%20a%20Hologram%0A%0AThe%20face%20of%20WikiLeaks%20spoke%20about%20Google%2C%20martyrs%20and%20political%20asylum%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3442834%2Fjulian-assange-hologram%2F","icon":"video","omniture":{"modules":"rr-taboola-video|rr-partner|rr-ad"}},{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/3442480\/jeter-leaves-with-hit-and-9-5-win-over-red-sox\/","right_now":true,"shortlink":"http:\/\/wp.me\/p5HMd-erxS","title":"Jeter Leaves With Hit and 9-5 Win Over Red Sox","post_type":"post","time_article":true,"comments_allowed":true,"short_title":"Jeter Leaves With Hit and 9-5 Win Over Red Sox","format":"brief","time":{"pretty":"Sept. 28, 2014","published":"2014-09-28 18:05:33","updated":"2014-09-28 22:05:33","minute":"6:05 pm","short":"9\/28"},"authors":[{"id":193865,"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/author\/associated-press\/","name":"Associated Press","bio":"","short_bio":"","types":[],"twitter":"","twitter_url":"","gplus":"","fb":"","email":"","thumbnail":null,"contributor":false}],"content":"<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-taboola-video\" data-name=\"rr-taboola-video\"><div id=\"taboola-right-rail-organic-video-3442480\" class=\"taboola\" data-mode=\"verticalx3\" data-placement=\"right-rail-organic\" data-type=\"video\"><\/div><\/aside><p>(BOSTON) &mdash;

It&#8217;s almost hard to believe,&#8221; commissioner Bud Selig said this weekend when he stopped by Fenway for his own farewell tour. &#8220;He makes one proud.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Three days after an emotional farewell in New York, pinstripe-wearing fans filled Fenway Park for Jeter&#8217;s finale, chanting for him and the visiting Yankees and standing for each of his at-bats. After a hard line-drive out in the first inning, Jeter delivered his final hit as part of a four-run third inning, then left for a pinch hitter and headed into retirement.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m ready for it now,&#8221; Jeter said after the final out. &#8220;The plan was two at-bats. I was lucky I got a hit. I guess I hit the right part of the plate.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Jeter&#8217;s departure gave some import to an otherwise meaningless game between the longtime AL East rivals, who missed the playoffs together for the first time in 20 years. The last-place Red Sox &mdash; the defending World Series champions &mdash; are the first team in baseball history to go from worst to first and back to worst in three consecutive seasons.<\/p>\n<p>Michael Pineda (5-5) earned the victory as the Yankees finished in second place, 12 games behind the division-winning Baltimore Orioles and too far back in the wild-card standings to make the weekend series count. Clay Buchholz (8-11) gave up Ichiro Suzuki&#8217;s two-run triple before in the fourth, then entered trivia history as the last pitcher to give up a hit to Jeter.<\/p>\n<p>After a walk and a single and a wild pitch put runners on second and third, Suzuki lined the ball into the Fenway triangle, the deepest part of the ballpark, where it rolled under the 420-foot sign and stopped. Fans moaned that he was not waved home for an inside-the-park homer, but with Ichiro at third it meant that Jeter would be coming to bat with another RBI opportunity.<\/p>\n<p>The 40-year-old shortstop, in the lineup this weekend as the designated hitter, took a strike, took a ball and then fouled one off before bouncing a high chopper to third. Garin Cecchini, 23, tried to make a one-handed play but couldn&#8217;t.<\/p>\n<p>All eyes turned to the Jeter, safe at first, waiting to see if that was it. And when Brian McCann came out of the dugout to replace him as a pinch runner, the Captain&#8217;s career was over &mdash; 46 years to the day after Mickey Mantle ended his on the same field. The final hit raised Jeter&#8217;s lifetime batting average to .310.<\/p>\n<p>Jeter pointed at the applauding Red Sox, hugged pitcher Clay Buchholz and then stopped in front of the Yankees dugout to tip his helmet to the crowd. Buchholz waited behind the mound to give the cheers a chance to subside, and then Jeter disappeared into the dugout.<\/p>\n<p>The Yankees scored five more in the top of the seventh inning and Boston put five across in the bottom half, but by that time the ballpark was half-empty.<\/p>\n<p>The fans had gotten what they wanted.<\/p>\n<p>The sun-soaked day began with a 30-minute ceremony in which Jeter was serenaded with &#8220;Respect&#8221; and presented with some local baubles: Second base emblazoned with his No. 2, a pair of Yankees-themed boots and a check for $22,222.22 to his Turn 2 Foundation. Former Red Sox players from Carl Yastrzemski to Fred Lynn came out to greet him along with captains from the other local teams: Bruins Hall of Famer Bobby Orr, the Celtics&#8217; Paul Pierce and Troy Brown of the Patriots, followed by the entire 2014 Red Sox team.<\/p>\n<p>Jeter&#8217;s parents made the trip for his final series, along with thousands of New Yorkers who clogged the MassPike on their way to the game. Fans in Jeter&#8217;s No. 2 pinstripes milled unharassed inside the ballpark &mdash; a scene unimaginable a decade ago &mdash; mixing with Bostonians showing their esteem for a player who relished the rivalry as much as they do.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;JETUH,&#8221; said one T-shirt in Red Sox colors and his name translated into the local dialect.<\/p>\n<p>And on the back: &#8220;WICKED RE2PECT.&#8221;<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3442480\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"Sports","slug":"sports","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/sports\/","description":"Where sports is on the mind.

Ortega-Hernandez, fired at least seven bullets into the house&#8217;s upstairs residence 700 yards across the South Lawn, and to the attack.<\/p>\n<p>President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama were away during that weekend, but their younger daughter, Sasha, was in the White House, the <em>Post<\/em> reports, and their older daughter, Malia, was expected home any minute.<\/p>\n<p>While Secret Service officers rushed to respond to the shots, a call came from the supervisor on duty: no shots fired, stand down. The officers complied, even as Ortega sped away from the scene at 60 mph. The supervisor apparently believed the noise had been a construction vehicle backfiring.<\/p>\n<p>Although it acknowledged later that night that shots had been fired in the vicinity, the agency initially suggested they had come from a gang gunfight near the front lawn of the White House, and not from a deliberate attack.<\/p>\n<p>It took more than four days for the Secret Service to piece together that shots had hit the White House, and only then because a housekeeper noticed the damage. The Secret Service did not interview key witnesses until days later, when the bullets were found, and only conducted a superficial inspection of the White House for damage.<\/p>\n<p>The Obamas were only made aware of the shooting when an assistant White House usher told the First Lady about the bullet holes another housekeeper had found. The officers who believed shots had hit the White House were either ignored or afraid to contradict their superiors.<\/p>\n<p>Ortega was eventually arrested and sentenced to 25 years in prison.

black teenager in Ferguson, Mo. last month exposed the &#8220;gulf of mistrust&#8221; that exists between law enforcement and local residents in many communities.<\/p>\n<p>Speaking at the Congressional Black Caucus awards dinner, the President said that the shooting of Michael Brown by a police officer in the St Louis suburb &#8220;awakened our nation once again to the reality that people in this room have long understood, which is, in too many communities around the country, a gulf of mistrust exists between local residents and law enforcement.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"a\"><span class=\"l8\"><span class=\"l9\">Statistically, the President noted, blacks in the United States are targeted at a substantially higher rate than whites in their cars and on the street, and more likely to get the death penalty. &#8220;To<span class=\"a\">o many young men of color feel targeted by law e<\/span><span class=\"a\">nforcement, guilty of walking while black, or driving <\/span><span class=\"a\">while black, judged by stereotypes that fuel fear and <\/span><span class=\"a\">resentment <span class=\"l8\">and <span class=\"l9\">hopelessness.&#8221;<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"a\">&#8220;And that has a corrosive effect&mdash;not just on the <\/span><span class=\"a\">black <span class=\"l6\">community; it <span class=\"l11\">has <span class=\"l6\">a <span class=\"l6\">corrosive effect <span class=\"l11\">on America,&#8221; Obama continued.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"a\">To reverse the widening gap between minority communities and the people who police them, said Obama, &#8220;we need to help communities and law <\/span><span class=\"a\">enforcement build trust, build understanding, so that our <\/span><span class=\"a\">neighborhoods stay safe and our young people stay on <\/span><span class=\"a\">track.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Obama&#8217;s remarks Saturday came nearly two months after the shooting of Brown sparked a week of sometimes violent protests in Ferguson and outrage around the country at the local police&#8217;s handling of the situation.<\/p>\n<p>You can read the speech below:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<form

As the officer approached, the men ran away. When the officer gave chase, &#8220;one of the men turned and shot,&#8221; Belmar said.<\/p>\n<p>The officer was shot in the arm and is expected to survive, he said. Belmar did not identify the officer or give further details about his condition. He said the officer returned fire but said police have &#8220;no indication&#8221; that either suspect was shot.<\/p>\n<p>A search was underway for the suspects early Sunday in Ferguson, where some community members remain uneasy in the wake of the August shooting death of an unarmed black 18-year-old by a white police officer.<\/p>\n<p>Belmar said he did not think the officer&#8217;s shooting was related to two separate protests about Michael Brown&#8217;s shooting that were going on Saturday night around the same time.<\/p>\n<p>Around midnight at the police station, approximately two dozen officers stood near a group of about 100 protesters who mingled on a street corner, occasionally shouting, &#8220;No justice; no peace.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Nearby, part of a road was closed in town as police conducted a search for the suspects. Numerous law enforcement agencies were responding, and police helicopters were canvassing the area.<\/p>\n<p>The officer&#8217;s shooting comes after Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson issued a videotaped apology to Brown&#8217;s family earlier in the week and attempted to march with protesters, an effort that led to a clash with activists and several arrests on Thursday.<\/p>\n<p>Brown&#8217;s parents told The Associated Press on Saturday they were unmoved by the apology.<\/p>\n<p>Brown&#8217;s mother, Lesley McSpadden, said, &#8220;yes,&#8221; when asked if Jackson should be fired, and his father, Michael Brown Sr., said rather than an apology, they would like to see the officer who shot their son arrested.<\/p>\n<p>A county grand jury is weighing whether to indict Ferguson officer Darren Wilson in Brown&#8217;s shooting.<\/p>\n<p>The Justice Department, which is investigating whether Brown&#8217;s civil rights were violated, is conducting a broader probe into Ferguson police. On Friday, it urged Jackson to ban his officers from wearing bracelets supporting Wilson while on duty and from covering up their name plates with black tape.<\/p>\n<p>Ferguson residents complained about the bracelets, which are black with &#8220;I am Darren Wilson&#8221; in white lettering, at a meeting with federal officials this week.<\/p>\n<p>Brown&#8217;s shooting has also focused attention on the lack of diversity in many police departments across the country. In Ferguson, of 53 officers in a community that is two-thirds black, only three are African-American.<\/p>\n<p>Also early Sunday, not far from Ferguson, an off-duty St. Louis city police officer was injured on Interstate 70 when three suspects fired shots into his personal vehicle, a police spokeswoman said.<\/p>\n<p>Schron Jackson said the officer, who has nearly 20 years of experience, was being treated at a hospital for a minor injury to his arm from broken glass. She said there is no reason to believe the two shootings were related.<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3441507\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"U.S.","slug":"us","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/us\/","description":"The latest news and analysis on crime, religion, education, transportation, weather, immigration, sports, drugs, the law, and other news from around the nation"},"topic":{"name":"Ferguson","slug":"ferguson","left_rail_title":"Ferguson","left_rail_subhead":"More Ferguson Coverage","editor_content":"","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/topic\/ferguson\/","email_title":"Ferguson | TIME","email_body":"Ferguson%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2Ftopic%2Fferguson%2F","encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F%2F3394150%2Fuber-military%2F%3Futm_content%3Dbuffer613c4%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com%26utm_campaign%3Dbuffer","encoded_shortlink":"","twitter_text":"","encoded_title":"Ferguson"},"tag":{"name":"Crime","slug":"crime","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tag\/crime\/"},"tags":"Crime","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"http:\/\/i0.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/fergusoon-police-shot.jpg?crop=1347px%2C324px%2C583px%2C583px&resize=100%2C100","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/fergusoon-police-shot.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/fergusoon-police-shot.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/fergusoon-police-shot.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/fergusoon-police-shot.jpg?w=1100"},"credit":"Christian Gooden\u2014AP","caption":"Missouri State Highway Patrol troopers stand posted at the corner of Chambers Road and West Florissant Avenue on Sept. 27, 2014, in Ferguson, Mo., as police search for a suspect in the shooting of a Ferguson police officer.

Four victims were flown down Sunday, and rescuers returned to 3,067-meter (10,062-foot) Mt. Ontake on Monday morning to recover the remaining 27.<\/p>\n<p>Scenes broadcast live on Japanese TV station TBS showed soldiers carrying yellow body bags one-by-one to a camouflage military helicopter that had landed in a relatively wide-open area of the now bleak landscape, its rotors still spinning.<\/p>\n<p>The first bodies were flown to a nearby athletic field, its green grass and surrounding forested hills contrasting with Mt. Ontake&#8217;s ash-gray peak in the background, a reduced plume still emerging from its crater.<\/p>\n<p>There, they were transferred to white police vans, while two dozen officers struggled to hold up long blue tarps under the spinning rotors, blocking the view from the media.<\/p>\n<p>The four brought down Sunday have been confirmed dead, said Takehiko Furukoshi, a Nagano prefecture crisis-management official.<\/p>\n<p>The 27 others are listed as having heart and lung failure, the customary way for Japanese authorities to describe a body until police doctors can examine it.<\/p>\n<p>Saturday&#8217;s eruption was the first fatal one in modern times at Mount Ontake, a popular climbing destination 210 kilometers (130 miles) west of Tokyo on the main Japanese island of Honshu. A similar eruption occurred in 1979, but no one died.<\/p>\n<p>Japanese media reported that some of the bodies were found in a lodge near the summit and that others were buried in ash up to 50 centimeters (20 inches) deep. Police said only two of the four confirmed dead had been identified. Both were men, ages 23 and 45.<\/p>\n<p>Mount Ontake erupted shortly before noon at perhaps the worst possible time, with at least 250 people taking advantage of a beautiful fall Saturday to go for a hike. The blast spewed large white plumes of gas and ash high into the sky, blotted out the midday sun and blanketed the surrounding area in ash.<\/p>\n<p>Hundreds were initially trapped on the slopes, though most made their way down by Saturday night.<\/p>\n<p>About 40 people who were stranded overnight came down on Sunday. Many were injured, and some had to be rescued by helicopters or carried down on stretchers. By nightfall, all the injured had been brought down, officials said.<\/p>\n<p>Japan&#8217;s Fire and Disaster Management Agency tallied 37 injured people and said it was trying to update the number still missing.<\/p>\n<p>Furukoshi said rescuers gave priority to helping the survivors come down, leaving behind those who were obviously without hope.<\/p>\n<p>Survivors told Japanese media that they were pelted by rocks. One man said he and others went into the basement of a lodge, fearing that the rocks would penetrate the roof.

The Khorasan Group is a cell of militants that the U.S. says is plotting attacks against the West in cooperation with the Nusra front, Syria&#8217;s al-Qaeda affiliate. Both groups have been targeted by U.S. airstrikes in recent days; together they constitute the most significant military opposition to Assad, whose government the U.S. would like to see gone.<\/p>\n<p>Obama said his first priority is degrading the extremists who are threatening Iraq and the West. To defeat them, he acknowledged, would require a competent local ground force, something no analyst predicts will surface any time soon in Syria, despite U.S. plans to arm and train &#8220;moderate&#8221; rebels. The U.S. has said it would not cooperate with the Assad government.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Right now, we&#8217;ve got a campaign plan that has a strong chance for success in Iraq,&#8221; the president said. &#8220;Syria is a more challenging situation.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Earlier Sunday, House Speaker John Boehner questioned Obama&#8217;s strategy to destroy the Islamic State group. Boehner said on ABC&#8217;s &#8220;This Week&#8221; that the U.S. may have &#8220;no choice&#8221; but to send in American troops if the mix of U.S.-led airstrikes and a ground campaign reliant on Iraqi forces, Kurdish fighters and moderate Syrian rebels fails to achieve that goal.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We have no choice,&#8221; Boehner said. &#8220;These are barbarians. They intend to kill us. And if we don&#8217;t destroy them first, we&#8217;re going to pay the price.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Obama, though, made clear he has no interest in a major U.S. ground presence beyond the 1,600 American advisers and special operations troops he already has ordered to Iraq.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We are assisting Iraq in a very real battle that&#8217;s taking place on their soil, with their troops,&#8221; the president said. &#8220;This is not America against ISIL. This is America leading the international community to assist a country with whom we have a security partnership.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Only the U.S. could lead such a campaign, Obama said.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;When there&#8217;s a typhoon in the Philippines, take a look at who&#8217;s helping the Philippines deal with that situation,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When there&#8217;s an earthquake in Haiti, take a look at who&#8217;s leading the charge and making sure Haiti can rebuild. That&#8217;s how how we roll. And that&#8217;s what makes this America.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;60 Minutes&#8221; interviewer Steve Kroft asked Obama how the threat emanating from Syria and Iraq squares with the president&#8217;s longstanding position that al-Qaeda&#8217;s leadership has been &#8220;decimated.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;You had an international network in al-Qaeda between Afghanistan and Pakistan, headed by bin Laden. And that structure we have rendered ineffective,&#8221; Obama said. &#8220;But what I also said .. .is that you have regional groups with regional ambitions and territorial ambitions. And what also has not changed is the kind of violent, ideologically driven extremism that has taken root in too much of the Muslim world.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>While an &#8220;overwhelming majority of Muslims are peaceful,&#8221; Obama said, &#8220;in the Muslim world right now, there is a cancer that has grown for too long that suggests that it is acceptable to kill innocent people who worship a different God. And that kind of extremism, unfortunately, means that we&#8217;re going to see for some time the possibility that in a whole bunch of different countries, radical groups may spring up, particularly in countries that are still relatively fragile, where you had sectarian tensions, where you don&#8217;t have a strong state security apparatus.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>But &#8220;rather than play whack-a-mole and send U.S. troops wherever this occurs, we have to build strong partnerships,&#8221; Obama said. &#8220;We have to get the international community to recognize this is a problem. We&#8217;ve got to get Arab and Muslim leaders to say very clearly: &#8216;These folks do not represent us. They do not represent Islam.'&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Asked how Islamic State fighters had come to control so much territory in Syria and Iraq, Obama acknowledged that U.S. intelligence agencies underestimated the threat and overestimated the ability and will of Iraq&#8217;s army to fight.<\/p>\n<p>Obama said he agreed with his director of national intelligence, James Clapper, who acknowledged that the U.S. &#8220;underestimated what had been taking place in Syria.&#8221; Obama also said it was &#8220;absolutely true&#8221; that the U.S. overestimated the ability and will of the Iraqi army.<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3443223\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"U.S.","slug":"us","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/us\/","description":"The latest news and analysis on crime, religion, education, transportation, weather, immigration, sports, drugs, the law, and other news from around the nation"},"tag":{"name":"Syria","slug":"syria","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tag\/syria\/"},"tags":"Al-Qaida|Bashar Assad|Foreign Policy|isis|President Obama|Syria","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"http:\/\/i2.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/mideast-syria_wong.jpg?crop=615px%2C449px%2C410px%2C410px&resize=100%2C100","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/mideast-syria_wong.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/mideast-syria_wong.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/mideast-syria_wong.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/mideast-syria_wong.jpg?w=1100"},"credit":"Syrian Observatory for Human Rights\u2014AP","caption":"Syrians walk amid the rubble of damaged houses following a Syrian government air strike in Aleppo, Syria, on Sept. 27 2014","alt":"Mideast Syria"},"id":3443223,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3443223%2Fcontradictory-syria-policy-helps-assad%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fp5HMd-erJR","encoded_title":"%E2%80%98Contradictory%E2%80%99+Syria+Policy+Helps+Assad","twitter_text":"%27Contradictory%27%20Syria%20policy%20helps%20Assad","twitter_via":"TIME","ads":{"neg":"false","post_title":"'Contradictory' Syria Policy Helps Assad"},"Partner_Module":{"partner":"Select","post_title":"'Contradictory' Syria Policy Helps Assad"},"email_title":"%E2%80%98Contradictory%E2%80%99%20Syria%20Policy%20Helps%20Assad%20%7C%20TIME","email_body":"%E2%80%98Contradictory%E2%80%99%20Syria%20Policy%20Helps%20Assad%0A%0AObama%20said%20his%20first%20priority%20is%20degrading%20the%20extremists%20who%20are%20threatening%20Iraq%20and%20the%20West.%20To%20defeat%20them%2C%20he%20acknowledged%2C%20would%20require%20a%20competent%20local%20ground%20force%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3443223%2Fcontradictory-syria-policy-helps-assad%2F","omniture":{"modules":"rr-taboola-video|rr-partner|rr-mag|rr-ad"}},{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/3432718\/review-the-simpsons-death\/","shortlink":"http:\/\/ti.me\/YjFy0i","title":"<i>The Simpsons<\/i> Watch: Heaven, I&#8217;m in Jewish Heaven","post_type":"post","time_article":true,"comments_allowed":true,"short_title":"<i>The Simpsons<\/i> Watch: Heaven, I&#8217;m in Jewish Heaven","excerpt":"In a much-hyped <i>Simpsons<\/i> episode, one character dies and another one tries to figure out life","format":"article","time":{"pretty":"Sept. 28, 2014","published":"2014-09-28 22:04:20","updated":"2014-09-29 02:04:20","minute":"10:04 pm","short":"9\/28"},"authors":[{"id":208177548,"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/author\/james-poniewozik\/","name":"James Poniewozik","bio":"James Poniewozik is TIME magazine's TV critic and writes the Tuned In column, about pop culture, media, and society.

Is it resonant? Does it close the character&#8217;s story well? And&#8211;let&#8217;s be frank here&#8211;did it actually live up to the hype?<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s possible that on that last score, the death of Rabbi Hyman Krustofski (voiced again by the great, gravelly Jackie Mason) will disappoint those amateur Reapers who were laying odds that Krusty would be leaving us, largely on the basis of the episode title, &#8220;Clown in the Dumps.&#8221; It wasn&#8217;t an Earth-shattering death&#8211;and I&#8217;m glad, if it means Krusty lives to peddle <em>trayf<\/em> another day. Because overhyped or not, the episode showed that Krusty is valuable to <em>The Simpsons<\/em>, not just for the showbiz jokes, but as an entree to a certain kind of story about disappointment and living with one&#8217;s limitations.<\/p>\n<p>If &#8220;Clown in the Dumps&#8221; is not a classic on the level of season three&#8217;s &#8220;Like Father, Like Clown,&#8221; it was still a fitting, sweet conclusion to the story of Hyman and Herschel. There has always been a special darkness to Krusty&#8217;s stories&#8211;as Lisa once said, he&#8217;s like a black-velvet painting come to life&#8211;and it&#8217;s been rooted in both running from and aching for the approval of his father.<\/p>\n<p>In a TV-sitcom medium that often <a href=\"http:\/\/entertainment.time.com\/2009\/08\/31\/robo-james-time-machine-how-tv-taught-me-to-be-jewish\/\" target=\"_blank\">ignores Jewish experience or writes it in as subtext<\/a>, that relationship and its details were something special. And there was a brilliant absurdity to leaving Krusty with that Talmudic, torturously ambiguous &#8220;Eh&#8221;&#8211;that most malleable of Jewish judgments&#8211;leaving Krusty to decide, on his own, whether his life has been worth it.<\/p>\n<p>What does the &#8220;Eh&#8221; mean? Over time&#8211;with the help of a whiskey funnel, a dream sequence and a comedy rabbi&#8211;Krusty finds an answer: that his father really approved of him, even if he could never express it. It&#8217;s an answer; it&#8217;s not the answer, which Krusty will never get any more than the rest of us will. There may be other answers, maybe even more believable ones (as Lisa suggests, that the rabbi didn&#8217;t care for his son&#8217;s delivery), but they don&#8217;t really matter. The solution&#8211;the episode suggests with understated profundity&#8211;is in taking the effort to try to find the answer, not in the answer itself.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the episode tried to parallel the rabbi&#8217;s death with the Simpson family by having Lisa become justifiably worried about her own father&#8217;s health. It&#8217;s heavy stuff, but not too heavy, historically, for The Simpsons. (The first time Homer&#8217;s mortality was connected with the rabbi was in &#8220;Homer&#8217;s Triple Bypass,&#8221; back in season four.) There was a lot of potential in linking an older child&#8217;s acceptance of his father&#8217;s mortality to a younger child&#8217;s just becoming aware of it. But as for the execution and payoff of the subplot? Eh. Krusty was the star of the show this time out.<\/p>\n<p>And as for you, Rabbi Krustovski, we&#8217;ll see you in non-existent Jewish Heaven.

He was born and raised in the Lower East Side of Springfield, where he became &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.springfieldspringfield.co.uk\/view_episode_scripts.php?episode=s03e06\" target=\"_blank\">the most respected man<\/a>&#8221; in the community. It was there that he raised a son, Herschel.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Rabbi Krustofski intended for his son to <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Like_Father,_Like_Clown\" target=\"_blank\">become a rabbi<\/a> like himself and Herschel&#8217;s grandfather, but the boy&#8217;s desire to become a clown came between the two. Herschel grew up to become Krusty the Clown, a figure of joy to kids in the town of Springfield (State Still TBD) and beyond. But the Krustofskis were estranged for many years, and only reunited with the help of a couple local children: Bart and Lisa Simpson.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Late in life, Krustofski <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Today_I_Am_a_Clown\" target=\"_blank\">reunited with his son again<\/a> when Krusty decided to finally have his Bar Mitzvah. But the rabbi was again disappointed by his son when, after Hyman taught his son about Judaism, Krusty decision to televise the event, in a comeback bid after his show was canceled.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Although &#8220;Krusty the Klown&#8217;s Wet &#8216;n&#8217; Wild Bar Mitzvah&#8221; was a hit, it again damaged relations between the pair. But Krusty finally decided to have a second, more traditional Bar Mitzvah at a Jewish temple, to the delight of his father. The rabbi was also due to preside over his son&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Once_Upon_a_Time_in_Springfield\" target=\"_blank\">15th wedding<\/a>, to &#8220;Princess Penelope,&#8221; until Krusty ditched her at the altar.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Rabbi Krustofski&#8217;s fate had been in question ever since <em>Simpsons<\/em> producer Al Jean said during a publicity tour last year that a character would meet his maker in the season opener. &#8220;I&#8217;ll give you a clue that the actor playing the character won an Emmy for playing that character, but I won&#8217;t say who it is,&#8221; he said. Mason won the award for playing the role of Krustofski in 1992.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Krustofski is not the first semi-regular character to die in the otherwise ageless universe of <em>The Simpsons<\/em>. He will join Maude Flanders, Bleeding Gums Murphy, Mona Simpson (Homer&#8217;s mom), Amber Simpson (Homer&#8217;s Las Vegas wife), and Edna Krabappel in the Springfield graveyard.<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3442459\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"Entertainment","slug":"entertainment","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/entertainment\/","description":"From esoteric art to Housewives hullaballoo, TIME Culture covers what's good, bad and breaking right now in music, movies, TV, tech, celebrities and style"},"tag":{"name":"Television","slug":"television","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tag\/television\/"},"tags":"Television","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/krusty_01025023_hires1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/krusty_01025023_hires1.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/krusty_01025023_hires1.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/krusty_01025023_hires1.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/krusty_01025023_hires1.jpg?w=1100"},"credit":"FOX","caption":"","alt":"Krusty the Clown The Simpsons Season 26 Premier"},"id":3442459,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3442459%2Fsimpsons-who-died-krustys-dad%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fp5HMd-erxx","encoded_title":"The+Simpsons+Kills+Off+Krusty%E2%80%99s+Dad+in+Season+Premiere","twitter_text":"The%20Simpsons%20Kills%20Off%20Krusty%27s%20Dad%20in%20Season%20Premiere","twitter_via":"TIMECulture","ads":{"neg":"false","post_title":"<i>The Simpsons<\/i> Kills Off Krusty's Dad in Season Premiere"},"Partner_Module":{"partner":"Select","post_title":"<i>The Simpsons<\/i> Kills Off Krusty's Dad in Season Premiere"},"email_title":"The%20Simpsons%20Kills%20Off%20Krusty%E2%80%99s%20Dad%20in%20Season%20Premiere%20%7C%20TIME","email_body":"The%20Simpsons%20Kills%20Off%20Krusty%E2%80%99s%20Dad%20in%20Season%20Premiere%0A%0AAn%20obituary%20for%20the%20father%20of%20beloved%20entertainer%20Krusty%20the%20Clown%2C%20who%20died%20in%20Springfield%20this%20weekend%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3442459%2Fsimpsons-who-died-krustys-dad%2F","omniture":{"modules":"rr-taboola-video|rr-ad"}},{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/3442296\/war-isis-operation-fingers-crossed\/","shortlink":"http:\/\/wp.me\/p5HMd-eruU","title":"The War Against ISIS: <i>Operation Fingers Crossed<\/i>","post_type":"post","time_article":true,"comments_allowed":true,"short_title":"ISIS War: <i>Operation Fingers Crossed<\/i>","excerpt":"History offers a checkered record on its chances of success\r\n","format":"brief","time":{"pretty":"Sept. 28, 2014","published":"2014-09-28 18:28:56","updated":"2014-09-28 22:28:56","minute":"6:28 pm","short":"9\/28"},"authors":[{"id":207018486,"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/author\/mark-thompson\/","name":"Mark Thompson","bio":"Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter Mark Thompson has covered national security and the military since 1979, and for Time since 1994.","short_bio":"","types":[],"twitter":"MarkThompson_DC","twitter_url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/MarkThompson_DC","gplus":"112764608762365853581","fb":"","email":"mark_thompson@timemagazine.com","thumbnail":"http:\/\/i1.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/voss-timeheadshots10final.jpg?crop=1153px%2C163px%2C3178px%2C3178px&resize=100%2C100","contributor":false}],"content":"<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-taboola-video\" data-name=\"rr-taboola-video\"><div id=\"taboola-right-rail-organic-video-3442296\" class=\"taboola\" data-mode=\"verticalx3\" data-placement=\"right-rail-organic\" data-type=\"video\"><\/div><\/aside><p>For more than a week, U.S. and allied warplanes have bombed targets inside Syria every day.

Granted, the airmen involved are at risk, but the nation generally seems to focus on war&mdash;and holds its breath&mdash;only when U.S. ground troops are involved in combat.<\/p>\n<p>For Americans, that&#8217;s a double-edged sword. For sure, it cuts down on the risk to U.S. military personnel. But it also makes accomplishing President Obama&#8217;s declared mission&mdash;the destruction of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria and the Khorasan Group&mdash;tougher to achieve.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s why Pentagon officials have made clear that the aerial campaign is open-ended and likely to be lengthy. Inflicting real pain on the jihadists is going to require ground troops, and U.S. officials say they&#8217;re more than a year away from training the first batch of 5,000 to take on an ISIS force estimated at 30,000.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t see the political strategy, at least a realistic one, in Syria,&#8221; Senator Chris Murphy, D-Conn., told CNN Sunday. &#8220;That begs the question, how long are we going to be there and is there any end? There&rsquo;s just no appetite in the American public for an open-ended military conflict in Syria.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Todd Harrison of the independent Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments <a href=\"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/estimating-the-costs-of-operations-against-isil.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">estimates<\/a> that the cost of the U.S. war against ISIS is approaching $1 billion, and could end up costing $6 billion annually for an aggressive, sustained bombing campaign. While significant, that&#8217;s far less than the roughly $150 billion the U.S. spent during the peak years of the Afghan (2011) and Iraq (2008) wars.<\/p>\n<p>At best, the daily bombing will likely only freeze ISIS&#8217;s grip on eastern Syria. &#8220;Combined with our ongoing efforts in Iraq, these strikes will continue to deny [ISIS] freedom of movement and challenge its ability to plan, direct, and sustain its operations,&#8221; Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel <a href=\"http:\/\/www.defense.gov\/Transcripts\/Transcript.aspx?TranscriptID=5508\" target=\"_blank\">said<\/a> Friday. In western Iraq, reinvigorated Iraqi army and peshmerga forces are more likely to regain ground lost to ISIS over the past year.<\/p>\n<p>Such campaigns have a mixed history. When the U.S. and its allies forced Iraqi forces out of Kuwait in 1991 in Operation Desert Storm, it took a 43-day <a href=\"http:\/\/www.afhso.af.mil\/shared\/media\/document\/AFD-100927-061.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">aerial bombardment<\/a> before ground forces swept in to finish the job.<\/p>\n<p>The 1999 NATO-led air <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rand.org\/content\/dam\/rand\/pubs\/monograph_reports\/MR1365\/MR1365.ch8.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">campaign<\/a> to drive Serbs out of Kosovo in the Balkans, Operation Allied Force, required 28,000 high-explosive munitions. It cost an estimated $3 billion and killed nearly 500 civilians. The 78-day barrage did highlight airpower&#8217;s ability change the reality on the ground.<\/p>\n<p>But both of those examples pitted the U.S. and its allies against organized state militaries commanded by dictators: Saddam Hussein in Iraq, and Slobodan Milosevic in Serbia. As heads of state responsible for far more than battlefields, they were subject to pressures the zealously-driven ISIS is unlikely to feel.<\/p>\n<p>The air war that most closely parallels what the U.S. is now conducting against ISIS is Operation Unified Protector, the U.S.-led seven-month <a href=\"http:\/\/www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil\/pdffiles\/PUB1161.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">effort<\/a> over Libya in 2011. Launched by the U.S., with NATO eventually assuming a larger role, it began as a humanitarian effort to protect Libyan rebels from Muammar Gaddafi&#8217;s army. While air strikes played a critical role in Gaddafi&#8217;s ouster and eventual killing, the country has since been wracked by conflict among its warring factions.<\/p>\n<p>Two years ago, terrorists took advantage of the chaos to attack U.S. diplomatic outposts in Benghazi, killing Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. &#8220;Where you&rsquo;ve got states that are failing or in the midst of civil war, these kinds of organizations thrive,&#8221; Obama told CBS&#8217; 60 Minutes Sunday night, referring to ISIS. But he just as surely could have been speaking of Libya, where the war he launched more than three years ago initially was hailed as a victory for U.S. leadership. Two months ago, the U.S. shuttered its embassy in the Libyan capital of Tripoli and evacuated its diplomats.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The fate of that country has been largely absent from discussions about the new war,&#8221; the <em>New York Times<\/em> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2014\/09\/28\/opinion\/sunday\/dismal-lessons-from-libya-and-yemen.html\" target=\"_blank\">warned<\/a> Sunday, &#8220;which is certain to last longer and unleash a wider array of consequences.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The Pentagon, thus far, has declined to name that new war.<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3442296\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/politics\/","description":"Political insight from the Beltway and beyond.

President Obama&rsquo;s 2009 stimulus bill&mdash;a <a href=\"http:\/\/content.time.com\/time\/magazine\/article\/0,9171,2013826,00.html\" target=\"_blank\">topic<\/a> I&rsquo;ve <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/8362\/economic-stimulus-recovery-act-anniversary-obama\/\" target=\"_blank\">discussed<\/a> at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/New-Deal-Hidden-Story-Change\/dp\/1451642334\/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;sr=&amp;qid\" target=\"_blank\">some length<\/a>&mdash;included $300 billion in tax cuts, mostly for the non-rich. The centerpiece was called Making Work Pay, which provided up to $800 a year for the bottom 95% of working families, and was later converted into a payroll tax credit worth up to $2,136 a year before it expired in 2012. Most stimulus tax cuts were &ldquo;refundable,&rdquo; which meant low-income workers who don&rsquo;t pay income taxes&mdash;the &ldquo;47 percent&rdquo; that Mitt Romney was caught denigrating on video&mdash;would be eligible to benefit. When Obama famously told former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor &ldquo;elections have consequences, Eric, and I won,&rdquo; he was talking about refundable tax cuts for the poor, which House Republicans opposed but could not block.<\/p>\n<p>This extra money for the poor and middle class doesn&rsquo;t show up in charts illustrating how the rich are vacuuming up all the recovery&rsquo;s income and wealth. Those charts and the pundits who love them also tend to ignore the impact of Obama&rsquo;s tax hikes on the rich, especially his repeal of the Bush tax cuts on income over $400,000. In his Times essay, titled &ldquo;America Out of Whack,&rdquo; Edsall speculates at length about the impossibility of redistributive taxation in modern Washington, somehow failing to mention that it just happened in a big way last year. As Zachary Goldfarb calculated for a Washington Post piece on inequality in July, repeal <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/blogs\/wonkblog\/wp\/2014\/07\/23\/dont-think-obama-has-reduced-inequality-these-numbers-prove-that-he-has\/\" target=\"_blank\">cost<\/a> the average member of the top 0.1% income bracket nearly half a million dollars.<\/p>\n<p>Obamacare is also financed by hefty new taxes on the rich, including a 3.8% hike on investment income and a 0.9% hike on earned income above $250,000. But its main push against inequality will be its health benefits for the uninsured and underinsured. Free birth control is just one example. There&rsquo;s also free primary care and other preventive services. Families up to 138% of the poverty line are now eligible for Medicaid benefits in participating states. The law also eliminated the &ldquo;donut hole,&rdquo; reducing drug costs for seniors. None of this will show up in the inequality data, but it all helps make ordinary Americans less financially insecure. And so far, Obamacare insurance premiums have been significantly lower than expected, which means more money in ratepayer pockets. Jason Furman, chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, says the combination of Obamacare plus progressive tax changes has offset a decade&rsquo;s worth of rising inequality.<\/p>\n<p>There are many less memorable ways that public policy has tried to narrow the gap. For example, the stimulus, if you&rsquo;ll pardon my obsession, also sent $250 checks to retirees and disabled veterans, increased Pell Grants for low-income students by more than $600, and expanded unemployment benefits by $25 a week. Oh, and the stimulus&mdash;along with the much-maligned Wall Street bailouts and the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s aggressive monetary policies&mdash;helped prevent a depression, a very good thing for the poor and middle class as well as the wealthy and the Dow. The 10 million new jobs created in this recovery didn&rsquo;t all go to rich people.<\/p>\n<p>The stimulus also financed energy-efficiency retrofits of more than 1 million low-income homes, which will save families money and power for decades to come. And beyond the stimulus, the Department of Energy estimates that the Obama administration&rsquo;s new energy-efficiency mandates for refrigerators, air conditioners and dozens of other appliances will save consumers $450 billion on their electric bills through 2030. The administration&rsquo;s strict fuel-efficiency standards for cars and light trucks are expected save drivers another $500 billion. That&rsquo;s real money.<\/p>\n<p>Even the federal response to the foreclosure crisis, widely perceived as an abysmal failure, has provided financial help to millions of Americans in need. The most important move, widely perceived as a gift to undeserving corporations, was the $400 billion government bailout of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which kept mortgage credit flowing at a time when no one else would provide it, averted a dramatic increase in mortgage rates, and helped 26 million homeowners reduce their monthly payments by refinancing their mortgages by 2014. Federal programs like HARP (which helped 3 million of those homeowners refinance) and HAMP (which helped modify another 1.3 million loans) were slow and often inefficient, but low mortgage rates&mdash;maintained by the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s aggressive purchases of mortgage-backed securities as well as the government backstop for Fannie and Freddie&mdash;meant money in the bank for anyone with an adjustable-rate mortgage.<\/p>\n<p>Reasonable people can disagree about whether government should be in the business of redistribution&mdash;what Obama called &ldquo;spreading the wealth&rdquo; in his 2008 chat with Joe the Plumber&mdash;but we should recognize that it is. The inequality trends, as severe as they are, would be far more severe without government intervention. Yes, the average CEO earns almost as much in a day as the average worker earns in a year, but government&mdash;through progressive taxation, the safety net, public education and other public services, and the policies of the last five years&mdash;has been pushing back.<\/p>\n<p>Is it pushing back hard enough? Well, reasonable people can disagree about that, too.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3433301\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/politics\/","description":"Political insight from the Beltway and beyond.

Glasgow University researchers fed the loaded chocolate bar to 24 volunteers, and registered that within just 90 minutes, blood flow to the brain was &#8220;modestly&#8221; reduced in men, raising their risk of stroke.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Deep-fried Mars bar ingestion may acutely contribute to cerebral hypoperfusion in men,&#8221; the study concluded, noting that the same effects were not found among women.<\/p>\n<p>It sounds bad but it&#8217;s not exactly an unredeemable, one-way ticket to stroke city. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve shown that eating a sugar and fat-laden snack can actually affect blood flow to the brain within minutes,&#8221; said William Dunn, who performed scans on volunteers. &#8220;This reduction in the reactivity of blood vessels in the brain has previously been linked to an increased stroke risk &ndash; but the changes we observed were modest.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The infamous Scottish snack was invented at the Carron Fish Bar in Stonehaven, Aberdeenshire, in 1992 and is especially popular among tourists.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3442423\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"Newsfeed","slug":"newsfeed","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/newsfeed\/","description":"What's vital and viral from around the web, covering web culture, celebrities, food, internet trends, animals, technology, humor, fashion, sex and more"},"tag":{"name":"Food &amp; Drink","slug":"food-drink","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tag\/food-drink\/"},"tags":"Food &amp; Drink","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"http:\/\/i2.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/ap986194654649.jpg?crop=48px%2C3px%2C1655px%2C1655px&resize=100%2C100","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/ap986194654649.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/ap986194654649.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/ap986194654649.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/ap986194654649.jpg?w=1100"},"credit":"Danny Lawson\u2014PA Wire\/Press Association Images\/AP","caption":"Food in Scotland.

If you have a 10 o&#8217;clock meeting with President Clinton, it&rsquo;s really okay if you cruise in at 10:05, because he&rsquo;s not going to be ready until 10:20.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The differences in meeting styles go beyond punctuality, Summers continued: &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re meeting with President Obama, if it&rsquo;s a 30-minute meeting, at 10:26 his assistant will bring him an index card telling him about this next meeting, and at 10:30, you will be gone. That 30-minute meeting you were supposed to have with President Clinton that was supposed to begin at 10 and actually began at 10:20? At 10:50, he is just warming up.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Number 42 and Number 44 differ in their approach to meeting prep as well. If Summers gave Obama a memo in advance, he says, &ldquo;the probability that he would have read the memo was 99.5 percent, and if you attempted to summarize the memo, he would politely but very firmly say, &ldquo;Larry, I read the memo.&rdquo; President Clinton? &#8220;He might have read the memo. He might not have read the memo. He kind of welcomed your summary.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">While Obama focused on making decisions based on the information his advisers presented, Clinton wasn&rsquo;t afraid to give his advisers some food for thought. Doing an impression of sorts, Summers recalled the way he&rsquo;d go off on a tangent: &ldquo;Larry, you&rsquo;re talking about the unbanked, people without bank accounts. There was a guy, great guy, used to be mayor of Memphis, he had a program going to help the unbanked&mdash;beautiful wife&mdash;ran for Congress, I don&rsquo;t know what happened to him, great guy, you really should look into that program to use unemployed youth to install ATMs.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Though one was more disciplined and the other more freeform, he said both were effective leaders by staying true to their own styles.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Summers also came to Obama&rsquo;s defense in the forum when Meredith Whitney, the former stock analyst turned hedge fund manager who correctly predicted the subprime crisis in 2007, said that we&rsquo;re now in a period of over-regulation.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">If it&#8217;s really true that there&#8217;s a bureaucratic &#8220;war on corporations,&#8221; Summers asked, then &ldquo;why is it that the market value as measured by the stock market of American corporate business has grown more rapidly in the five and a half years of this presidential administration than any other administration since 1932? &#8230; why is it that corporate profits as a share of our economy are larger than they have ever been before?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just an odd kind of war in terms of the results.&rdquo;<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3442276\"><\/div><\/aside>","section":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/politics\/","description":"Political insight from the Beltway and beyond.
