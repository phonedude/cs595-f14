You can&#39;t say Israel want peace until they accept to talk to everybody, and release presure when they are…﻿</div></div></article></div><div class="YR"></div></div></div><div id="z13sgpdinkj2vtojl04chl3pvxfbszirt5o#1405334437389266" tabindex="-1" class="Ik Wv"jsmodel="mrYqlc"><div class="Wi lg "><a href="./102223843239854527510"class="ob Jk"oid="102223843239854527510"aria-hidden="true"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-xeQvbkAhIj4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABaQ/knPktzgiL7A/s28-c-k-no/photo.jpg" width="28px" height="28px" alt="" class="go wi Wh" oid="102223843239854527510"  /></a><div class="Jx"><article><div class="eR"><div class="fR"><a href="./102223843239854527510" class="ob tv Ub TD" rel="nofollow" rel="author" oid="102223843239854527510">Anass Sellak</a><div class="Nba Cw"></div><div class="wO"><span class="dE Jj"></span><span class="DI wp"><div class="Id"><div class="CI zh o-U-s-vg" tabindex="0" title="People who +1&#39;d this"><div dir="ltr" class="YC"><div class="Rp">+</div><div class="St Vk">2<br/>3<br/>2<br/></div></div></div> </div></span></div></div><div class="HA"><span role="button" class="d-s Kv dR" style="display:none;" tabindex="0">Reply</span></div></div><div class="Aq"><div class="tG QF">&nbsp;</div><div class="Ct">he looks intellectual until that topic ! <br>Sorry you should learn more about Palestine Mr <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink aaTEdf" href="/107033731246200681024" oid="107033731246200681024">Tim O&#39;Reilly</a></span> ﻿</div></div></article></div><div class="YR"></div></div></div><div id="z13sgpdinkj2vtojl04chl3pvxfbszirt5o#1405336827344983" tabindex="-1" class="Ik Wv"jsmodel="mrYqlc"><div class="Wi lg "><a href="./117689860965231377912"class="ob Jk"oid="117689860965231377912"aria-hidden="true"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-wMW63N9Dh-M/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAKU/E2gt3-AGaAo/s28-c-k-no/photo.jpg" width="28px" height="28px" alt="" class="go wi Wh" oid="117689860965231377912"  /></a><div class="Jx"><article><div class="eR"><div class="fR"><a href="./117689860965231377912" class="ob tv Ub TD" rel="nofollow" rel="author" oid="117689860965231377912">Anthony Morton</a><div class="Nba Cw"></div><div class="wO"><span class="dE Jj"></span><span class="DI wp"><div class="Id"><div class="CI zh o-U-s-vg" tabindex="0" title="People who +1&#39;d this"><div dir="ltr" class="YC"><div class="Rp">+</div><div class="St Vk">1<br/>2<br/>1<br/></div></div></div> </div></span></div></div><div class="HA"><span role="button" class="d-s Kv dR" style="display:none;" tabindex="0">Reply</span></div></div><div class="Aq"><div class="tG QF">&nbsp;</div><div class="Ct">Tim O&#39;Reilly is a troll.   ignore or block him﻿</div></div></article></div><div class="YR"></div></div></div><div id="z13sgpdinkj2vtojl04chl3pvxfbszirt5o#1405338118104350" tabindex="-1" class="Ik Wv"jsmodel="mrYqlc"><div class="Wi lg "><a href="./113447814326799865653"class="ob Jk"oid="113447814326799865653"aria-hidden="true"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-iW_PeZiPZZY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAJQ/Z5YWjJ6b21o/s28-c-k-no/photo.jpg" width="28px" height="28px" alt="" class="go wi Wh" oid="113447814326799865653"  /></a><div class="Jx"><article><div class="eR"><div class="fR"><a href="./113447814326799865653" class="ob tv Ub TD" rel="nofollow" rel="author" oid="113447814326799865653">Mandip Dosanjh</a><div class="Nba Cw"></div><div class="wO"><span class="dE Jj"></span><span class="DI wp"><div class="Id"><div class="CI zh o-U-s-vg" tabindex="0" title="People who +1&#39;d this"><div dir="ltr" class="YC"><div class="Rp">+</div><div class="St Vk">4<br/>5<br/>4<br/></div></div></div> </div></span></div></div><div class="HA"><span role="button" class="d-s Kv dR" style="display:none;" tabindex="0">Reply</span></div></div><div class="Aq"><div class="tG QF">&nbsp;</div><div class="Ct">I can&#39;t imagine the daily struggle of innocent Palestinian people or the threat of bombardment (for the Palestinians and Israelis alike), which could happen any minute of the day instigated by their leaders...from the safety of my house, thousands of miles away from the conflict.<br><br>But I do have some questions and thoughts about the conflict...so let&#39;s get started (please feel free to correct me if i&#39;m wrong).<br><br>The land where the State of Israel was founded upon was taken from the Palestinian territories (which at the time was controlled by the British)..and handed to them by the United Nations. This was a sort of compensation for the atrocities the Jewish people had to endure during the Holocaust/WWII.<br><br>Do note: that there was no Palestine (sovereign state) at the time, still was it wrong to do that? I think so...but anyways...it happened...now keep in mind that the Jewish people came out of the holocaust scarred, and finally had a place to call home...with a mindset &quot;never again&quot;..never again will we allow atrocities being committed against the Jews.<br><br>The neighboring Arab countries attacked the newly formed Israel and in the end lost the war and some of their territories...was it right to keep the won territories Ala Golan heights? I think it&#39;s logical that they did so, because the loss of life was on both sides, they didn&#39;t want any more loss of lives due to same height advantage in any new wars in the future.<br><br>I know what I&#39;ve written so far above^^ may be &quot;widely&quot; known fact...but we&#39;ve to consider this to see current situation in my opinion.<br><br>After all of that Palestinian Intifada/Resistance movement began...the first one was unarmed and the second one was not..while all of this took place, the world had changed with the Information age and technological revolution taking place.<br><br>If a sovereign Palestine state is what Palestinians desire, won&#39;t it be reached faster through <b>non-violence</b>?<br><br>After all in this age and time, Israel can&#39;t attack a non-armed Palestinian faction, the International community won&#39;t stand for it..therefore I wholeheartedly believe that a non-violence movement (like the first Intifada), would&#39;ve been successful in this day and age.<br><br>You may say, look at what is happening now...I think that this is the fault of Hamas themselves..let&#39;s ponder on this a bit.<br><br>Gaza is a densely populated area, when Hamas sends rockets attacking Israel from Gaza...and Israel retaliates by attacking known Hamas strongholds, it is not far fetched that innocent lives could be lost..is it fair? NO, but that&#39;s logical.<br><br>Like the article suggests, <i>&quot;Hamas is trying to get Israel to kill as many Palestinians as possible&quot;</i>..perverse and shocking but sadly true.<br><br>According to BBC around 1000 missiles have been fired into Israel in this conflict which is going into its 7th day...any ideas how much money those thing costs?<br><br>Wouldn&#39;t it have been better to have spent the money on things to alleviate some of the problems of the Palestinian people? Healthcare, Housing, Electricity, Water, Education, etc...? Instead of building/buying or smuggling rockets? And the millions of dollars they receive as aid?<br><br>If there was no smuggling of weapons, International pressure would have caused Israel to remove the blockade.<br><br>The conflict will not resolve because Hamas doesn&#39;t recognize Israel as a sovereign state and actively attacks the country...this also gives Israel the reason to retaliate...if the movement was non-violent, then any aggressive Israeli action would not be tolerated (this includes, the illegal Israeli settlements etc..).<br><br>You have tried by being aggressive, firing rockets...give non-violence a try. Palestinians should realize that by firing rockets into Israel, they are actually ensuring that the International community can&#39;t pressure Israel in full.<br><br>Israel should halt it&#39;s retaliation and Hamas should stop firing rockets into Israel...(one of them has to stop to give peace a chance) only solution to this situation will be found by coming together...not by releasing any propaganda videos.<br><br>I&#39;m open to any constructive and civilized discussion. ﻿</div></div></article></div><div class="YR"></div></div></div><div id="z13sgpdinkj2vtojl04chl3pvxfbszirt5o#1405338323468270" tabindex="-1" class="Ik Wv"jsmodel="mrYqlc"><div class="Wi lg "><a href="./101151078020673275690"class="ob Jk"oid="101151078020673275690"aria-hidden="true"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-uVwX1ltgxiU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAHsE/udQf20UwATs/s28-c-k-no/photo.jpg" width="28px" height="28px" alt="" class="go wi Wh" oid="101151078020673275690"  /></a><div class="Jx"><article><div class="eR"><div class="fR"><a href="./101151078020673275690" class="ob tv Ub TD" rel="nofollow" rel="author" oid="101151078020673275690">Simon Stuart</a><div class="Nba Cw"></div><div class="wO"><span class="dE Jj"></span><span class="DI wp"><div class="Id"><div class="CI zh o-U-s-vg" tabindex="0" title="People who +1&#39;d this"><div dir="ltr" class="YC"><div class="Rp">+</div><div class="St Vk">2<br/>3<br/>2<br/></div></div></div> </div></span></div></div><div class="HA"><span role="button" class="d-s Kv dR" style="display:none;" tabindex="0">Reply</span></div></div><div class="Aq"><div class="tG QF">&nbsp;</div><div class="Ct">Israel has absolutely no credibility what-so-ever.<br><br>We&#39;re talking about a country here who destroyed a US naval vessel, then tried to pin the blame on the Egyptians (the USS Liberty).<br><br>3 Israeli Mossad agents were arrested in New York on 9/11 with a truck <i>packed with cordite and thermate explosives</i> (enough to bring down a skyscraper).

nothing. There is a word for people who repeat the same failed practice over and over. Palestine simply don&#39;t have the fire- and man power to achieve its objectives. Israel does.<br>Firing rocket does only one thing. Alienates all potential allies.<br>Of course Israel wont talk with Hamas. Their admitted political agenda is to destroy Israel. <br><br>There is a winning strategy to follow for the Palestinians. Melt down weapons. Punish violence regardless whoever the victim is. If necessary ask UN for help (including to create a effective and impartial police force that works for the benefit of all people) This would very probably end the embargo and blockade. Invite foreign businessmen, tourists, musicians, journalist etc. Work on public relations, get sympathizers in democratic countries. Make sure you have cameras on site everywhere.

When they kidnap and murder kids, they know that the Israelis will have no choice but to react. When Israelis don&#39;t react fast or hard enough, they start shooting rockets from densely populated areas, knowing full well that there will be retaliation and that civilians will be hit in the process. When the bombs start falling, Hamas floods the media and social media with atrocious pictures of martyred children and women - not much talk of fighters getting hit, because they shoot their rockets and move quickly away from the neighbourhood. Netanyahu should be smart enough not to fall for this kind of tricks, but he isn&#39;t. Still, it&#39;s a trick played by Hamas with the lives of Palestinian people, just to score propaganda points. I wonder who is the real enemy of the Palestinian people? So far Hamas has managed to attract sympathy, but also death and destruction for its people. Perhaps a more constructive policy would be a better solution, but that&#39;s not what their foreign sponsors want: they want blood, martyrs and victims, not a durable solution.﻿</div></div></article></div><div class="YR"></div></div></div><div id="z13sgpdinkj2vtojl04chl3pvxfbszirt5o#1405345721970544" tabindex="-1" class="Ik Wv"jsmodel="mrYqlc"><div class="Wi lg "><a href="./101342751321418456978"class="ob Jk"oid="101342751321418456978"aria-hidden="true"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-FHQRuSLwm6A/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAABfow/T7hXJtcOZj0/s28-c-k-no/photo.jpg" width="28px" height="28px" alt="" class="go wi Wh" oid="101342751321418456978"  /></a><div class="Jx"><article><div class="eR"><div class="fR"><a href="./101342751321418456978" class="ob tv Ub TD" rel="nofollow" rel="author" oid="101342751321418456978">Piotr Azia</a><div class="Nba Cw"></div><div class="wO"><span class="dE Jj"></span><span class="DI wp"><div class="Id"><div class="CI zh o-U-s-vg" style="visibility:hidden" tabindex="0" title="People who +1&#39;d this"><div dir="ltr" class="YC"><div class="Rp">+</div><div class="St Vk">0<br/>1<br/>0<br/></div></div></div> </div></span></div></div><div class="HA"><span role="button" class="d-s Kv dR" style="display:none;" tabindex="0">Reply</span></div></div><div class="Aq"><div class="tG QF">&nbsp;</div><div class="Ct"><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink aaTEdf" href="/104941725376986787393" oid="104941725376986787393">Shahidul Alam</a></span> Why is it always a conspiracy, somebody else&#39;s fault? How about people making the wrong decisions, time and time again? How about people not seeing where is their interest, but going for the emotional solution? If people would stop blaming everybody else and looking after their own interests, perhaps they would find a good solution. Most countries have or have had enemies in their history. The ones that survived and prosper today, learned to make the right decisions and look after their own interests, instead of falling for every manipulation and propaganda.﻿</div></div></article></div><div class="YR"></div></div></div><div id="z13sgpdinkj2vtojl04chl3pvxfbszirt5o#1405345730905458" tabindex="-1" class="Ik Wv"jsmodel="mrYqlc"><div class="Wi lg "><a href="./105031417176197436269"class="ob Jk"oid="105031417176197436269"aria-hidden="true"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-K4yTx1pfAvc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAEZo/BatK66QOkbw/s28-c-k-no/photo.jpg" width="28px" height="28px" alt="" class="go wi Wh" oid="105031417176197436269"  /></a><div class="Jx"><article><div class="eR"><div class="fR"><a href="./105031417176197436269" class="ob tv Ub TD" rel="nofollow" rel="author" oid="105031417176197436269">Adam Koncz</a><div class="Nba Cw"></div><div class="wO"><span class="dE Jj"></span><span class="DI wp"><div class="Id"><div class="CI zh o-U-s-vg" tabindex="0" title="People who +1&#39;d this"><div dir="ltr" class="YC"><div class="Rp">+</div><div class="St Vk">2<br/>3<br/>2<br/></div></div></div> </div></span></div></div><div class="HA"><span role="button" class="d-s Kv dR" style="display:none;" tabindex="0">Reply</span></div></div><div class="Aq"><div class="tG QF">&nbsp;</div><div class="Ct"><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink aaTEdf" href="/104941725376986787393" oid="104941725376986787393">Shahidul Alam</a></span> &quot;Palestinian are protecting themselves from your bombs&quot;<br>How is the protection going?

Instead, with few exceptions, people got busy rebuilding their life, getting back to normality as far as possible. To the extent that mortal enemies made durable peace only a few years later. Some countries lost a high percentage of their population and vast territories - but they still decided to move on, come to terms and work hard to improve their life. Why is that totally impossible in the Middle East? Why is hatred more important than self-interest, self-preservation, than family and friends?﻿</div></div></article></div><div class="YR"></div></div></div><div id="z13sgpdinkj2vtojl04chl3pvxfbszirt5o#1405348196676748" tabindex="-1" class="Ik Wv"jsmodel="mrYqlc"><div class="Wi lg "><a href="./115440213129297896810"class="ob Jk"oid="115440213129297896810"aria-hidden="true"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-2kMdvpLD__A/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAHNM/Vr6gyl9iqHA/s28-c-k-no/photo.jpg" width="28px" height="28px" alt="" class="go wi Wh" oid="115440213129297896810"  /></a><div class="Jx"><article><div class="eR"><div class="fR"><a href="./115440213129297896810" class="ob tv Ub TD" rel="nofollow" rel="author" oid="115440213129297896810">Allen Edwards</a><div class="Nba Cw"></div><div class="wO"><span class="dE Jj"></span><span class="DI wp"><div class="Id"><div class="CI zh o-U-s-vg" tabindex="0" title="People who +1&#39;d this"><div dir="ltr" class="YC"><div class="Rp">+</div><div class="St Vk">1<br/>2<br/>1<br/></div></div></div> </div></span></div></div><div class="HA"><span role="button" class="d-s Kv dR" style="display:none;" tabindex="0">Reply</span></div></div><div class="Aq"><div class="tG QF">&nbsp;</div><div class="Ct">JimCroce:<br><br>You don&#39;t tug on Superman&#39;s cape<br>You don&#39;t spit into the wind<br>You don&#39;t pull the mask off that old Lone Ranger<br>And you don&#39;t mess around with Jim<br><br>I might add:<br>And you don&#39;t fire little rockets at a stronger neighbor.  Nothing good can come from it.﻿</div></div></article></div><div class="YR"></div></div></div><div id="z13sgpdinkj2vtojl04chl3pvxfbszirt5o#1405353274067202" tabindex="-1" class="Ik Wv"jsmodel="mrYqlc"><div class="Wi lg "><a href="./115223078121032458906"class="ob Jk"oid="115223078121032458906"aria-hidden="true"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-28AKK0HdHCY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAXDQ/wpGRsG7qVvE/s28-c-k-no/photo.jpg" width="28px" height="28px" alt="" class="go wi Wh" oid="115223078121032458906"  /></a><div class="Jx"><article><div class="eR"><div class="fR"><a href="./115223078121032458906" class="ob tv Ub TD" rel="nofollow" rel="author" oid="115223078121032458906">Porter Woodward</a><div class="Nba Cw"></div><div class="wO"><span class="dE Jj"></span><span class="DI wp"><div class="Id"><div class="CI zh o-U-s-vg" tabindex="0" title="People who +1&#39;d this"><div dir="ltr" class="YC"><div class="Rp">+</div><div class="St Vk">2<br/>3<br/>2<br/></div></div></div> </div></span></div></div><div class="HA"><span role="button" class="d-s Kv dR" style="display:none;" tabindex="0">Reply</span></div></div><div class="Aq"><div class="tG QF">&nbsp;</div><div class="Ct">The interview I heard with one of the heads of the Kurdish state in Iraq on NPR recently was wonderful.  The word above <i>mature</i> is the correct one.  Really gave me hope for peaceful resolutions to these sorts of problems.﻿</div></div></article></div><div class="YR"></div></div></div><div id="z13sgpdinkj2vtojl04chl3pvxfbszirt5o#1405353941866821" tabindex="-1" class="Ik Wv"jsmodel="mrYqlc"><div class="Wi lg "><a href="./118372027392551945228"class="ob Jk"oid="118372027392551945228"aria-hidden="true"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-W_myOAvcPEY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABhg/t9JFMYu3FK4/s28-c-k-no/photo.jpg" width="28px" height="28px" alt="" class="go wi Wh" oid="118372027392551945228"  /></a><div class="Jx"><article><div class="eR"><div class="fR"><a href="./118372027392551945228" class="ob tv Ub TD" rel="nofollow" rel="author" oid="118372027392551945228">Kayza Kleinman</a><div class="Nba Cw"></div><div class="wO"><span class="dE Jj"></span><span class="DI wp"><div class="Id"><div class="CI zh o-U-s-vg" style="visibility:hidden" tabindex="0" title="People who +1&#39;d this"><div dir="ltr" class="YC"><div class="Rp">+</div><div class="St Vk">0<br/>1<br/>0<br/></div></div></div> </div></span></div></div><div class="HA"><span role="button" class="d-s Kv dR" style="display:none;" tabindex="0">Reply</span></div></div><div class="Aq"><div class="tG QF">&nbsp;</div><div class="Ct">It&#39;s really sad, isn&#39;t it.

your comparison accurate, if we were shooting unarmed Iranian protesters, stealing their land, which is why they were launching the rockets,  then we really wouldn&#39;t have any moral high ground to be angry at them. <br><br>How many Israelis civilians have been killed by their rockets this latest round of conflict?  How many Palestinians civilians have been killed by the Israeli reaction?  <br><br>How about the last 10 years?  20 years?<br><br>The numbers are so skewed in Israels favor.  <br><br>Ok so 3 Israelis teens were murdered, not long before that 2 Palestinian teens were killed also.  Both unarmed, not participating any any violence shot by the IDF.  All caught on security film.  <br><br>Does that justify the killing of the 3 Israelis?  No.   But then by that same reason it doesn&#39;t justify any Israeli reprisals either. <br><br>Which is it, reprisals are valid or aren&#39;t they? If they are they are for BOTH sides.  If they aren&#39;t, they aren&#39;t for BOTH sides. <br><br>And how does any of that change the fact that the Kurds led MANY armed attacks on Iraq and had the protection of the No Fly zone for many years.  So the articles comparison is completely dishonest and ridiculous. <br><br><i>&quot;How is the protection going? Does it work?&quot;</i><br><br>How has bombing the Palestinians gone for you the past 60 years?  Has it gotten you peace? <br><br>How about those settlements?  Are they working to ensure peace also? <br><br><br>BTW casualty number for just airstrikes this last week, Israel has killed 169 Palestinians.<br><br>Israel&#39;s national emergency medical service, said Wednesday that 123 people had been treated – 80 percent of them for shock or anxiety.  ZERO deaths. <br><br>In the 2008-2009 Gaza War, the pattern was also evident. According to numbers released by the Israeli Defense Force, 1,166 Palestinians died.   13 Israelis.  Only 3 of the 13 were civilian. <br><br>As you said, Palestinian actions haven&#39;t helped their cause, but then neither has Israels. ﻿</div></div></article></div><div class="YR"></div></div></div><div id="z13sgpdinkj2vtojl04chl3pvxfbszirt5o#1405371220471858" tabindex="-1" class="Ik

You have to start by making the right development decisions, not just spend 65 years blaming everybody instead of getting your finger out and doing something for yourself. Palestinian territories receive billions of dollars from the Arab countries, the EU and the UN, to mention the main ones. Surely enough to build schools, hospitals and homes for people, if corruption and weapons were not the first and only priorities.﻿</div></div></article></div><div class="YR"></div></div></div><div id="z13sgpdinkj2vtojl04chl3pvxfbszirt5o#1405424231683208" tabindex="-1" class="Ik Wv"jsmodel="mrYqlc"><div class="Wi lg "><a href="./115734708343869390180"class="ob Jk"oid="115734708343869390180"aria-hidden="true"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-7U96HX5rJ-M/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABTc/8-M3-VYpheg/s28-c-k-no/photo.jpg" width="28px" height="28px" alt="" class="go wi Wh" oid="115734708343869390180"  /></a><div class="Jx"><article><div class="eR"><div class="fR"><a href="./115734708343869390180" class="ob tv Ub TD" rel="nofollow" rel="author" oid="115734708343869390180">Mitch Stokely</a><div class="Nba Cw"></div><div class="wO"><span class="dE Jj"></span><span class="DI wp"><div class="Id"><div class="CI zh o-U-s-vg" style="visibility:hidden" tabindex="0" title="People who +1&#39;d this"><div dir="ltr" class="YC"><div class="Rp">+</div><div class="St Vk">0<br/>1<br/>0<br/></div></div></div> </div></span></div></div><div class="HA"><span role="button" class="d-s Kv dR" style="display:none;" tabindex="0">Reply</span></div></div><div class="Aq"><div class="tG QF">&nbsp;</div><div class="Ct">Think of the volume of news articles and energy wasted on this conflict the last 50 years.

You will find complete idiots on either side. The point is not to allow them to torpedo every single attempt at finding a solution. Every time there were Israeli-Palestinian talks and a solution seemed within reach, somebody would walk into an Israeli bus or a restaurant and blow themselves up, killing a lot of people in the process. Now it&#39;s kidnaps and rockets. Some people just don&#39;t want peace, because it would undercut their idea of keeping the situation nice and festering. They&#39;ve managed during the last 65 years, so why should they stop now? It takes courageous and intelligent people on BOTH sides, determined to make peace and stop this senseless tit-for-tat. Throwing accusations back and forth and scoring propaganda points will not improve the situation - people just have to sit around a table and ignore the assassins and the crazies and get on with finding a solution.﻿</div></div></article></div><div class="YR"></div></div></div><div id="z13sgpdinkj2vtojl04chl3pvxfbszirt5o#1405427927046665" tabindex="-1" class="Ik Wv"jsmodel="mrYqlc"><div class="Wi lg "><a href="./107140639929094144668"class="ob Jk"oid="107140639929094144668"aria-hidden="true"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-1uzxvF_EM8c/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAADz8/87Bgfvx2rZs/s28-c-k-no/photo.jpg" width="28px" height="28px" alt="" class="go wi Wh" oid="107140639929094144668"  /></a><div class="Jx"><article><div class="eR"><div class="fR"><a href="./107140639929094144668" class="ob tv Ub TD" rel="nofollow" rel="author" oid="107140639929094144668">Olivier de Broqueville</a><div class="Nba Cw"></div><div class="wO"><span class="dE Jj"></span><span class="DI wp"><div class="Id"><div class="CI zh o-U-s-vg" tabindex="0" title="People who +1&#39;d this"><div dir="ltr" class="YC"><div class="Rp">+</div><div class="St Vk">1<br/>2<br/>1<br/></div></div></div> </div></span></div></div><div class="HA"><span role="button" class="d-s Kv dR" style="display:none;" tabindex="0">Reply</span></div></div><div class="Aq"><div class="tG QF">&nbsp;</div><div class="Ct"><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink aaTEdf" href="/101342751321418456978" oid="101342751321418456978">Piotr Azia</a></span> and <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink aaTEdf" href="/113447814326799865653" oid="113447814326799865653">Mandip Dosanjh</a></span> Agree with you: if the moderates are a majority on both sides, then they should speak up and rail in those proning violence and hatred.  Only if there is a strong committment to Peace on both sides, can a peaceful two state solution be achieved.﻿</div></div></article></div><div class="YR"></div></div></div><div id="z13sgpdinkj2vtojl04chl3pvxfbszirt5o#1405428518271649" tabindex="-1" class="Ik Wv"jsmodel="mrYqlc"><div class="Wi lg "><a href="./104941725376986787393"class="ob Jk"oid="104941725376986787393"aria-hidden="true"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-_Fi5GeRTsPQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAATo/jRIAPWa4U_k/s28-c-k-no/photo.jpg" width="28px" height="28px" alt="" class="go wi Wh" oid="104941725376986787393"  /></a><div class="Jx"><article><div class="eR"><div class="fR"><a href="./104941725376986787393" class="ob tv Ub TD" rel="nofollow" rel="author" oid="104941725376986787393">Shahidul Alam</a><div class="Nba Cw"></div><div class="wO"><span class="dE Jj"></span><span class="DI wp"><div class="Id"><div class="CI zh o-U-s-vg" tabindex="0" title="People who +1&#39;d this"><div dir="ltr" class="YC"><div class="Rp">+</div><div class="St Vk">1<br/>2<br/>1<br/></div></div></div> </div></span></div></div><div class="HA"><span role="button" class="d-s Kv dR" style="display:none;" tabindex="0">Reply</span></div></div><div class="Aq"><div class="tG QF">&nbsp;</div><div class="Ct"><span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink aaTEdf" href="/101342751321418456978" oid="101342751321418456978">Piotr Azia</a></span> I do agree that there are twats on both sides.

Contrary to what&#39;s been reported in the news for years, there is no Israeli-Palestinian conflict. None, zero, zilch, diddly-squat. I can say with confidence that Palestinians have no agency. The Israeli government controls everything in the country. This total control which is most magnified in the West Bank, concerns everything from where Palestinians are permitted to travel, to how much water they consume per month. Currently, there is no &#39;conflict,&#39; only the omnipresent power of the Israeli government and those who resist it. This is important to understand.&quot;&quot;</i><br><br><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ferrari-sheppard/i-traveled-to-palestine_b_4761896.html" class="ot-anchor aaTEdf">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ferrari-sheppard/i-traveled-to-palestine_b_4761896.html</a>﻿</div></div></article></div><div class="YR"></div></div></div><div id="z13sgpdinkj2vtojl04chl3pvxfbszirt5o#1406418521030858" tabindex="-1" class="Ik Wv"jsmodel="mrYqlc"><div class="Wi lg "><a href="./108447039773039786532"class="ob Jk"oid="108447039773039786532"aria-hidden="true"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-iPCu6qKfH58/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAPsk/8L-YXBqf_aI/s28-c-k-no/photo.jpg" width="28px" height="28px" alt="" class="go wi Wh" oid="108447039773039786532"  /></a><div class="Jx"><article><div class="eR"><div class="fR"><a href="./108447039773039786532" class="ob tv Ub TD" rel="nofollow" rel="author" oid="108447039773039786532">Kent Goertzen</a><div class="Nba Cw"></div><div class="wO"><span class="dE Jj"></span><span class="DI wp"><div class="Id"><div class="CI zh o-U-s-vg" style="visibility:hidden" tabindex="0" title="People who +1&#39;d this"><div dir="ltr" class="YC"><div class="Rp">+</div><div class="St Vk">0<br/>1<br/>0<br/></div></div></div> </div></span></div></div><div class="HA"><span role="button" class="d-s Kv dR" style="display:none;" tabindex="0">Reply</span></div></div><div class="Aq"><div class="tG QF">&nbsp;</div><div class="Ct">Even Israelis are turning against this atrocity being committed by their country. <br><br>&quot;We are killing children, we are killing civilians, because we were told that God gave us this land, and half of us don&#39;t even believe...&quot;﻿<br><br><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.salon.com/2014/07/26/israel_is_not_my_birthright/?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=socialflow" class="ot-anchor aaTEdf">http://www.salon.com/2014/07/26/israel_is_not_my_birthright/?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=socialflow</a>﻿</div></div></article></div><div class="YR"></div></div></div><div id="z13sgpdinkj2vtojl04chl3pvxfbszirt5o#1406418548903402" tabindex="-1" class="Ik Wv"jsmodel="mrYqlc"><div class="Wi lg "><a href="./115440213129297896810"class="ob Jk"oid="115440213129297896810"aria-hidden="true"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-2kMdvpLD__A/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAHNM/Vr6gyl9iqHA/s28-c-k-no/photo.jpg" width="28px" height="28px" alt="" class="go wi Wh" oid="115440213129297896810"  /></a><div class="Jx"><article><div class="eR"><div class="fR"><a href="./115440213129297896810" class="ob tv Ub TD" rel="nofollow" rel="author" oid="115440213129297896810">Allen Edwards</a><div class="Nba Cw"></div><div class="wO"><span class="dE Jj"></span><span class="DI wp"><div class="Id"><div class="CI zh o-U-s-vg" style="visibility:hidden" tabindex="0" title="People who +1&#39;d this"><div dir="ltr" class="YC"><div class="Rp">+</div><div class="St Vk">0<br/>1<br/>0<br/></div></div></div> </div></span></div></div><div class="HA"><span role="button" class="d-s Kv dR" style="display:none;" tabindex="0">Reply</span></div></div><div class="Aq"><div class="tG QF">&nbsp;</div><div class="Ct">Didn&#39;t I just read that Hamas declined a cease fire?

It is very hard for any people to build infrastructure and establish institutions when its oppressor is bent on killing its leaders and destroying its homes, schools and hospitals.

restraint compared to what my country would do.  We bombed Iraq much more than Israel is bombing Gaza and we killed 100,000 innocent people.  Iraq didn&#39;t even do anything to us to provoke an attack.  If Gaza was firing rockets at the US, the country would be leveled. <br><br>In WW II we leveled two Japanese cities killing about 200,000 innocent people.  I don&#39;t think that was a good thing to do but I would not call it stupid.  The Japanese were not stupid to surrender and Hamas would not be stupid to do the same. ﻿</div></div></article></div><div class="YR"></div></div></div><div

damaging a rehabilitation center for the Handicapped, damaging a UN school.  And the UN has even said there were no Hamas rockets near that school. <br><br>Don&#39;t even bother replying, you are to

Netanyahu should be smart enough not to fall for this kind of tricks, but he isn't. Still, it's a trick played by Hamas with the lives of Palestinian people, just to score propaganda points. I wonder who is the real enemy of the Palestinian people? So far Hamas has managed to attract sympathy, but also death and destruction for its people. Perhaps a more constructive policy would be a better solution, but that's not what their foreign sponsors want: they want blood, martyrs and victims, not a durable solution.\ufeff"]

,[0," guess what? You will find complete idiots on either side. The point is not to allow them to torpedo every single attempt at finding a solution. Every time there were Israeli-Palestinian talks and a solution seemed within reach, somebody would walk into an Israeli bus or a restaurant and blow themselves up, killing a lot of people in the process. Now it's kidnaps and rockets. Some people just don't want peace, because it would undercut their idea of keeping the situation nice and festering. They've managed during the last 65 years, so why should they stop now? It takes courageous and intelligent people on BOTH sides, determined to make peace and stop this senseless tit-for-tat. Throwing accusations back and forth and scoring propaganda points will not improve the situation - people just have to sit around a table and ignore the assassins and the crazies and get on with finding a solution.\ufeff"]
