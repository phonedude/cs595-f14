On September 11, 2012, 1.5 million people demonstrated behind a placard that read “Catalonia: Next State in Europe” despite pleas from the not-yet-independentist Catalan government to limit demands to a new fiscal pact. After the march, the Catalan President went to Madrid anyway to demand the fiscal pact, but the Spanish Prime Minister made it clear that there would be none. President Mas gave a memorable speech in Madrid and the following Monday called snap elections for the Catalan Parliament: since a fiscal pact was impossible, and his party had not run with an pro independence platform, he decided it was necessary to consult the people before proceeding. Pro independence parties won almost two thirds of the seats. The President’s coalition CiU and the pro-independence ERC signed a pact of governability with the proviso that a referendum would be held during 2014.","markups":[{"type":3,"start":92,"end":119,"href":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/11/catalan-independence-rally-barcelona","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0},{"type":3,"start":465,"end":491,"href":"http://www.newscatalonia.com/2012/09/full-transcript-of-catalan-president.html","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0},{"type":3,"start":758,"end":792,"href":"http://www.newscatalonia.com/2012/11/who-won-in-catalonia.html","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0},{"type":3,"start":908,"end":943,"href":"http://www.newscatalonia.com/2012/12/ciu-and-erc-come-to-agreement.html","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0}]},{"name":"4f38","type":1,"text":"The Catalan Parliament declared its sovereignty in January of 2013.
