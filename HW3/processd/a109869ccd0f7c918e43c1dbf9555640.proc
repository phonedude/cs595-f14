An Astronaut's View of the North Korean Electricity Black Hole

   Power cuts make the dictatorship virtually disappear at night.

   North Korea may be a horribly repressive dictatorship by day. At night,
   it also does a good impression of being nothing – a barren wasteland,
   an expanse of ocean, a light-devouring black hole.

   That's if you look at it from space, as one of the astronauts aboard
   the International Space Station recently did. This photo from more than
   200 miles above the planet's surface shows just what a difference a
   robust electric grid can make on a country's appearance. To the north
   is China, blazing out of the darkness like a sea of fire. Below is
   South Korea, its borders defined as clearly as patterns on a
   Lite-Brite. And between these two is a big sandwich of darkness with
   Pyongyang, a city of more than 3 million people, emitting only the
   faintest smudge of fluorescence.

   North Korea's invisibility cloak is due to mandatory power cuts at
   night, part of the country's struggle to conserve its precious energy.
   Comparing its capital city to other nearby fixtures, NASA says it shows
   a light signature that's "equivalent to the smaller towns in South
   Korea." The space agency has a few more details to share about this
   singular image:

     Unlike daylight images, city lights at night illustrate dramatically
     the relative economic importance of cities, as gauged by relative
     size. In this north-looking view, it is immediately obvious that
     greater Seoul is a major city and that the port of Gunsan is minor
     by comparison. There are 25.6 million people in the Seoul
     metropolitan area – more than half of South Korea’s citizens – while
     Gunsan’s population is 280,000....

     Coastlines are often very apparent in night imagery, as shown by
     South Korea’s eastern shoreline. But the coast of North Korea is
     difficult to detect. These differences are illustrated in per capita
     power consumption in the two countries, with South Korea at 10,162
     kilowatt hours and North Korea at 739 kilowatt hours.

   North Korea has flickered like a candle among klieg lights since the
   early 90s, when the collapse of the Soviet Union limited its access to
   inexpensive, Communist-approved fuel. A subsequent energy deal with the
   Americans fell apart, leaving many North Koreans resentful to this
   day toward the United States. The once-developed nation now ranks 71st
   in power consumption; it's so dark at night people out for a stroll
   sometimes can't even see the buildings on either side of them.

   Here's an animated view of the space station's flyover of the Korean
   peninsula – there's a high-def though slow-loading version at the
   Gateway to Astronaut Photography of Earth:
