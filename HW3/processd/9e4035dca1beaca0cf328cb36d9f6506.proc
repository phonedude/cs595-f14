Malthus, Marx, and Modern Growth

   CAMBRIDGE – The promise that each generation will be better off than
   the last is a fundamental tenet of modern society. By and large, most
   advanced economies have fulfilled this promise, with living standards
   rising over recent generations, despite setbacks from wars and
   financial crises.

   In the developing world, too, the vast majority of people have started
   to experience sustained improvement in living standards and are rapidly
   developing similar growth expectations. But will future generations,
   particularly in advanced economies, realize such expectations? Though
   the likely answer is yes, the downside risks seem higher than they did
   a few decades ago.

   So far, every prediction in the modern era that mankind’s lot will
   worsen, from Thomas Malthus to Karl Marx, has turned out to be
   spectacularly wrong. Technological progress has trumped obstacles to
   economic growth. Periodic political rebalancing, sometimes peaceful,
   sometimes not, has ensured that the vast majority of people have
   benefited, albeit some far more than others.

   As a result, Malthus’s concerns about mass starvation have failed to
   materialize in any peaceful capitalist economy. And, despite a
   disconcerting fall in labor’s share of income in recent decades, the
   long-run picture still defies Marx’s prediction that capitalism would
   prove immiserating for workers. Living standards around the world
   continue to rise.

   [rogoff114chart]

   But past growth performance is no guarantee that a broadly similar
   trajectory can be maintained throughout this century. Leaving aside
   potential geopolitical disruptions, there are some formidable
   challenges to overcome, mostly stemming from political underperformance
   and dysfunction.

   The first set of issues includes slow-burn problems involving
   externalities, the leading example being environmental degradation.
   When property rights are ill-defined, as in the case of air and water,
   government must step in to provide appropriate regulation. I do not
   envy future generations for having to address the possible
   ramifications of global warming and fresh-water depletion.

   A second set of problems concerns the need to ensure that the economic
   system is perceived as fundamentally fair, which is the key to its
   political sustainability. This perception can no longer be taken for
   granted, as the interaction of technology and globalization has
   exacerbated income and wealth inequality within countries, even as
   cross-country gaps have narrowed.

   Until now, our societies have proved remarkably adept at adjusting to
   disruptive technologies; but the pace of change in recent decades has
   caused tremendous strains, reflected in huge income disparities within
   countries, with near-record gaps between the wealthiest and the rest.
   Inequality can corrupt and paralyze a country’s political system – and
   economic growth along with it.

   The third problem is that of aging populations, an issue that would
   pose tough challenges even for the best-designed political system. How
   will resources be allocated to care for the elderly, especially in
   slow-growing economies where existing public pension schemes and
   old-age health plans are patently unsustainable? Soaring public debts
   surely exacerbate the problem, because future generations are being
   asked both to service our debt and to pay for our retirements.

   The final challenge concerns a wide array of issues that require
   regulation of rapidly evolving technologies by governments that do not
   necessarily have the competence or resources to do so effectively. We
   have already seen where poor regulation of rapidly evolving financial
   markets can lead. There are parallel shortcomings in many other
   markets.

   A leading example is food supply – an area where technology has
   continually produced ever-more highly processed and genetically refined
   food that scientists are only beginning to assess. What is known so far
   is that childhood obesity has become an epidemic in many countries,
   with an alarming rise in rates of type 2 diabetes and coronary disease
   implying a significant negative impact on life expectancy in future
   generations.

   Many leading health researchers, including Kelly Brownell, David
   Ludwig, and Walter Willett, have documented these problems. Government
   interventions to date, mainly in the form of enhanced education, have
   proved largely ineffective. Self-destructive addiction to processed
   foods, which economists would describe as an “internality,” can lower
   quality of life for those afflicted, and can eventually lead to
   externalities for society, such as higher health-care costs. Again,
   despite a rising chorus of concern from researchers, political markets
   have seemed frozen.

   All of these problems have solutions, at least in the short to medium
   run. A global carbon tax would mitigate climate risks while alleviating
   government debt burdens. Addressing inequality requires greater
   redistribution through national tax systems, together with enhanced
   programs for adult education, presumably making heavy use of new
   technologies. The negative effects of falling population growth can be
   mitigated by easing restrictions on international migration, and by
   encouraging more women and retirees to enter or stay in the workforce.
   But how long it will take for governments to act is a wide-open
   question.

   Capitalist economies have been spectacularly efficient at enabling
   growing consumption of private goods, at least over the long run. When
   it comes to public goods – such as education, the environment, health
   care, and equal opportunity – the record is not quite as impressive,
   and the political obstacles to improvement have seemed to grow as
   capitalist economies have matured.

   Will each future generation continue to enjoy a better quality of life
   than its immediate predecessor? In developing countries that have not
   yet reached the technological frontier, the answer is almost certainly
   yes. In advanced economies, though the answer should still be yes, the
   challenges are becoming formidable.

       There is an aporia in K. Rogoff's reasoning on a relation which I
       very often criticize, that of the effects of the population growth
       on the economic growth. Obviously, over-simplification often
       follows in considering that the demographic decline or stagnation
       is compensated by a rise in immigration. It is also evoked for
       sustaining retirement pensions. One remembers for example this
       delirious study of the UNO at the beginning of the years 2000,
       which recommended the surge of hundreds of million immigrants in
       Europe. This thesis has been however demolished with the awareness
       of the ageing of the immigrant populations and the rise in their
       incomes.
       But the relation between the two growths is itself antiquated. K.
       Rogoff precisely underlines the effects of technological progress
       on the rise of the living standard and on the overcoming of some
       limits of natural resources in particular, asserted in the 18th and
       19th centuries. Besides, there are still perspectives of exhaustion
       of certain resources (oil…), for which the substitutes are not yet
       discovered or at bearable cost.
       But K. Rogoff eludes that the rise in the standard of living is
       generally related to an inflection of the population growth, as
       China also testifies to it today. One also often eludes that the
       fall of unemployment in Germany was obtained thanks to the
       stagnation of the working population between 2005 and 2010.
       Moreover, the growth has been weak for several years in developed
       countries in spite of the population growth. In the large Arab
       countries, the economic growth is too weak compared to that of the
       population. A “minimal” indicator is in any case the GDP per capita
       before focusing on the standard of living.
       Another aporia quite as enormous is that unemployment has increased
       much in most Euro-Anglo-Saxon countries for a few decades, which
       entails less consumption, lower birthrate, but also corresponds
       to unemployed productive resources. In such a context, an addition
       of population has only sclerosing effects, weighing in particular
       on the social systems, especially as it is composed of immigrants,
       increasingly substitutable with natives.
       Not counting the negative impact on the sustainability of the
       economic growth.

       The period between the 1940s-1970s was dominated in the U.S. by
       business, labor and political oligopolies with little external
       competition. The economic success of Europe was based on its low
       starting point - economies and infrastructure destroyed by the war,
       combined with a "bourgeois" value system enabled it to recover by
       rebuilding its industry and infrastructure. In both cases the show
       was over by the late 1970s as then emerging markets like Japan,
       South Korea and Taiwan were able to produce steel and even final
       goods at more competitive prices. Europe retained its social
       democratic political structure, irrespective of which party happens
       to be in power and the results show: those coming into the labor
       force have scant opportunity while those that are established can
       look forward to lifetime employment and a healthy pension at a
       comparatively young age. However, this won't last either as
       demographics catch up to "old" Europe.

       With all due respect, I am afraid that Prof. Rogoff has interpreted
       Marx in a way the thinker itself would never approve. My critique
       has nothing to do with the accuracy of his "prophecies" but is
       related to the methodological and philosophical levels.
       It´s all about fetishism. If you would ask Marx, to measure the
       "benefits" of Capitalism in material terms alone is exactly the
       worst "sin" a social thinker can make. Why? Because it means to
       render the social activity of production and consumption to
       relation between human beings and OBJECTS, what he called
       fetishism.
       According to Marx (and even Smith, or Ricardo) Economy is a social
       activity and interchange is a social relation, not a material one.
       Therefore, Exploitation, or "improved living standards " is a
       RELATIVE term in social terms as all the economy is THE social
       activity. To put all the social structure only in material terms is
       like analysing the economy with the famous Robinson Crusoe case (so
       famous among Econ 101 students...) Therefore, the loss of
       purchasing power among the working people is the definitive
       reflection of the Capitalist system
       I would even say that the Prof. forgets the international
       perspective, so important in a globalized world. If the income gap
       is measured in international terms instead in national terms (as
       should be in a globalized economy) , the gap income is even more
       sever than in one country. Just compare the GDP per capita between
       lets say, Luxembourg and almost any Sub Sahara African country is
       just a reflection of the modern mechanism of exploitation

       Attention grabbing title and author, nothing new in terms of "meat"
       of the article, kinda dry recitation of existing issues, no
       prescription of action, no mention even that a lot of these
       economically advanced countries' issues are being trended by Japan.
       Such a lite article, almost propaganda-like. Weird feeling to read
       on the heels of Rogoff's famous data "mistake".

       What is a global carbon tax? Do you mean equal carbon taxes
       implemented at exactly the same time and enforced with exactly the
       same rigour in every country on earth? Tall order. Have you heard
       of the Kyoto accord? It didnt go very well.
       But I think growth will explode with technology. The technological
       horizon is expanding at a faster rate than many developing
       countries are able to approach it. Wealth is spreading around the
       world but through a trickle down effect. I think America and the
       west will only expand its lead as most of these technologies are
       industrial and military secrets. Americas innovation has no end. We
       have even slain the business cycle with financial innovation.

       This guy is delusional. How exactly do mainstream economists think
       that growth can continue forever when it is painfully clear (to
       those of us with functioning brains) that the planet we live on has
       limits? This is pure insanity.
       "the long-run picture still defies Marx’s prediction that
       capitalism would prove immiserating for workers"
       Is that a joke? Tell that to all the people who have had their pay
       and benefits slashed, year after year. Tell that to all the people
       who can't find work or who are working multiple part-time jobs
       because companies keep reducing full-time positions. Tell that to
       all the people who work in deplorable conditions overseas to make
       all the stuff we use. Just because you can't see them doesn't mean
       they don't exist. It's no wonder that mainstream economists can't
       solve our problems - they are completely out of touch with reality!

       Liberalism has a great deal to do with capitalism. First its
       principal task was to desroty old social shackles that hindered
       free economic activities. "In the sixteenth century this
       ideological revolution....it is a new theology; and in the building
       of this researches are undertaken which undermine the hold of the
       faith upon men's minds. Finally a new cosmology is built, the
       result of which are a new scientific outlook, on the one hand, and
       a new metaphysics on the other (Harold Laski, The Rise of European
       Liberalism.)
       There was, in Great Britain in the first half of the nineteenth
       century, a school of thought that said that all and the only thing
       that we should concern ourselves was to take care so that our
       economic activities would go on and expand as smoothly as possible
       and that everything else would automatically follow.
       We now are increasingly made conscious that something very
       important is missing in this economic, and therefore social,
       outlook. We increasingly come to suspect that our economic
       activities depend on other social institutions, that our economic
       activites are destroying them, that our exclusive cult of economy
       may not take us nowhere ultimately, and that it will not help us
       build a good society. If so, this chill on our unbounded optimism,
       traceable back to the eighteenth century enlightenment philosophy,
       is very welcome.

       I knew it had to be in here somewhere. And Prof. Rogoff does not
       disappoint! He is really stuck on this idea that the national debt
       is a problem. For countries whose debt is denominated in a currency
       that they issue, this is manifestly not so. And, Prof. Rogoff's
       attempts to prove otherwise have backfired spectacularly. Yet, here
       he is again, trotting out this old zombie, and in language that
       suggests it is not even controversial!
       This article contains another gem. "Adult education" will somehow
       combat economic inequality. When we are all professors like Dr.
       Rogoff, who is going to collect the garbage? And, who will be our
       students, to pay our salaries? If only workers could train-up for
       higher-paying jobs, then all would be well.
       I am certainly in favor of providing educational opportunities for
       everyone that wants them. However, a much more pressing economic
       issue is ensuring that workers in *every* job can live with
       dignity.

       In the emerging world, the change will still be rapid from
       Generation X to Y to Z, growth will happen with marginal product of
       labor and capital yielding significant changes to living standards;
       in my life I have seen my grandmother not going to school and my
       daughter under-graduating in the top U.S. University.
       The trouble with the developed world, as perhaps somewhat touched
       upon by Rogoff, is that the growth is extremely skewed towards
       those who have the wherewithal to bid for it and get the benefits.
       It is becoming a strange world where opportunities are getting
       deeply concentrated to a very few; such is still not the case in
       the emerging world.

       I have to laugh when I read this - the industrial age is OVER -
       because CHEAP oil is over - and we are debating if future
       generations will live better than us????
       Ha ha ha --- they will live in a world of starvation and disease.
       High energy prices = less consumption because everything including
       the fuel in your tank costs more = layoffs = less tax revenue =
       government cutbacks, layoffs and debt increases = less consumption
       = more layoffs = less taxes ===== economic death spiral.
       Compounding the problem is the fact that a weak labour market means
       real wages drop - as they are across the world right now - that
       means everything is more expensive and your buying power is
       dropping at the same time.
       Governments recognize this and are trying to offset with debt, easy
       lending (they are purposely inflating bubbles), lower interest
       rates and money printing.
       Of course they will fail - because the disease is expensive oil.
       And there is no substitute
       The economic death spiral will accelerate when the QE and ZIRP no
       longer have any effect and the confidence game collapses.
       This moment will be known as the end of the industrial revolution
       by the few who survive.
       This is not a Hollywood movie where the hero saves the day. This is
       the reality we are facing.

       The use of the phrase "political markets" says a lot about Rogoff,
       and all the other orthodox capitalist economists. I presume he meas
       that elections are another sort of market with politicians as
       producers and voters as consumers. No politician or party has
       developed the right product--policy regarding food--for the
       market--the consumer/voter.
       This parodying of politics fits the notion that capitalism is a
       natural phenomenon and that only a state that is fundamentally
       oriented towards protecting property is, likewise, natural. This
       flies in the face of the reaity of the only sustained period of
       solid, BROAD BASED economic well being, the period of the
       1940's-1970's in Europe and the US. Picketty shows how this period
       is an aberration from capitalism, and the normal bourgeois
       domination of the state was briefly suspended. That has come to an
       end without question s we zoom rapidly backwards toward the Gilded
       Age.
       Some decisive crisis, greater than the Great Recession will be
       necessary to orient the economy towards something other than
       transferring capitla from those who produce it--workers--to those
       who don't, "owners."

       We are in an unprecedented state none of those great thinkers,
       philosophers, economists could foresee, or even if they suspected
       it they never experienced "in the flesh".
       All our past and present ideology, methods, toolbox is based on a
       linear world, where individuals, nations are at least partially
       independent from each other, as if living side by side in a space
       of their own, and also in which linear world model there are no
       limits to growth, where we can simply continue expanding,
       exploring, exploiting both human and natural resources in order to
       gain more profit infinitely.
       The whole constant quantitative growth global economy and the
       supporting political structure is based on that.
       And despite the global crisis showing us day by day that our
       previous calculations, even Nobel prize winning methods have become
       dysfunctional, moreover harmful, we want to ignore this as a "bug"
       in the software and we try pushing on with the same stubbornly like
       a child hoping that at the next attempt by some miracle it will
       work again.
       The totally interconnected and interdependent global, and integral
       world is nothing we have ever experienced.
       All the ruthless competition driving our previous and present
       structure has become exactly as destructive as a cancer in a normal
       body.
       In a global, integral system only globally mutual complementing
       cooperation can succeed.
       In such a system there are no friends and foes, regardless of
       historical or presumed antagonism, rejection and hatred each and
       every nation and individual is tied together as cogwheels without
       any truly free movement.
       A move of a finger or even a single thought already influences the
       whole system.
       It is a scary situation since it means that without knowing the
       whole system, all of its parts and their reactions we must not
       initiate, inject any new ideas or action as the consequences could
       be catastrophic.
       This is not a theory or philosophy any more we can watch it live,
       or read about it in the news every day.
       This is not something that might happen to us in the future but we
       are already existing in this system which is not man-made, but
       evolutionary.
       Which means we cannot change it but we have to adapt by learning
       about it, educating ourselves and changing our environment
       accordingly.
       And this is where our precious human uniqueness, our capability of
       critical self-assessment and self-change comes into play.
       Never before did we use this as we simply floated instinctively
       forward, our inherently self-centered and egoistic nature driving
       us.
       But from now on we have to ride on top of this nature as a skilled
       rodeo rider in order to use its force but in the right direction,
       in adapting to the global integral, natural system we live in.

            If economics is to be like physics, then it would pursue the
            microcosm of human relationships first -- i.e., the atomic
            theory of economics is behavioral economics. However, as
            Albert Einstein once pointed out, physics great power of
            explanation lies in the fact that it seeks to understand the
            fundamental principles of physical reality and in exchange has
            gladly sacrificed any hope of describing truly complex
            phenomenon.
            Applying superstring models to even a simple molecule would be
            a task well beyond what a physicist today would even consider.
            Economist can't avoid complexity--but try to. They imagine
            that simple man made models of a limited number of terms like
            some quantum wave equation, will describe the rapidly evolving
            global economy. But with all due respect to Douglas Adams, the
            secret of life, the universe, and everything, is not 42 -- it
            is outside the ken of individual economists, or even armies of
            them. The Internet is today kind of a large component in
            economics is it not? Well at 50 million nodes it was
            determined that no reasonable, meaningful model of its
            dynamics could be formulated anymore. There are now about 2
            billion such nodes. And of course, this is the tip of the
            iceberg in terms of climatic effects, sociological patterns,
            etc., etc., etc. Simple symmetries are rapidly disappearing
            and being replaced by deterministic chaos.
            This doesn't mean the matter is hopeless, because like Douglas
            Adams's Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy Deep Thought
            computer, we have a vast computational tool that can grab the
            chaotic bull by the horns and tame it. And this too is called
            Global Integral Humanity. That is, we must become like evolved
            communities throughout nature into a single holistic ("swarm")
            intelligence. This is not science fiction, but rather a
            reality that must unfold between us all. A true integral
            education and taking the societal steps necessary to reach a
            state of mutual responsibility as mimicked in lower life
            forms, is precisely the behavioral links -- the behavioral
            economics -- that we need to make.
            Economists, psychologists, and teachers do have their work cut
            out for them, but first they must begin thinking out of the
            box on a scale never before seen. They must stop rehashing the
            same toy models of vastly simplistic model, but rather work
            simple principles of understanding and care between human
            beings to create the vast economist that can handle the true
            complexity that we face.
