Boeing blames pilots for Asiana 777 crash; airline faults software, too

   Asiana Airlines 777 in San Francisco, telling the National
   Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) that the crash “would have been
   avoided had the flight crew followed procedures.”

   Boeing on Monday firmly blamed the pilots for last year’s crash of an
   Asiana Airlines 777 in San Francisco, telling the National
   Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) that the crash “would have been
   avoided had the flight crew followed procedures.”

   “This accident occurred due to the flight crew’s failure to monitor and
   control airspeed, thrust level and glide path,” Boeing said in a
   document submitted for the agency’s investigation of last July’s crash
   in which three passengers died.

   Asiana partly agreed with Boeing in its own submission to the NTSB, but
   it also found fault with the design of the jet’s automated flight
   controls.

   The South Korean carrier wrote that “the probable cause of this
   accident was the flight crew’s failure to monitor and maintain a
   minimum safe airspeed during a final approach.”

   However, its report cites factors it says contributed to the crash,
   including the logic built into the plane’s autothrottle software.

   Boeing and Asiana agree that as the pilots came in to land, they
   expected the autothrottle to automatically supply engine thrust to
   maintain a minimum airspeed. In fact, in the flight mode they had
   engaged, the onus was on them to maintain the speed.

   Asiana also faulted the cockpit alerting systems as providing
   “inadequate warning” that the speed had dropped dangerously low.

   The discrepancy between the airline and the jet-maker pivots around
   Boeing’s flight-control design philosophy, cited in its submission as
   requiring “the pilot always has the final authority over any automation
   system.”

   In an earlier NTSB hearing in December, Boeing staunchly defended this
   automation-control design.

   The issue will now come under intense NTSB scrutiny as the agency does
   its final report on the July 6 crash.

   Because the airport’s instrument-landing system was out of service that
   day due to construction, pilots had no digital glide path in the sky to
   follow. They had to manually land planes.

   But Asiana Flight 214 from Seoul, with 307 people aboard, came in too
   low and, traveling at 120 mph, clipped the seawall short of the runway.
   The main landing gear and the tail of the big jet sheared off.

   Six people were thrown from the back of the jet when the tail detached.
   Three of them died. These were passengers in a rear row of seats; none
   was wearing a seat belt.

   The other three, who were seriously injured, were flight attendants
   strapped into their seats at the rear of the plane for the landing.

   Meanwhile, the rest of the plane slid along the ground, bounced, spun
   330 degrees and hit the ground again.

   The passenger cabin remained largely intact, enabling the remaining
   passengers and crew to survive.

   As the plane came to a stop, the right engine caught fire. Everyone was
   evacuated on slides before the fire spread to the passenger cabin and
   burned through the fuselage.

   The twin accounts by Boeing and Asiana largely agree on the events
   leading up to that deadly conclusion.

   While approaching the airport, at about 1,600 feet, the pilot
   apparently accidentally selected an automated mode called Flight Level
   Change, which directed the autopilot to climb to a higher level.

   To correct this error and cancel the climb, the crew disconnected the
   autopilot and manually pulled the throttles back to idle.

   Boeing’s design philosophy interpreted this action as a manual override
   of the autothrottle by the crew.

   In other situations, for example cruising at 35,000 feet, the
   autothrottle will automatically come alive and increase thrust if the
   airspeed falls too low.

   But at that moment on Flight 214, with the assumption that the pilot
   had taken control of thrust, the Boeing control logic transitioned the
   autothrottle to hold mode, meaning it was ready to adjust the thrust
   again only if commanded to do so by the pilot’s actions.

   At this point, the autothrottle had ceded control to the pilots, but
   the crew had lost touch with what was happening.

   With the engines at idle and the autothrottle on hold, the crew didn’t
   monitor the jet’s speed.

   Doug Rice, a veteran commercial-airline pilot and a board member of the
   California Pilots Association, said foreign flight crews often lack
   manual flying experience.

   He believes the Asiana pilots were unable to cope that day with the
   fact that the instrument-landing equipment was out.

   “It wasn’t like it was dangerous,” Rice said. “It was a beautiful day.
   And they didn’t fly the airplane.

   “They didn’t miss their touchdown target by a little bit,” he added.
   “They missed by a third of a mile.”

   In the December NTSB hearing, John Cashman, the test pilot who flew the
   777 maiden flight in 1994, defended Boeing’s flight-control logic.

   “It goes back to that original philosophy: not changing modes in an
   autopilot that the pilot doesn’t command,” Cashman said.

   He said the pilot has to have the authority, should he see oncoming
   traffic or some other reason to change course, to fully control the
   airplane.

   Asiana mentions in its submission that this precise situation arose
   during a test flight of a 787 Dreamliner, which has the same
   flight-control logic.

   In that instance, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) test pilot
   questioned the fact that the autothrottle didn’t wake up automatically
   when the speed dropped.

   But an FAA manager at the December hearing testified that after
   discussions with Boeing “the FAA pilot determined that the fact that
   the autothrottle did not wake up was not a safety issue.”

   Asiana recommends in its submission to the NTSB that Boeing insert more
   explicit warnings in its flight-crew training manuals about this
   specific circumstance and also that it should develop stronger alerting
   features to mitigate any automation “surprise.”

   Rice said such steps, rather than changing the logic of Boeing’s
   flight-control philosophy, is the right response.

   “I don’t believe the philosophy needs changed,” said Rice. “We need to
   make sure the pilots understand the philosophy and they must
   demonstrate that knowledge during their training.”

   The San Francisco crash was the first fatal accident of a 777. The NTSB
   investigation continues and will eventually produce recommendations.

   There appears to be no link to what happened with the missing Malaysian
   777 lost in March.
