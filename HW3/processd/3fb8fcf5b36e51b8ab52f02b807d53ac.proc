DOJ Says Company That Vetted Snowden Faked 665,000 Background Checks

from the well-of-course dept

   When we last checked in on USIS, the contracting firm which large parts
   of the federal government and the intelligence community used to
   conduct background checks on employees (including Ed Snowden), we noted
   that it had been caught falsifying reports and claiming to have
   interviewed dead people. At the time, we noted at least one USIS
   employee had been accused of submitting 1,600 falsified credit reports.
   But, apparently, the story goes much, much deeper. The DOJ is now
   accusing USIS of faking background checks on 665,000 federal employees.
   Not only that, but the practice of scamming the government seems to
   have been the official policy of the organization, clearly described in
   various emails. Basically, USIS was paid based on each completed
   background check, and realized it was a lot more profitable to
   "complete" them by not doing most of the actual work (pricey!) and just
   take the money (profits!).

     Beginning in at least March 2008 and continuing through at least
     September 2012, USIS management devised and executed a scheme to
     deliberately circumvent contractually required quality reviews of
     completed background investigations in order to increase the
     company’s revenues and profits. Specifically, USIS devised a
     practice referred to internally as “dumping” or “flushing,” which
     involved releasing cases to OPM and representing them as complete
     when, in fact, not all ROIs comprising those cases had received a
     quality review as required by the Fieldwork Contracts.
     USIS engaged in the practice of dumping in order to meet budgeted
     goals and, therefore, increase its revenues and profits. Given that
     USIS was paid by OPM for each completed case, the more cases USIS
     completed each month the more money it received from OPM. USIS’s
     dumping practices also enabled the company to receive annual
     performance incentive payments that it would not otherwise have been
     entitled to receive absent the dumping

   Oh, and it became so profitable, they set up a computer program to help
   them defraud the government and not complete background checks. No
   joke.

     Initially, USIS would dump cases manually. Soon after the dumping
     started, however, USIS began using a software program called Blue
     Zone to assist in the dumping practices. Through Blue Zone, USIS was
     able to identify a large number of background investigations,
     quickly make an electronic “Review Complete” notation indicating
     that the ROIs at issue had gone through the review process even if
     they had not, and then automatically release all of those ROIs to
     OPM with the “Review Complete” notation attached. By using Blue
     Zone, USIS was able to substantially increase the number of
     background investigations that could be dumped in a short time
     period.

   You have to hand it to them. Not only did they figure out how to scam
   the government, they sure as hell did it efficiently. That's the
   American spirit at work!
   In fact, it appears this became a key part of how USIS worked.
   Originally, it would only "dump" unfinished cases at the end of each
   day if it was behind schedule. But, later it realized it could get paid
   more by dumping these cases repeatedly during the day. No need to build
   up a queue, just dump... and get paid.
   The DOJ also has emails showing that senior management was well aware
   this was going on and even participated or encouraged the activity.

     Internal USIS documents confirm that USIS Senior Management was
     aware of and directed the dumping practices. For example, in one
     undated internal document, a USIS employee discussing the dumping
     practices stated: “They will dump cases when word comes from above,
     such as from [the President of Investigative Service Division] and
     [the President/CEO]. In the past, [the President of Investigative
     Service Division] and [the President/CEO] have told us to clear out
     our shelves in order to hit revenue. When this is done they will
     dump all [priority code] 6. If [the President of Investigative
     Service Division] and [the President/CEO] tell them they need to
     clear out more then they will dump [priority code] 5’s.... Last July
     through September we were dumping all [priority code] 4, 5, and 6’s
     per [the President of Investigative Service Division] and [the
     President/CEO].”
     Another email chain dated September 16 and 17, 2010 involving USIS’s
     Vice President of Field Operations and its President of
     Investigative Service Division, among others, discussed the need to
     dump cases to meet revenue goals. The Vice President of Field
     Operations referenced USIS’s revenue situation as “[w]e all own this
     baby, and right now we are holding one ugly baby.” The USIS Workload
     Leader in Western Pennsylvania forwarded that email to the Director
     of National Quality Assurance and the Quality Control Manager in
     Western Pennsylvania and responded: “The only two things we can do
     in review to get them out faster is to (a) hire or (b) dump.... I
     don’t know if there’s any other levers left to flip other than
     dumping everything we know is bad. Just a side note, the more MSPC
     [Master Scheduling Production Control] rams through, the more the
     field will transmit sub-standards, and the more [the number of cases
     needing secondary review] will go up. Come EOM [End of Month], if
     they’re going to tell us to just dump all those cases anyways
     without a proper review, which [sic] will only make that ugly baby
     even uglier...”

   There's also an email in which a "Workload Leader" tells the top
   "quality" assurance execs:

     "Shelves are as clean as they could get. Flushed everything like a
     dead goldfish."

   Oh, and another:

     "t'is Flushy McFlushershon at his merry hijinks again!! **leprechaun
     dance**...I'm not tired..."

   So, remember, folks, when Senator Dianne Feinstein insists the NSA
   would never abuse your privacy because they're professional, just
   realize that many of those "professionals" might not have actually gone
   through a background check, because it was taking away profits from a
   private contractor to actually do its job.

So...
       'Extensive oversight', huh? /s
       It was so widespread in the company they were cracking jokes about
       it, and the government only now finds out about it? Sounds like
       they owe Snowden for yet another thing, as I doubt this would have
       been uncovered if his actions hadn't caused them to more closely
       examine the various programs, though I'm sure they'll instead just
       get even angrier at him, since by NSA cheerleader logic the problem
       'didn't exist' when people didn't know about it.
       And of course the big question is, 'Now what?'
       The company has been caught falsifying background checks,
       background checks on people that were then hired into sensitive,
       secure government positions, positions that have access to
       classified, valuable, or otherwise sensitive
       documentation/information, and assuming the government doesn't just
       try and brush it under the rug(which I fully expect them to do),
       that means they're going to have to pay, again, to have all those
       people checked again(though hopefully by another company this
       time), so what penalty is the company going to face?
       Personally I expect there to be a decent amount of noise without
       substance, a good amount of fake outrage, and maybe a few lower
       ranked employees thrown under the bus as examples, while all the
       higher ups remain untouched, or perhaps 'resign'(with huge bonuses
       of course), without a single one of them facing charges for their
       actions, because once you're rich enough, and/or have the right
       connections, the law just doesn't apply to you anymore in this(and
       several other) country.

I'm sure they are professional.
       After all, there's professional hitmen and professional criminals,
       so, I'm pretty sure that the people working for the NSA are the
       very definition of Professional.
       Professional what, on the other hand, I don't know.

       1. Make background check to government.
       2. Lie to government. (formerly ???)
       3. Profit!
       And it only took this long for government to figure it out.

       Not to purposefully make this political but...
       isn't stuff like this exactly what Libertarians say WOULDN'T happen
       in a pure and free economy?
       If we didn't have any centralized group controlling things,
       problems like this would be even more wide spread with maybe little
       chance of catching them.
       People are greedy assholes who will suck at the overly large teet
       of the government. Because they can get away with it.
       I still stand by the statement that the inherent size of "our"
       government isn't inherently the problem. The problem comes from the
       complete lack of accountability at basically every level.
       Act like this is a big news story(which is very well should be) but
       in a week this will be replaced with Biber getting prole, the next
       Zimmerman, or the Super Bowl. There is no accountability because we
       the people as a whole don't ask for it.
       That is the biggest shame of them all.

       The US Gov is all about letting corporations "maximize profits" off
       it's citizens, but the second it happens to them, suddenly it's a
       "bad" thing.
       I find it ironic that the USIS executives, had all the contents of
       their emails recorded. Didn't the US Gov said they only look at
       "metadata", not the "contents" of communications?
       More lies!

       Internet Zen Master (profile), Jan 27th, 2014 @ 10:00am

Regardless of what you think of Snowden
       It can't be denied that his decision to blow the whistle on the NSA
       uncovered more and more corruption, feels like a rather pleasant
       side effect for something that's "jeopardized national security".
       At the very least, now the NSA will (hopefully) be getting new
       employees that deserve their security clearances in the future
       (Granted, from a government standpoint, they should just drop all
       contracting work from the intelligence community altogether and
       keep everything in-house, but that's not likely to happen any time
       soon).
       Of course, this assumes the DOJ is actually going to go after the
       US IS and it's execs, and not let them slip away unharmed like
       they've done so far with the scumbags over in Wall Street.
       As the Zen Master says, "We'll see."

       You would think that the organization collecting all communication

       selecting them as a contractor.

       I don't really want to defend a company that has been lying to the
       DOJ about a program they were running that was illegal,
       unscrupulously hidden from them, and not in the best interest of
       the people of the United States, but didn't the DOJ sort-of say
       that this kind of behavior was ok when they did the same thing to

Hehe
       Does anyone else see the irony here?
       The government hires USIS to perform background checks on its
       employees. The USIS sends emails about not doing it's job, and it's
       only AFTER the Snowden leaks that the NSA finds out.
       now the DOJ miraculously has emails incriminating the USIS.
       Interesting.
       It's not that they didn't have enough information, it's that they
       didn't connect the dots. Again. (the NSA presumably had all of
       USIS's emails the whole time!)
       Dang, Snowden is helping more people than he could have ever
       realized, INCLUDING the NSA!

       They were looking for Snowden's background check I bet and the only
       way to they can try to prove him to be a bad person was to recheck
       his background , It'll come out that he was on the flushy list so
       they can try to curtail his professionalism.

       There is no accountability because the people who should do the

       have been overseeing because to admit they were scammed is to admit

An obvious and easy way to prevent this
       There is a simple way to prevent this from happening again.
       Next time you are looking for a contractor to do background checks
       to vet people, first hire a contractor to vet the contractors you
       propose to hire.
       Then you could take that to the next level. A contractor to vet a
       contractor to vet a contractor to vet people. Etc.
       It helps eat up unspent budgets. It helps create jobs. It does
       things in the correct bureaucratic way. What's not to like?

       I guess this is why the government needs to keep tabs on just what
       the people they pay to do stuff are doing
       Then again, odds are if they tried to do that, they'd just hire
       some outside company to do it, and the company would just claim
       they're doing it while actually just pocketing the money.
       So maybe they could hire USIS to keep an eye on USIS to make sure
       that USIS is doing the job they're being paid to do?

Re:
       And why wouldn't it happen in a free economy? I don't see any
       hindrance there, except of course, that the government decided to
       outsource something it shouldn't have in the first place, and which
       it could only outsource because the lax privacy laws allowed it.
       If private data about citizens is kept private, a company can't
       just "do background checks", because it won't get any. So the
       government has to do it itself. Which it should do anyway, because
       this is about clearances to secrets.
       Which brings me to another point: classifying is completely broken.
       If you need 2 million people with "secret" clearances (and those
       people need them, lest they can't do their jobs), there is
       something seriously wrong with what _the people_ allow the
       government to "classify".
       Overclassification is the enemy. The solution is to be transparent,
       and if you're embarrassed about blatantly fostering the agenda of
       the MPAA via your consulates, then don't friggin do it!

Re: Hehe
       I was thinking something along those same lines. How exactly did
       they get the "internal USIS documents"? Did they simply ask them
       for them or did they just have someone steal them? So taking
       internal documents that show impropriety from an entity and then
       releasing them to expose that impropriety is okay when the entity
       is someone else but when someone takes their documents to prove
       their impropriety, then they get pissed and want him murdered for
       it. Pot & Kettle.

Great!
       I think this means 665,000 analysts and the like will have to sit
       in a room and not do intelligence work until they can be granted
       legitimate clearances. That is bound to slow down the surveillance
       state, at least for a while. The alternative is for the bureaucracy
       to admit these clearances really don't mean anything anyway.

       Sadly, the NSA has nothing to do with this, other than having one
       known contractor who was vetted by USIS (as well as the Navy Yards
       shooter.)
       USIS was a contractor for the U.S. Office of Personnel Management
       (OPM), which performs background checks required for security
       clearances for *ALL* Federal employees (including those who work at
       the NSA.) [Source NBC Article linked to above.]

Re: Re: Hehe
       I was thinking something along those same lines. How exactly did
       they get the "internal USIS documents"?
       I suspect, based on my very limited experience here, the DoJ
       discovered a bunch of questionable background investigations and
       decided to subpoena the company for any internal documents relating
       to the process of performing background checks. The company,
       instead of pulling a Enron (shredding the documents,) decided it
       was in their best interest to come clean and cooperate (especially,
       since, they say that all of the employees involved have been fired
       or no longer work for the company.) It is entirely possible that
       someone within the company blew the whistle, but not necessarily so
       (the article doesn't say whether the whistle was blown or whether
       it was a result of a subpoena.)
       So taking internal documents that show impropriety from an entity
       and then releasing them to expose that impropriety is okay when the
       entity is someone else but when someone takes their documents to
       prove their impropriety, then they get pissed and want him murdered
       for it.
       I see where you are coming from, but at least in this place it can
       be that they didn't actually release them, but they were attached
       to a subpoena which is public records as part of a court case. The
       civil lawsuit was already filed against the USIS by the DoJ in
       Alabama, and except in certain cases, most lawsuits and their
       associated documentation are available to the public.

Re: Re: Re: Hehe
       the article doesn't say whether the whistle was blown or whether it
       was a result of a subpoena.
       Oops...missed that part. From the article:
       The civil lawsuit was filed by the Justice Department under the
       False Claims Act. The department adopted claims previously made
       under seal by Blake Percival, identified as the director of
       Fieldwork Services at USIS between 2001 and 2011. The suit accuses
       the company of filing false claims, making false statements and
       breach of contract.
       Percival originally filed a whistleblower lawsuit in 2011 alleging
       that the Northern Virginia-based firm expedited checks in bulk
       using the Blue Zone software on checks that were never actually
       performed, according to the DOJ complaint.
       So yes, a whistleblower was involved.

Stop picking on those misunderstood People!!
       Why even complain when you know its all a big mistake and USIS
       really didn't mean to do anything illegal. I'm SURE all of the
       millions they made in the process went to the poor and charities.
       You cannot convince me that USIS are not complete angels. I'm sure
       they are in the running for a new and improved Govt. contract that
       will make them even richer!
       Don't worry about sending them to jail because when they finally
       respond to the public, it will be to say 'i am deeply sorry for
       taking your taxpayer money and buying this new house'. If they
       don't keep a straight face, i'm sure its because they heard a good
       joke just moments before, and not because they think the Govt is a
       joke and the taxpayers deserve to be ripped off.

       I live in the DC area and have sat through security interviews for
       my neighbors countless times. The quality really varies. We've had
       actual FBI agents show up at the door. However, usually it's a
       contractor, probably USIS. The "investigators" are young kids,
       likely in their first job out of college. They roll through their
       list of questions, barely listening to the answers, just trying to
       check off the interview as done so they can move on to the next
       one.
       It's no way to run a security organization.

Next?
       So we're given the information that the USIS was performing
       fraudulent background checks, and billing for it.
       Of course we won't go into the number of people they passed as
       being 'clean' and who are actually convicted criminals..no, that
       would be too uncomfortable to think about.

       Like it or not, you cant have just a lil bit of freedom or a lil
       bit of security, between the two, its one or the other, both have
       benefits, both have cons, with freedom, you may lose security in
       the scale we have today, with security you may lose freedom in the
       scale we had in the past

       The only way the DoJ found out was because of whistleblowers.
       Again, the NSA has nothing to do with this story other than they
       had a contractor who was reviewed by USIS and then allegedly blew
       the whistle on NSA (we all know he did, the allegedly is clearly
       here for legal reasons.)
       That and also clearing the Navy Yards shooter, who was clearly
       having mental issues, and the dozen or so Federal employees with
       financial conflicts such as not paying their taxes for a number of
       years.

Re: Re:
       Gen0wl is pointing to the issue of leaving competitive markets to
       fight over government contracts.
       In the case of background checks for the NSA, the USIS might have
       been the most efficient & cost effective player -- but primarily
       because they were half-arsing the job & nobody audited, noticed,
       reported, cared enough, put their neck out.
       Over-classification? Over-simplification. What if the NSA had
       exactly 2 buckets (announcements Vs secrets) and only 2 employees
       are doing all the classifying -- now, do you care that you still
       don't get to know the size of the bucket labelled Secrets, nor how
       those 2 folks do their secretive job? Do you care whether or not
       your government gets to peer at the secrets "sometimes" (we wont
       say exactly when) without first obtaining a warrant? Do you care
       that some secrets are classified as forever-secrets? Whether we can
       or cant announce examples of how "secret keeping" has safe lives?
       When we blend public-surveillance with targeted-surveillance, then
       the deep-dark secrets become less concerning than the deeper-darker
       secrecy surrounding the the necessary gagging and self-serving
       psychology of employees within NSA, FBI, other US government
       departments (and their "partners" like USIS) etc etc etc.

Re:
       Thank you, Geno0wl. This is why I often get into arguments with
       them. In the purest, biggest-L sense, they are basically
       anti-communist. Since they are doing the polar opposite of
       communism without actually thinking it through, they make the same
       intellectual failures as any ideologue makes, which is to assume
       that everyone on their team, if they stick to "the plan," can't go
       wrong.
       This means that evidence of ideological purity is conflated with
       moral purity followed by frantic denial and squeals of indignation
       when human nature makes itself clear, i.e. if a situation can be
       abused, it will be.
       For this reason I am skeptical that any one ideology can, by
       itself, when "properly" put into practice, save us. Life just
       doesn't work that way.

Profit Above All
       This is what you get when you outsource the running of the
       government to for profit companies. Of course those companies are
       going to put profit before anything else. It is their entire reason
       for existing.
       Sure government is bureaucratic and slow, but for some things, like
       background checks and security clearances, that is exactly what you
       want. The old school, cold war era security agency guy must either
       be cringing or spinning in their graves.
