   Data Science Summer School

   The Data Science Summer School (DS3) is an intensive, eight-week
   hands-on introduction to data science for college students in the New
   York City area. As we are committed to increasing diversity in computer
   science, we strongly encourage women, minorities, and individuals with
   disabilities to apply.

   Each student receives a $5,000 stipend for participating in the
   program, as well as a laptop.

   DS3 includes both course work in data science and group research
   projects. The summer school is taught by leading scientists at
   Microsoft Research, and is held at the new Microsoft Research office in
   the heart of New York City.
