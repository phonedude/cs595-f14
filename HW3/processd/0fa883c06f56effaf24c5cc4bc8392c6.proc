     Congress Quietly Deletes a Key Disclosure of Free Trips Lawmakers Take

House Ethics reverses decades of precedent as lobbyist-sponsored lawmaker travel
expands.

   It's going to be a little more difficult to ferret out which members of
   Congress are lavished with all-expenses-paid trips around the world
   after the House has quietly stripped away the requirement that such
   privately sponsored travel be included on lawmakers' annual
   financial-disclosure forms.

   The move, made behind closed doors and without a public announcement by
   the House Ethics Committee, reverses more than three decades of
   precedent. Gifts of free travel to lawmakers have appeared on the
   yearly financial form dating back its creation in the late 1970s, after
   the Watergate scandal. National Journal uncovered the deleted
   disclosure requirement when analyzing the most recent batch of yearly
   filings.

   "This is such an obvious effort to avoid accountability," said Melanie
   Sloan, executive director of the watchdog group Citizens for
   Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. "There's no legitimate reason.
   There's no good reason for it."

   Free trips paid for by private groups must still be reported separately
   to the House's Office of the Clerk and disclosed there. But they will
   now be absent from the chief document that reporters, watchdogs, and
   members of the public have used for decades to scrutinize lawmakers'
   finances.

   "The more you can hide, the less accountable you can be," Sloan said of
   lawmakers. "It's clear these forms are useful for reporters and
   watchdogs, and obviously a little too useful."

   House Ethics Committee Chairman Michael Conaway, R-Texas, did not
   return a call for comment; ranking member Linda Sanchez, D-Calif.,
   referred questions to committee staff. The committee declined to
   comment.

   The change occurs as free travel, which critics have criticized as
   thinly veiled junkets, has come back into vogue. Last year, members of
   Congress and their aides took more free trips than in any year since
   the influence-peddling scandal that sent lobbyist Jack Abramoff to
   prison. There were nearly 1,900 trips at a cost of more than $6 million
   last year, according to Legistorm, which compiles travel records.

   Now none of those trips must be included on the annual disclosures of
   lawmakers or their aides.

   The tabs for these international excursions can run into the tens of
   thousands of dollars. One trip to Australia earlier this year cost
   nearly $50,000. Lawmakers are often invited to bring along their
   husbands or wives, fly in business class, and stay in plush four-star
   hotels. In the wake of the Abramoff scandal, lobbyists were banned from
   organizing or paying for these travels. But some of the nonprofits
   underwriting them today have extremely close ties to lobbying groups,
   including sharing staff, money, and offices.

   The only indication that these trips no longer need to be disclosed on
   annual reports came in the instructions booklet issued to lawmakers in
   2014. The guidelines for the new electronic filing system tell
   lawmakers and staff they "are no longer required to report privately
   sponsored travel" on the form.

   Perhaps because the ethics committee's edict was issued so quietly,
   disclosure remained uneven.

   For instance, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, who led a GOP
   delegation of lawmakers to Israel last summer paid for by the American
   Israel Education Foundation, which is closely tied to the pro-Israel
   lobby, did not include the trip on his annual form. House Minority Whip
   Steny Hoyer, who led a similar trip for Democrats, did include it on
   his form. But some of the rank-and-file members who went on the trip
   with Hoyer did not.

   Craig Holman, a lobbyist for the consumer group Public Citizen who
   closely tracks the international travels of lawmakers and the actions
   of the Ethics Committee, said he was "completely unaware" of the change
   until contacted by National Journal.

   "There's seems to be no reason I could imagine why the Ethics Committee
   would minimize the amount of information that gets reported," Holman
   said.

   Holman took solace in the fact that the post-Abramoff reform law
   included mandatory disclosure of such trips on the clerk's website. But
   he said he was still was concerned about their absence from the annual
   reports, which he called "a critical element for understanding the
   finances of our elected representatives."

   "It's always good to have more disclosure than less," he said. "It just
   seems a little odd that the Ethics Committee would pass such a rule
   change."
