   By Andy Greene | July 1, 2014

   We're now just a week away from the release of CSNY 1974. Over the past
   few weeks, Rolling Stone has debuted David Crosby's "Almost Cut My
   Hair," Stephen Stills' "Change Partners" and Graham Nash's "Pre-Road
   Downs." It's now time for our final premiere, and you probably figured
   out by the pattern who's next. Here's Neil Young's "Only Love Can Break
   Your Heart" live in 1974.

   IFRAME:
   https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/track
   s/155885110%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-pyYCI&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_

   The song originally appeared on After The Gold Rush, but was first
   played live at a Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young concert in May of 1970.
   It was a perfect track for the quartet's lush harmonies and became a
   regular highlight of the 1974 reunion tour as well as the group's 2006
   Freedom of Speech outing.

   The Oral History of CSNY's Infamous 'Doom Tour'

   Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young last performed at the 2013 Bridge School
   Benefit, but they haven't toured in eight years. Graham Nash holds out
   hope they'll hit the road at least one more time. "I just want to let
   people know what great music we could make because drugs are out of the
   way now," he told Rolling Stone last year. "Stephen and David are
   totally straight now, and so alive! It would be fantastic. That's what
   would happen in my perfect world."

   The tour came at a time when Young was writing songs at a furious pace,
   and he often tried out new material on stage, playing some songs only a
   handful of times. CSNY 1974 preserves such rarities as "Love Art
   Blues," "Pushed It Over The End" and "Don't Be Denied." The rarest
   track is "Goodbye Dick," a song they played August 14th, 1974 at the
   Nassau Coliseum, just five days after President Richard Nixon resigned
   in disgrace.

   Fans can finally check out CSNY 1974 when it hit shelves on July 8th.
   The album will be available in a variety of formats, including a 3
   CD/DVD set, a Pure Audio Blu-Ray (192kHz/24-bit) and a 16-track single
   CD. Many of the sets will have a 188-page booklet, and there will also
   be a limited edition set of 1,000 copies featuring a coffee table-sized
   book and six 180-gram 12‚Äù vinyl records. A pre-order of CSNY 1974 is
   available on the band's website.
