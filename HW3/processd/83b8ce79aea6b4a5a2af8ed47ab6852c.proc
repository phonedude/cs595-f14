   (02-18) 18:02 PST SAN FRANCISCO -- Peering out from behind the cool
   glow of iPads and MacBook Pros, some students sit with rapt attention.
   A few appear lost in daydreams, or perhaps just lost. At least two
   cruise Facebook.

   It is a predictable college scene, but this Berkeley computer science
   class is at the vanguard of a tech world shift. The class has 106 women
   and 104 men.

   The gender flip first occurred last spring. It was the first time since
   at least 1993 - as far back as university enrollment records are
   digitized - that more women enrolled in an introductory computer
   science course. It was likely the first time ever.

   It's a small but a significant benchmark. Male computer science majors
   still far outnumber female, but Professor Dan Garcia's class is a sign
   that efforts to attract more women to a field where they have always
   been vastly underrepresented are working.

   "We are starting to see a shift," said Telle Whitney, president of the
   Anita Borg Institute for Women and Technology.

   Berkeley, Stanford and a handful of other universities have experienced
   a marked uptick in the numbers of female computer science students.
   Those increases have also coincided with a reimagining of computer
   science classes, especially introductory ones. In some cases, that
   meant doing away with aspects of classes that seemed to specifically
   discourage young women.

   For Garcia's course, which is for nonmajors, the goal was to expand the
   class beyond "just programming," to make it "kind of right-brained as
   well."

   Berkeley put more emphasis on the impact and relevance of computing in
   the world, and added pair exercises. Each class begins with a
   discussion of a recent tech-related news article. Introduction to
   Symbolic Programming was reborn as Beauty and the Joy of Computing.

   While redesigning the course wasn't strictly to attract women, said
   Garcia, "everything that turns women off, we reversed it."

   Attracting more women to computer science is invariably a good thing.
   Nationally, women earn 57 percent of bachelor's degrees, but only 12
   percent of computer science degrees, according to a 2009 report by the
   National Science Foundation. This comes as technology industries rank
   among the fastest growing in the nation. But the way schools choose to
   attract women can pose a challenge.

Gender-neutral models

   "It can be problematic to assume that all women are a certain way and
   therefore you should cater to that," said Sapna Cheryan, a University
   of Washington psychologist who has studied stereotypes in computer
   science. "What we do today to get girls in the classroom could have
   adverse affects on girls later."

   Cheryan pointed to "My Fair Physicist," a much-cited 2012 University of
   Michigan study that questioned whether having more feminine role models
   in science and math fields could counteract the discouraging stereotype
   that those fields are unfeminine. The study found that feminine role
   models actually reduced middle school girls' interest and perception of
   their own ability in math compared to more gender-neutral role models.

   For Sumer Mohammed, 21, Beauty and Joy of Computing got her hooked.
   Before registering, she knew nothing about programming, but decided
   based on her father's recommendation and the course title that "it
   might not be boring lines of code everywhere."

   Boring it was not.

   "It was so much fun. And very creative," said Mohammed, who took
   Garcia's class in 2011, the year after the revamp. She's now a bona
   fide convert: an electrical engineering and computer science major and
   a teaching assistant for Garcia's class. She is also spreading the
   gospel, having successfully convinced her roommate to minor in the
   concentration.

   The lack of women in tech has long been lamented by the industry -
   research has shown it would likely benefit economically, as well as
   socially, from an increased female presence.

   But problems persist in getting women to even consider the field an
   option.

   For one, there are few female role models and a massive misperception
   of the field among women. A 2008 study by the Association for Computing
   Machinery, consulted in designing the Berkeley course, found that while
   college-bound boys equated words like "interesting," "video games," and
   "solving problems" with computing, girls associated terms like
   "typing," "math" and "boredom."

Tackling misperceptions

   "Before I took Beauty and Joy I just thought computer science was
   people pent up in a room coding, looking like I look right before
   midterms," said Arany Uthanyakumar, 18, who took the Berkeley class
   last fall and also fell for it.

   And those same gendered perceptions of the tech world also mean that
   boys often get exposure to computing much younger than girls. Even if
   women do eventually get exposure to the field, the lag time can
   continue to be discouraging.

   "Even now, I still have the perception that they're better," said
   Mohammed. Many of the men in her class, she said, have years more
   experience.

   At Berkeley, the percentage of female computer science majors in the
   College of Letters and Science nearly doubled from 2009 to 2013, to 21
   percent.

   Stanford similarly revamped its computer science program to make it
   more widely attractive in 2008. Since then, female computer science
   enrollment has grown steeply, from 12.5 percent in 2008 to 21 percent
   in 2013.

   Harvey Mudd College, in Claremont (Los Angeles County), was among the
   first universities to dramatically increase its female computer science
   enrollment.

   "Girls say they won't like computer science, won't be good at it and
   don't want to associate with the people they think are good at it,"
   said college President Maria Klawe. "We've got to fix those three
   things: make it interesting, nonintimidating and obvious that the
   people who do this stuff are attractive, have good social skills and
   are not just dorks."

Interests differ

   Research has time and again found that there are some marked
   differences in what interests boys and girls in computing. Generally,
   girls care more about the creativity and potential to make an impact on
   the world.

   But there is a fine line between creating the perception that computer
   science isn't just for boys and the image that girls can do it because
   it's "girly" or less complicated.

   "It's this cycle. You're reinforcing an image of what is appropriate
   for girls," said Cheryan. "It's a tension between how do you get girls
   in now, but also what are you saying to future girls?"

   The title Beauty and Joy of Computing was inspired by a speech by IBM
   software engineer Grady Booch. But, noted Klawe, it does border on
   sending the message that the class is "a little fluffy."

   In the end, it was the perception that the class wasn't just pushing
   that masculine computing stereotype that got Mohammed, the Berkeley
   junior, in the door.

   "Before I really just saw it as one of those things boys do," she said.

On the rise
