“Learn to code” shouldn't be one-size-fits-all

   Everyone wants something different out of “coding” — maybe you want to
   make robots, or build a blog, or catalog Walt Whitman poems.

   Every one of those needs a different set of skills, and there's a good
   chance walking through a generic JavaScript tutorial won't get you
   there! (and it very well may bore you to death)

   So who better to ask what to learn than everyone?

Soooo, what should a newbie learn?

   It depends! Tumblr customizers might look for HTML and CSS, aspiring
   roboticists could check out Arduino, mapping aficionados might like
   TileMill. The list goes on and on!

   We're asking people from all walks of life to explain how they code and
   share the tools they use, so maybe you can get a leg up on the Right
   Stuff.

   Oh, and I don't want kernel hackers and musicians to get into
   fistfights, so just pretend "code" is in quotes all over the place.

Got a few minutes?

Whether it's Excel formulas or bit flipping, we'd love to hear how you code.
and heck, most all of the questions are optional anyway
