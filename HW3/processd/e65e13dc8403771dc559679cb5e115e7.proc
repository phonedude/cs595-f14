Do We Need Flame Retardants in Electronics?

   Disagreement burns over whether the chemicals in electronics are
   dangerous, or even provide any fire safety

   Fear of fires, especially from lit cigarettes, helped ignite the
   decades-long practice of adding fire retardant chemicals to furniture
   and other household items. But evidence that some of the chemicals
   could cause cancer or other health problems eventually led to a
   protracted fight to get them out of furniture. Now couches made in 2014
   could hit the market flame retardant–free. Their chemical cousins,
   however, are still routinely doused on today’s electronics.

   A smorgasbord of synthetic chemical retardants came of age in the era
   of boxy cathode-ray tube television and their bulky, flammable casings.
   Although electronics are now much smaller and thinner, flame retardants
   are still infused into or onto electronic circuit boards and casings.
   Less plastic casing means less fuel for a fire, but the use of highly
   flammable lithium ion batteries represents other risks, contend flame
   retardant proponents. And yet in recent years it’s become apparent that
   flame retardants used on furniture provide no meaningful protection. Is
   the story the same for our televisions, cell phones and laptops? The
   replies from experts continue to be divisive.

   The chemicals coating our electronics sometimes come with a disturbing
   profile. One common flame retardant used in the plastic casings of
   electronics, decabromodiphenyl ether, was voluntarily phased out by
   industry at the end of 2013 due to health and environmental concerns,
   including that it could potentially cause cancer or impact brain
   function. But some of the many alternatives that the U.S. Environmental
   Protection Agency anticipates will be used could degrade into
   tetrabromobisphenol A—itself a flame retardant that was labeled as a
   carcinogen by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences
   last year.

   Such chemicals are attractive because they are effective and cheap.
   Tapping more inherently fire resistant metals like titanium or steel
   for enclosures comes with a higher price tag, and companies may fear
   such products would be less attractive to users. Flame retardants have
   different chemical compositions and work in varying ways to slow a
   burn: some react to displace oxygen needed for a fire; others bind with
   molecules that would help feed the flames; others form a protective
   sheath on the surface of material that would otherwise be flammable.

   Flame retardants are chemically bound to the circuit boards of personal
   electronics during production—helping to keep any chemicals from
   seeping into the environment or possibly causing health repercussions
   for consumers (although it’s a different story for workers who process
   discarded electronics). The function of circuit boards is to transmit
   electrical current, so flame retardant proponents say fire protection
   is an obvious necessity.

   Flame retardants are also embedded in the plastic shells that encase
   circuitry and electronics, with potentially more alarming health
   impacts. They are added to the plastics during a late stage of
   manufacturing without bonding to or reacting with the product material,
   making it easier for them to leach into the environment.

   In general, industry is responsible for regulating its own acceptable
   fire risk in electronics. In the U.S. the electronics industry abides
   by voluntary consensus standards for keeping electronics from bursting
   into flames but there is no specification about what compounds must be
   used nor any limit (other than economics) on maximum use. Thanks to the
   Consumer Product Safety Act, the federal Consumer Product Safety
   Commission says it has the ability to enforce action on risky products
   if it hears about it. Indeed, the industry as a whole, or perhaps a
   company’s competitors, have an incentive to report unsafe products
   given that fires fueled by laptops or phones make for bad press, but
   this system is still self-policing.

   It is difficult for outside groups to gain insight into risk because
   companies typically do not share information on which flame retardants
   they use. “No manufacturer will tip their hands on what are in their
   products more than they have to,” for fear of competitors undercutting
   or reverse-engineering products, says Alexander Morgan, a fire
   scientist at the University of Dayton Research Institute and a member
   of the American Chemical Society . Even companies that say they are
   using one flame retardant may, even unbeknownst to them, be using small
   quantities of others if international subcontractors adulterate the
   products, he says.

   So are consumers being exposed to a smattering of flame retardants
   every time they whip out their phones or plop down in front of the
   television? The jury is still out. To date there is very little data on
   chemical leaching from these products. Some companies have preemptively
   turned to alternatives. Apple says it phased out all of its brominated
   flame retardants (BFRs) in 2008 (some of which are linked with maladies
   including cancer and adverse effects on fetal and child development);
   so newer iPads, iPods and iPhones should be free of such chemicals—but
   not all companies have followed suit. Apple says it instead uses a mix
   of more inherently fire resistant materials or safer flame-retarding
   alternative chemicals. Motorola says its products are BFR-free, too,
   and Sony says it has phased BFRs out of select products released after
   July 2013. Still, five other companies did not respond to requests for
   information from Scientific American by press time.

   There is no easy way for consumers to find out which products are free
   of flame retardant or to track the amount of retardants poured into or
   coating their electronics. EPA, for one, does not monitor the amount of
   flame retardants used in electronics.

   Moreover, the extent to which flame retardants are truly necessary to
   safeguard electronics is unclear. It’s difficult to discern who is
   right, especially when the stakes of being wrong could lead to serious
   consequences. “Maybe people don’t realize how flammable modern plastics
   are—even more than wood,” Morgan says.

   Yet “there has never been any valid statistical demonstration that
   flame retardant chemicals of the types and concentrations used in
   consumer products have resulted in death or injury reduction,” says
   Vytenis Babrauskas, the fire scientist whose work was distorted and
   cited for years as the grounds for flame retardant use in furniture.

   The Bromine Science and Environment Forum, a Brussels-based industry
   group, maintains that flame retardants in consumer products can save
   lives by preventing fires from starting or spreading. The argument is
   playing out in peer-reviewed literature as each study prompts fresh
   criticism. Arlene Blum, a longtime advocate on limiting flame retardant
   exposures and a visiting scholar in chemistry at the University of
   California, Berkeley, says there is no reason to use them in
   electronics casings.*
   For now the issue remains one in which the cure may be as hazardous as
   the illness it supposedly fights. “Ultimately,” Morgan says, “everyone
   has to live with some margin of risk.”
