Houston, We Have A Public Domain Problem

A bogus SoundCloud takedown reveals a much larger issue with private sites
and the public domain.
     __________________________________________________________________

   I received a bogus copyright takedown notice for using public domain
   audio on SoundCloud yesterday. The sound in question—the famous
   “Houston, we have a problem” snippet of the Apollo 13 mission—is
   incontrovertibly available to all, for any use, without copyright
   restrictions. The fact that it’s been yanked from my SoundCloud page,
   though, is a sad demonstration of how completely many online services
   have swallowed the fallacy that “unauthorized” means “unacceptable.”

   It’s a dangerous myth, that we should all need permission any time
   we’re getting value out of a piece of culture. And it’s one that gets
   entrenched deeper each time we accept the idea that we’re able to make
   use of a work because a copyright owner is or would be OK with it, and
   not just because we have a basic right to participate in culture that
   is more fundamental than anybody else’s desire to maximize profits.

   So I was disheartened when I got the takedown, and even more so when I
   looked through the guidelines for disputing an automatic match and
   found that I faced a presumption of guilt. There’s no option for “The
   work in question is not restricted by copyright,” or even “I am making
   a fair use.” Instead, the “valid reasons” offered are variations on the
   theme that I actually have permission—not that I never needed it in the
   first place.

   I am the primary copyright activist at the Electronic Frontier
   Foundation, a digital civil liberties organization. I witness takedown
   abuse every day. My case is not an anomaly and is, in fact, pretty
   tame: this was almost certainly a greedy mistake by somebody who knows
   there are unlikely to be negative consequences. It’s what’s known as
   copyfraud, but it’s not somebody deliberately targeting my upload and
   misusing the copyright system as the handiest tool to take it down. (We
   see plenty of that, too.)

   The real goofy bit is that before I started at EFF, I worked at
   SoundCloud. I actually uploaded this Apollo 13 clip, along with sounds
   from Apollo 11 and others, as part of a project to attract more
   historic and archival audio and really celebrate the public domain as a
   rich source of sounds.

   But it’s true, our public domain has taken a beating. Through acts of
   Congress and unfortunate outcomes in Supreme Court cases, the steady
   expansion of our cultural commons has been largely replaced by
   stagnation.

   There are, of course, a few ways a work can end up in the public
   domain. Works of the US government are immediately and always free of
   copyright restrictions. Since that category includes recordings by
   NASA, my upload is a simple case. Beyond that, the public domain was
   once the default in the United States: unless you put a proper notice
   with a copyright sign and the year, and sent in a registration form and
   fee, your essay or film or recording or picture would never carry
   copyright restrictions at all.

   Even if works did get copyright status, the terms once granted would
   eventually expire. The result was a rich pool of common resources.

   Over the last forty years or so that has changed. For one thing, nearly
   all works are granted copyright restrictions automatically. As soon as
   a minimally original work of authorship is recorded—“fixed in a
   tangible medium,” is how the law puts it—it’s covered by copyright. On
   top of that, a 1998 law extended copyright terms for 20 years
   retroactively, meaning that no copyright on a published work has
   expired in the US for some 16 years. We’ve suffered a long drought,
   marked solemnly each January 1st—Public Domain Day—by thinking about
   what we could have had.

   And with that quantitative shift, there’s been a qualitative one, too.
   In decades past, the cultural treasures of each generation would be the
   common property of the next. Now we are limited to cultural works that
   date back nearly a full century; it’s not our fathers’ and mothers’
   culture, it’s our distant ancestors’.

   With that declining relevance, and the rising uncertainty caused by
   innocent mistakes and copyfraud, the public domain starts to look less
   like an inviting common meadow and more like a foreboding possible
   minefield. So here and there, in dribs and drabs, the public domain
   gets edited out of the picture.
     __________________________________________________________________

   We’ve lost a valuable chunk of the public domain, then, even without
   the complicity of online services. But those sites feel pressure, too:
   the minimum they must do to stay inside copyright “safe harbors” is
   prescribed by law, and many go further in efforts to be on good terms
   with media companies. That looks like overzealous algorithmic copyright
   enforcement, like the automated system that caught my upload after some
   partner presumably laid claim to it (and who knows how much else).

   Even as these companies and services strive to be massively accessible
   public spaces—SoundCloud bills itself as “the world’s leading social
   sound platform where anyone can create sounds and share them
   everywhere”—they reflect mostly corporate priorities, because they face
   far too little pressure from the other side. That is, from users who
   wish to participate in culture, and who don’t want to be treated like
   criminals.

   But that doesn’t have to be the case. I refuse to let this be an eulogy
   for the public domain. I choose to engage with it as an essential
   component of a participatory culture. It’s only if we forget how to use
   it that we could see it wither away. Even with its rough recent
   history, it deserves our attention, and our support.

   I’m sure my particular uploading situation will work out fine.
   SoundCloud is full of smart people, and this automated match will get
   cleared up in days, if not hours. But that’s ultimately an unsatisfying
   conclusion. The real problem is that we’ve bought into the rhetoric and
   the arguments that an unauthorized use is an unacceptable use. As a
   result our online services have looked less like the public platforms
   we want, and more like policed spaces where any activity can be
   interrogated for its papers, please.
