About Support and Privacy

   What is Support?

   What is “Supporting”?
   Supporting a Thunderclap campaign is like signing a petition but with
   the added power of simultaneously sharing a message. You and every
   other supporter are standing up for an idea with the power of your
   voice.
   How to support?

   How do I support?
   Choose between your Twitter, Facebook, or Tumblr account to grant
   Thunderclap permission to post a message on your behalf. That’s it! If
   the campaign reaches its support goal before the deadline, Thunderclap
   will automatically post your message along with everyone else who has
   supported.
   User privacy

   A note on privacy
   When you log into Thunderclap using your Twitter, Facebook, or Tumblr
   account, you’re allowing our platform to share a single message on your
   behalf. That’s all. We use the absolute minimum permissions possible to
   post a message on your behalf. The platforms we integrate with
   sometimes include additional permissions that we do not use and we will
   not post anything from your friends' accounts.

   (re)start the MaydayPAC

   On May 1, we launched the Mayday Citizens' SuperPAC — to reclaim a
   democracy held hostage by the funders of campaigns. We set a target of
   raising $1 million in 30 days.
   In 1.5 days, we had raised $300,000.
   The demand was so great, however, that our servers have melted. We've
   sent  in a crack team of geek volunteers to rebuild the site and make
   it better. When they're done, the site will be able to scale to as big
   as it needs to be, automatically.
   But we can't lose the incredible momentum that we saw starting out.
   So we're launching this Thunderclap to bring people back to the site
   when it can handle it again.
   Please join your friends, so that when we're live again, we can soar
   again. And if we're lucky, meet the 1 month goal in less than a week.

   Nothing to report!
