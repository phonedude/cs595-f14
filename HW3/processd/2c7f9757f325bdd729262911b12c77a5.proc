1×11: Internet of Thugs

   Jeremy Garcia, Stuart Langridge, The Invisible and Inaudible Ghost of
   Lunduke, and Jono Bacon present a new Bad Voltage, in which we discuss:
     * Our new series, Breaking Down The Bullshit where we delve into the
       current buzzwords and trends and determine if they are all hype or
       have substance. In this show, we discuss the Internet Of Things:
       crock of doo-doo or the future of technology?
     * Jeremy reviews the Withings WS-50 Smart Body Analyzer and we
       discuss it and the notion of measuring your body to get fit
     * Tim O’Reilly, founder of O’Reilly Media joins us to discuss print
       media, free culture, publishing, the Internet, privacy, and where
       the future is taking us
     * Jeremy and Jono saw Lawrence Lessig keynote recently, and we all
       discuss whether his ambitions of ridding governments of corruption
       is in any way possible
     * We talk about Bad Voltage community goings-on, on the forum, the
       chat channel, such as selfie contests, gaming servers, Bad Voltage
       apps and more!
