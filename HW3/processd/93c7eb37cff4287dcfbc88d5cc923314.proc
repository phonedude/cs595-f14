   How to Raise Moral Children
   I thought this article on child-raising had a lot of good ideas in it.
    There was stuff that was new to me, and stuff that was old, but the
   old stuff was worth reviewing, and the new research quite enlightening.
   Do read the article even if you don't have children. The principles it
   outlines apply to our lives as adults as well, to leadership in the
   workplace and in the world.  And while I've reproduced many of the best
   bits below, it's well worth going to the article itself, because it is
   heavily linked to the original research.
   What matters most is not achievement but caring
   The article opened with the familiar advice that "when parents praise
   effort rather than ability, children develop a stronger work ethic and
   become more motivated."  But it went from there in a surprising
   direction:
   "When people in 50 countries were asked to report their guiding
   principles in life, the value that mattered most was not achievement,
   but caring."
   Contrary to popular advice, praise of character is more effective than
   praise of behavior
   "Many parents believe it’s important to compliment the behavior, not
   the child — that way, the child learns to repeat the behavior. Indeed,
   I know one couple who are careful to say, 'That was such a helpful
   thing to do,' instead of, 'You’re a helpful person.'"
   But that's not what the research shows:
   "...A couple of weeks later, when faced with more opportunities to give
   and share, the children were much more generous after their character
   had been praised than after their actions had been. Praising their
   character helped them internalize it as part of their identities. The
   children learned who they were from observing their own actions: I am a
   helpful person. This dovetails with new research led by the
   psychologist Christopher J. Bryan, who finds that for moral behaviors,
   nouns work better than verbs. To get 3- to 6-year-olds to help with a
   task, rather than inviting them 'to help,' it was 22 to 29 percent more
   effective to encourage them to 'be a helper.' Cheating was cut in half
   when instead of, 'Please don’t cheat,' participants were told, 'Please
   don’t be a cheater.' When our actions become a reflection of our
   character, we lean more heavily toward the moral and generous choices.
   Over time it can become part of us."
   I think this is an important insight.  Internalizing our experiences
   and making them part of our identity is a key element of growing up.
   Note:  "by the time children turned 10, the differences between
   praising character and praising actions vanished: Both were effective.
   Tying generosity to character appears to matter most around age 8, when
   children may be starting to crystallize notions of identity."
   I will note that the advice for dealing with bad behavior (as opposed
   to good behavior) is just the opposite:  to emphasize the behavior, and
   not the character.  You don't want a kid to internalize the idea that
   he or she is a bad person!  That was the next key point, the
   distinction between guilt and shame.
   "If we want our children to care about others, we need to teach them to
   feel guilt rather than shame when they misbehave."
   This is a fascinating distinction:
   "When children cause harm, they typically feel one of two moral
   emotions: shame or guilt. Despite the common belief that these emotions
   are interchangeable, research led by the psychologist June Price
   Tangney reveals that they have very different causes and consequences.
   "Shame is the feeling that I am a bad person, whereas guilt is the
   feeling that I have done a bad thing. Shame is a negative judgment
   about the core self, which is devastating: Shame makes children feel
   small and worthless, and they respond either by lashing out at the
   target or escaping the situation altogether. In contrast, guilt is a
   negative judgment about an action, which can be repaired by good
   behavior. When children feel guilt, they tend to experience remorse and
   regret, empathize with the person they have harmed, and aim to make it
   right."
   ...
   "The most effective response to bad behavior is to express
   disappointment. According to independent reviews by Professor Eisenberg
   and David R. Shaffer, parents raise caring children by expressing
   disappointment and explaining why the behavior was wrong, how it
   affected others, and how they can rectify the situation. This enables
   children to develop standards for judging their actions, feelings of
   empathy and responsibility for others, and a sense of moral identity,
   which are conducive to becoming a helpful person. The beauty of
   expressing disappointment is that it communicates disapproval of the
   bad behavior, coupled with high expectations and the potential for
   improvement: 'You’re a good person, even if you did a bad thing, and I
   know you can do better.'"
   Children learn generosity not by listening to what their role models
   say, but by observing what they do.
   "In a classic experiment, the psychologist J. Philippe Rushton gave 140
   elementary- and middle-school-age children tokens for winning a game,
   which they could keep entirely or donate some to a child in poverty.
   They first watched a teacher figure play the game either selfishly or
   generously, and then preach to them the value of taking, giving or
   neither. The adult’s influence was significant: Actions spoke louder
   than words. When the adult behaved selfishly, children followed suit.
   The words didn’t make much difference — children gave fewer tokens
   after observing the adult’s selfish actions, regardless of whether the
   adult verbally advocated selfishness or generosity. When the adult
   acted generously, students gave the same amount whether generosity was
   preached or not — they donated 85 percent more than the norm in both
   cases. When the adult preached selfishness, even after the adult acted
   generously, the students still gave 49 percent more than the norm.
   Children learn generosity not by listening to what their role models
   say, but by observing what they do."
   So true.  As I said above, all of this applies to adults too. ﻿

   I enjoyed the article, too, and was struck by the distinction between
   achievement and caring ... and the benefits of praising of character
   vs. praising behavior (given earlier research on the risks of praising
   people vs. effort).
   The distinction between guilt and shame is also an important one ...
   and when combined with the idea that parents are always modeling for
   their children, I think it's important for parents to be mindful of our
   own feelings of guilt and/or shame, in our parenting and other
   activities. The ways in which we respond to such feelings will be
   passed on ... and if we are feeling shame about our children, we can
   get into a very negative feedback cycle.
   I agree with the idea expressed at the end of your annotations (and
   echoed in an earlier comment by Shawn) that it is worthwhile to think
   about how all of this might apply in a business environment, since
   business leaders - like parents - are always leading by example,
   whether consciously or unconsciously.
   I'm not sure how the "caring" vs. "achievement" balance can best be
   achieved in a business environment ... but I care.﻿

   You know, I respect this article too. But seriously, is this a
   significant national parenting issue? When I think that one in three
   children in so many counties are regularly hungry, I cannot help but
   think of this as a kind of concern-trolling.

   I don't know why so much business theory is about opposition and
   virtually nothing about cooperation. A business, by definition, is
   cooperation. Why is it "caring vs. achievement" and not "caring and
   achievement"?﻿

   Great article - I love seeing evidence for these ideas: 1) character
   building praise ("you're a good helper") trumps behavioral praise
   ("that was good helping"), for 8 and under, and for positive events.
   2) adult actions speak louder than words, to children.﻿

   No, no step 1 is to actually teach biblical teachings. Getting the

   religions that are supposed to promote community, love, peace and
   fellowship to get their heads out of their asses is another story all

   along with all life spontaneously. Then there was a great flood and
   Noah saved 2 of each....let's just leave out the parts in the bible
   about rape, genocide, slavery, murder, and sexism. Throw away evolution
   and general science. Embrace creationism?
   I'd rather not cherry pick a fairytale written by bronze age morality.
   Raising a child to believe in hell as a real place to go after death is
   child abuse. Apologies if this is too far off topic.﻿

   As I said that is the right wing extremist point of view... if you read
   my whole post you would have seen that I'm not that ignorant. but I
   won't respond anymore because talks like this get no where. Atheism is
   a religion as well so my statement of religious extremists goes towards
   atheists as well.
   Extremists are the full embrace of the theory of ignorance that only
   they know what's right when none of us truly know.﻿

   Atheist is a dumb word. We don't need a word for someone who does not
   believe in supernatural entities.
   They however do not claim to know things that haven't yet been solved.
   Pick a religion. They have all the big questions answered. You would
   think they have some explaining to do.
   Ignorant and atheist in the same sentence is dangerous when it comes
   from someone of faith. Believing in something on bad or no evidence is
   the backbone of Abrahamic religions.
   I will bow out of this with you as well. Apparently talking about it is
   pointless?﻿
   One more thing. How do you choose which stories are real and which are
   not? Who gets to decide what parts of the bible are historic and what
   is metaphor? I also like how the semi intelligent religious are
   embracing evolution and saying yes its true and it was all apart of
   gods plan. Playing tennis without the net or god of the gaps. Either
   way god is fading more and more with each scientific advancement. ﻿

   I'm a man of faith that also has an understanding of science. The bang
   happened, I also believe in evolution I just believe that when God said
   let there be light, bang happened. You are a learned man I take, and I
   respect your faith as well. But you will not sway me and I doubt that I
   would sway you.
   All I ask is that you don't put me int he same box as Westboro, the KKK
   or other idiots that shame the God that I love so dear.﻿

   +Joseph Craig lol fair enough. I don't see how you can keep reconciling
   science and religion as they do not mix. I think you may be the type to
   say for instance, we find intelligent alien life and not just one
   species but uncountable numbers. You would say...your biblical god
   created the universe so that includes aliens too.
   I don't think that the goal of talking about it is to change ones
   beliefs. ﻿Looks like you have a new fan in Patrick ﻿

   +Kirk Eichler apparently religiousness (or perhaps belief in God in
   general) can mix with science. One of well known scientists in my
   country (Czechia) is believer. He is a bit like Carl Sagan was in
   western world (big popularizer of astronomy).
   One can see science and trust it, and yet believe that there is an
   almighty being that started it all. For all I know there actually may
   be. But I doubt that if there is, that much of organized religion is
   close to it.﻿

   I think a key piece of this is the recognition that there are
   techniques which are appropriate at different developmental stages.
   I'm sensitive on the guilt/shame piece. I prefer a sense of remorse for
   poor behavior. I want my children to have empathy! Too many Catholics
   (recovering and otherwise) have struggled with guilt. It rarely leads
   to healthy behavior in my experience.﻿

   Good summary, Tim. It is striking that such subtle differences,
   behavior v character, guilt v shame, make such a big change in younger
   kids.
   To me, though, the most important take-away  is that regardless of
   religious teachings or moralizing children model the ACTIONS of
   parents, not what they preach.
   I believe that this is true re: the first two points as well - if the
   parents praise good behavior, but separately instill good character,
   kids turn out fine.
   Honestly, I've seen kids who had bumpy childhoods turn out wonderfully
   and vice versa. While it's worth the effort,  you never know.﻿

   Thanks for sharing +Tim O'Reilly The difference bw guilt and shame got
   me thinking...I always thought shame came out of an external judgement,
   you feel ashamed because you know you're going to be judged, because
   there's a 'the other' ready to judge you...just like when you trip over
   in the street you feel embarrassment just because someone is looking.
   The difference relies on where the moral code is. If we do something
   against our moral code we feel guilty and if we do something against
   someone else's moral code, we feel shame. That's why if I were to be a
   mother, I would care about my children building their own moral code,
   according to well-intentioned values...but not imposing MY moral code,
   because then I'm feeding shame and not guilt...
   What do you think?
   Also guilt implies responsibility, I'm not sure shame does too. Shame
   also causes disappointment. I've known people who hurt other people and
   they feel shameful but they keep on doing all over again. Shame doesn't
   stop you, shame can even trigger again same behavior that caused shame,
   a vicious circle (think of addicts). Guilt is just different.
   Some time in my life I would think guilt is a Judeo-Christian trick
   that's rooted deep within Western culture, but it seems we're born with
   it?﻿
