   Quirky's New A/C Unit Smartens Up Your Dumbest Energy Hog

   This is Aros, a Wi-Fi connected air conditioner aimed at
   energy-conscious consumers that Quirky and GE are launching today. It's
   by far the biggest and most complicated product that Quirky has ever
   built, and it aims to help solve truly endemic problem: The window a/c
   unit, which has remained pretty much unchanged since the 1970s.

   It's been over six months since Quirky and GE announced a partnership,
   wedding one of the youngest and one of the oldest producers of consumer
   technology. Though they've released a menagerie of "connected" gadgets
   in the time since, Aros feels like the team's first earnest product. As
   Quirky CEO Ben Kaufman told me, it's been in the works since the
   partnership was announced. "We want Quirky to be a company that makes
   invention accessible, not just cool kitchen gadgets and fun toys," he
   says. "And GE gives us the ability to take on these really complex
   inventions."

   Like all of Quirky's products, Aros was the idea of a community member:
   Dr. Garthen Leslie, a former Department of Energy employee based in
   Maryland who uploaded the idea to Quirky's forums after contemplating
   a/c units hanging off the sides of buildings on a hot summer day. "I
   was tired of choosing between wasting energy or suffering through the
   stuffy summer heat," he explains.

   By Thanksgiving of last year, the team at GE—which has built window air
   conditioners for 70 years—were hard at work on the concept. For them,
   the project was on a nearly unthinkably short schedule. "I thought
   these guys were crazy," laughs GE Appliances' Kevin Nolan. But, he
   adds, GE is getting something out of the deal, too: "We as a company
   are learning a lot about how we can be bolder and take more risks."
   Normally, an a/c unit like Aros would take about a year to design.
   Today, less than six months later, Leslie's idea is a gleaming reality.

   For a product that claims to reinvent a category, Aros has a low price
   point—$300—which is roughly on par with similar products. That's
   because it didn't require the reinvention of the air conditioner.
   Instead, GE and Quirky have built a conventional in-window a/c that can
   cool up to 350 square feet with 8,000 BTU. They've added some nice
   detailing, too, like upward airflow, three cooling and fan modes,
   insulating fabric panels, and a sleek front-facing paneling.

   What makes it smart is the software, which is linked to Quirky's smart
   home app, Wink. With it, Aros is tethered to your Wi-Fi, and you can
   use your phone like a remote. Turn it on when you're about to get home,
   or make sure it's off when you leave. It will learn when you're home,
   when you use it, and build you a schedule—a bit like Nest's thermostat,
   for those without central air.

   Aros is definitely built for the money-minded user, too. One in-app
   feature will let you set a budget for your monthly energy bill. When
   you get close to your limit, Aros will let you know, avoiding a nasty
   end-of-month surprise on your bill.

   This kind of functionality isn't particularly new for other appliances.
   After all, we can do the same with Quirky's line of smart gadgets, from
   the egg saver to the power strip. But neither of those products
   responded to true problems. In fact, they feel like practice runs in
   the Quirky/GE partnership, a novel way for the companies to beta test
   Wink and iron out any wrinkles the supply chain.

   The energy-hogging, dumb-as-a-brick, ultra-ubiquitous in-window a/c
   unit? That's a problem—the sort that Quirky and GE seem uniquely
   qualified to solve by adding smart software flourishes to existing
   appliance. According to Kaufman, it's a taste of things to come.
   "You're going to see less gadgets and doo-dads and more sophisticated
   products that are completely rethought categories," he adds.

   Until we have a chance to try one, it's impossible to tell just how
   much of a difference Aros will make on your energy bill, but let's hope
   it delivers on its promises—and that the next problem GE and Quirky
   take on is as relevant. You can pre-order Aros on Amazon starting today
   for $300.
