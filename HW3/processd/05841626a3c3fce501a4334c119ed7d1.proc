Obama Outperforms Reagan On Jobs, Growth And Investing

   Comment Now
   Follow Comments Following Comments Unfollow Comments

   The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) today issued America’s latest jobs
   report covering August.  And it’s a disappointment.  The economy
   created an additional 142,000 jobs last month. After six consecutive
   months over 200,000, most pundits expected the string to continue,
   including ADP which just yesterday said 204,000 jobs were created in
   August.

   One month variation does not change a trend

   Even though the plus-200,000 monthly string was broken (unless revised
   upward at a future date,) unemployment did continue to decline and is
   now reported at only 6.1%.  Jobless claims were just over 300,000;
   lowest since 2007.  Despite the lower than expected August jobs number,
   America will create about 2.5 million new jobs in 2014.

   And that is great news.

   Back in May, 2013 (15 months ago) the Dow was out of its recession
   doldrums and hitting new highs. I asked readers if Obama could,
   economically, be the best modern President?  Through discussion of that
   question, the number one issue raised by readers was whether the stock
   market was a good economic barometer for judging “best.”  Many
   complained that the measure they were watching was jobs – and that too
   many people were still looking for work.

   To put this week’s jobs report in economic perspective I reached out to
   Bob Deitrick, CEO of Polaris Financial Partners and author of Bulls,
   Bears and the Ballot Box (which I profiled in October, 2012 just before
   the election) for some explanation.  Since then Polaris’ investor
   newsletters have consistently been the best predictor of economic
   performance. Better than all the major investment houses.

   This is the best private sector jobs creation performance in American
   history

   Unemployment Reagan v Obama

   Bob Deitrick: ”President Reagan has long been considered the best
   modern economic President.  So we compared his performance dealing with
   the oil-induced recession of the 1980s with that of President Obama and
   his performance during this ‘Great Recession.’

   “As this unemployment chart shows, President Obama’s job creation kept
   unemployment from peaking at as high a level as President Reagan, and
   promoted people into the workforce faster than President Reagan.

   “President Obama has achieved a 6.1% unemployment rate in his sixth
   year, fully one year faster than President Reagan did.  At this point
   in his presidency, President Reagan was still struggling with 7.1%
   unemployment, and he did not reach into the mid-low 6% range for
   another full year.  So, despite today’s number, the Obama
   administration has still done considerably better at job creating and
   reducing unemployment than did the Reagan administration.

   “We forecast unemployment will fall to around 5.4% by summer, 2015.  A
   rate President Reagan was unable to achieve during his two terms.”

   What about the Labor Participation Rate?

   Much has been made about the poor results of the labor participation
   rate, which has shown more stubborn recalcitrance as this rate remains
   higher even as jobs have grown.

   U3 v U6 1994-2014 Deitrick: “The labor participation rate adds in
   jobless part time workers and those in marginal work situations with
   those seeking full time work.  This is not a “hidden” unemployment.  It
   is a measure tracked since 1900 and called ‘U6.’ today by the BLS.

   “As this chart shows, the difference between reported unemployment and
   all unemployment – including those on the fringe of the workforce – has
   remained pretty constant since 1994.
   Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics - Databases, Tables and Calculators
   by Subject

   Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics – Databases, Tables and Calculators
   by Subject

   “Labor participation is affected much less by short-term job creation,
   and much more by long-term demographic trends. As this chart from the
   BLS shows, as the Baby Boomers entered the workforce and societal
   acceptance of women working changed, labor participation grew.

   “Now that ‘Boomers’ are retiring we are seeing the percentage of those
   seeking employment decline.  This has nothing to do with job
   availability, and everything to do with a highly predictable aging
   demographic.

   “What’s now clear is that the Obama administration policies have
   outperformed the Reagan administration policies for job creation and
   unemployment reduction.  Even though Reagan had the benefit of a
   growing Boomer class to ignite economic growth, while Obama has been
   forced to deal with a retiring workforce developing special needs.
   During the eight years preceding Obama there was a net reduction in
   jobs in America.  We now are rapidly moving toward higher, sustainable
   jobs growth.”

   Economic growth, including manufacturing, is driving jobs

   When President Obama took office America was gripped in an offshoring
   boom, started years earlier, pushing jobs to the developing world.
   Manufacturing was declining in America, and plants were closing across
   the nation.

   This week the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) released its
   manufacturing report, and it surprised nearly everyone.  The latest
   Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) scored 59, two points higher than July
   and about that much higher than prognosticators expected.  This
   represents 63 straight months of economic expansion, and 25 consecutive
   months of manufacturing expansion.

   New orders were up 3.3 points to 66.7, with 15 consecutive months of
   improvement and reaching the highest level since April, 2004 – five
   years prior to Obama becoming President.  Not surprisingly, this
   economic growth provided for 14 consecutive months of improvement in
   the employment index.  Meaning that the “grass roots” economy made its
   turn for the better just as the DJIA was reaching those highs back in
   2013 – demonstrating that index is still the leading indicator for jobs
   that it has famously always been.

   As the last 15 months have proven, jobs and economy are improving, and
   investors are benefiting

   The stock market has converted the long-term growth in jobs and GDP
   into additional gains for investors.  Recently the S&P has crested
   2,000 – reaching new all time highs.  Gains made by investors earlier
   in the Obama administration have further grown, helping businesses
   raise capital and improving the nest eggs of almost all Americans.  And
   laying the foundation for recent, and prolonged job growth.

   Investment Returns Reagan v Obama Deitrick: ”While most Americans think
   they are not involved with the stock market, truthfully they are.  Via
   their 401K, pension plan and employer savings accounts 2/3 of Americans
   have a clear vested interest in stock performance.

   “As this chart shows, over the first 67 months of their presidencies
   there is a clear “winner” from an investor’s viewpoint. A dollar
   invested when Reagan assumed the presidency would have yielded a
   staggering 190% return.  Such returns were unheard of prior to his
   leadership.

   “However, it is undeniable that President Obama has surpassed the
   previous president.  Investors have gained a remarkable 220% over the
   last 5.5 years!  This level of investor growth is unprecedented by any
   administration, and has proven quite beneficial for everyone.

   “In 2009, with pension funds underfunded and most private retirement
   accounts savaged by the financial meltdown and Wall Street losses,
   Boomers and Seniors were resigned to never retiring.  The nest egg
   appeared gone, leaving the ‘chickens’ to keep working.  But now that
   the coffers have been reloaded increasingly people age 55 – 70 are
   happily discovering they can quit their old jobs and spend time with
   family, relax, enjoy hobbies or start new at-home businesses from their
   laptops or tablets.  It is due to a skyrocketing stock market that
   people can now pursue these dreams and reduce the labor participation
   rates for ‘better pastures.”

   Where myth meets reality
   There is another election in just eight weeks.  Statistics will be
   bandied about.  Monthly data points will be hotly contested.  There
   will be a lot of rhetoric by candidates on all sides.  But,
   understanding the prevailing trends is critical.  Recognizing that
   first the economy, then the stock market and now jobs are all trending
   upward is important – even as all 3 measures will have short-term
   disappointments.

   There are a lot of reasons voters elect a candidate.  Jobs and the
   economy are just one category of factors.  But, for those who place a
   high priority on jobs, economic performance and the markets the data
   clearly demonstrates which presidential administration has performed
   best.  And shows a very clear trend one can expect to continue into
   2015.

   Economically, President Obama’s administration has outperformed
   President Reagan’s in all commonly watched categories.  Simultaneously
   the current administration has reduced the deficit, which skyrocketed
   under Reagan.  Additionally, Obama has reduced federal employment,
   which grew under Reagan (especially when including military personnel,)
   and truly delivered a “smaller government.”  Additionally, the current
   administration has kept inflation low, even during extreme
   international upheaval, failure of foreign economies (Greece) and a
   dramatic slowdown in the European economy.

       This is a joke right? The majority of July output was orders for
       aircraft. On last check Boeing had 8 to 10 Dream Liners sitting in
       Seattle the cannot sell and are already becoming outdated. The 200
       M plus list has been reduced to sub 100M and they still sit. The
       hefty discount on all new Dream Liners is approaching 50%.
       Deitrick must be readying for a diplomatic post with this
       administration to be able to say that inflation is low, (by whose
       metric?), employment up, and Obama has reduced the deficit.

       No, Timothy, it is not a joke at all. And I am not readying myself
       to be on a diplomatic mission for the POTUS… I am perfectly content
       doing what I do for a living with my clients. Inflation is lower.
       Gas prices are lower compared to 2008. That is true as well. The
       Stock Market has reached all time highs under this President
       compared with two insane market crashes by his predecessor. And
       Obama has reduced the deficit whereas President Reagan tripled the
       National Debt in his eight years in office.
       If there is anything else you’d like to chat about Tim, please let
       me know. Thanks for your comment.

       lmao, you lost me when you said Obama reduced the deficit. It’s
       only because the House GOP wouldn’t allow him to spend the money he
       wanted that the deficit has been reduced.
       Then, you state that unemployment and blah, blah blah. The REAL
       unemployment numbers say otherwise. Nice propaganda piece. The
       reality of the situation, which you seem to be insulated from, is
       this: prices have continued to increase and wages have been
       stagnant for the last 5 years. There are screams of entitlement
       from the unskilled and unemployed. There is the highest welfare
       participation in the US ever in history and the ACA has increased
       the size of the Gov’t. Only thing is his reduction in the military
       – which Clinton did as well to say he had a smaller Gov’t. Look
       where that got us. An attack on the USS Cole and then 9/11.

       Well Chad, I am glad you got a good laugh today. Why don’t your
       chuckle on a few more facts then as well. The House did in fact
       permit Reagan to deficit spend and those borrowed funds are what
       got us out of the recession of 1982 and that started us on one of
       the greatest growth curves this country has ever seen between the
       summer of 1982 and the October of 1987… Yes, and that was with
       borrowed money.
       As for your other argument which is full of buffalo bagels. When
       our Marine base in Beirut was attacked in 1983, and 300 men were
       lost – 220 of our own Marines and 18 sailors along with 50 french
       soldiers, what did Ronald Reagan do then? Do you remember? Of
       course not. That is because he left. Yes, Reagan cut and run and
       said we are getting the hell out of here. This all happened as we
       were building up our military during the Reagan years. How could
       that be you ask? Well, sometimes crazy sh** beyond a Presidents
       control does happens. That compares to Clinton losing 17 sailors
       during the USS Cole Bombing. Both were catastrophic. Which was
       worse Chad? Why dont you consider what happend during Reagan’s
       administration as well to our marines there? And guess what Reagan
       did, he did nothing. He just got us the hell out a there… Keep that
       in mind Chad when you start your next LMAO.

       Wha??!! Let’s get real … Employment statistics have been under
       heavy manipulation is recent years, actual unemployment (including
       underemployment) is still pushing 12+ percent. The stock markets
       are up only because they are being buoyed by the continuous
       printing of excess money by the Fed!! Private-sector GDP growth
       under Obama is far below that achieved by Reagan. What we have here
       is selective interpretation of data.

       Actually, Tom, your assessment is not quite accurate… Unemployment
       is at 6.1%. The U6 rate is higher as it was under Reagan as well.
       The U6 unemployment rate under Reagan was almost 20% in fact in
       1984!
       The stock market has performed well because companies are
       performing well in the United States. You can give the Fed credit
       if you want, but in my view, that is inaccurate and the Market has
       done well despite what the Fed has done or tried to do. All the Fed
       did was to keep us from falling through the floor as we almost did
       in 2008 and 2009… Private Sector GDP is not doing poorly today
       either, and in fact, it is improving as well. Thanks for your
       comment.

       As you are speaking about things you know nothing about, I’ll
       educate you. Under GHW, when we pulled into what was considered a
       semi-hostile port, such as Yeman, we did so under full armament.
       Yes, that meant side guns were mounted a manned. Watch standers on
       the quarterdeck were all armed, and had USMC accompaniment at all
       times. Clinton came in, started cutting the military back and in
       order to make us seem less weak, decided that a “kinder and
       gentler” military was in order. No more manned guns. Only 1 armed
       person on the quarterdeck. A single roving watch that was
       responsible to roam the entire ship rather than the entire ship
       being watched at all times, along with surrounding waters. There
       simply wasn’t the manpower to do so. We went from a fully manned,
       fully ready military, to 80% manning.
       Now, since you want to take into account Beirut – it’s a lot easier
       to bomb a building than it is to attack a ship at anchor under full
       watch. The fact is simple – cutting back the military caused the
       attack on the USS Cole to be successful.

       I think the only way to get an accurate assessement of what you
       just said would be to ask the Captain in Command of the USS Cole. I
       will listen to his testimony on this issue. As for dealing with
       these suicide bombers, well perhaps, if we had taken the concerns
       that our Counter-terrorism expert had in the White House, Richard
       Clark, during August of 2001, perhaps we could have avoided 911 as
       well, but now we will never know…
       And you missed my point, the facts are that lousy things happen
       during periods of war that are inexplicable or that are difficult
       to explain, because it is war… Perhaps we should stay out of the
       Middle East and let them deal with their own issues. That is
       debatable. Thanks for your comment. Let’s see what the Commander of
       the USS Cole says.

       Turn off Fox fool. The welfare rolls in OHIO are record lows.
       Welfare, I mean cash assistance. Food stamps are high because of
       the millions of Americans working for slave wages because of the
       Republicans loving low wages. You either pay a living wage like
       they did back in the day. or pay with food stamps. it is what it
       is. Wages are record lows for the last 40 years

       Celia: I would say, “you go girl” and I would mean it… And I dont
       care what race you are, I love your passion!
       But the reality is, you are quite correct – here in Ohio, that is
       accurate. The Welfare rolls are down due to budget constraints at
       the state and Fed Level, but some firms like Walmart actually teach
       their own Ee’s how to get food stamps and other financial
       assistance since they pay such a poor wage. Fairly ironic isnt it?
       One of the largest and most profitable firms in the entire world
       and yet, they can’t afford to pay their own people a wage which
       they can live on…

       Very true. They blew that election prediction – didn’t they. Even

       day. And it cost Dick Morris his job at Fox as well…

       Chad you are woefully misinformed. Welfare (cash payments)is at 4%
       nation-wide and it is TEMPORARY. There are school/work
       requirements. Here is how the right-wing tallies the so-called
       “welfare stats” : 74% of Welfare payment go to CHILDREN. So I guess
       those little ragamuffins need to pull themselves up by their
       Huggies and get to work! In addition the right ADDS ON SOCIAL
       SECURITY (How dare Grandma steal from the government!) Disability
       payments (the majority of people PAID into that while working and
       it is difficult to get which is why there are so many lawyers on
       TV.) Medicare, Medicaid, foodstamps (SNAP), school lunches,
       unemployment insurance and rental and utiity assistance
       What is missing from their analysis is that most of these actually
       ARE WORKING (except for the “GREEDY” KIDS let’s get rid of that
       pesky child labor law!) Oh yes and many seniors and the disabled
       are working part-time to supplement their income.
       You are crazy if you think any of these programs make people rich.
       It is subsistence living. Being disabled I get $1000 a month and
       almost half of that goes towards rent.
       The problem is not the economy. If it were then WHY do we have
       ONE-THIRD MORE millionaires and billionaires in this country than
       we did BEFORE the recession! The problem is that they refuse to pay
       good wages and ship our higher paying jobs overseas, along with
       their profits so that they do not have to pay hardly anything in
       taxes
       States that have RAISED the minimum wage are experiencing A BOOM IN
       EMPLOYMENT.
       I am going to make another post where I will post the numbers. Of
       course the problem with FOX viewers (who are the least informed
       people in the nation) is that no matter what anyone says you will
       not let go of your precious beliefs (scapegoating) that the poor
       are to blame for everything that is wrong in this country instead
       of seeing them as a symptom of what is wrong with the 1% scrooges
       who really don’t give a damn about anyone, including you, if you
       are not rich yourself.
