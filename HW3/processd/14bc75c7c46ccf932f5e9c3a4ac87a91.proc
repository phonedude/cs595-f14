Why Do Other Rich Nations Spend So Much Less on Healthcare?

   The U.S. delivers roughly three times as many mammograms,
   two-and-a-half times as many MRI scans, and a third more C-sections per
   capita than the average OECD country.

   Jim Bourg/Reuters

   Despite the news last week that America's healthcare spending will not
   be rising at the sky-high rate that was once predicted, the fact
   remains that the U.S. far outspends its peer nations when it comes to
   healthcare costs per capita. This year the United States will spend
   almost 18 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) on healthcare—six
   percentage points more than the Netherlands, the next highest spender.
   Because the U.S. GDP in 2014 will be approximately 17 trillion dollars,
   those six percentage points over the Netherlands amount to one trillion
   dollars in additional spending. The burden to the average household
   through lost wages, insurance premiums, taxes, out-of-pocket care, and
   other costs will be more than $8,000.

   Why does the United States spend so much more? The biggest reason is
   that U.S. healthcare delivers a more expensive mix of services. For
   example, a much larger proportion of physician visits in the U.S. are
   to specialists who get higher fees and usually order more high-tech
   diagnostic and therapeutic procedures than primary care physicians.

   Compared with the average OECD country, the U.S. delivers (population
   adjusted) almost three times as many mammograms, two-and-a-half times
   the number of MRI scans, and 31 percent more C-sections. Also, the U.S.
   has more stand-by equipment, for example, 1.66 MRI machines per 6,000
   annual scans vs. 1.06 machines. The extra machines provide easier
   access for Americans, but add to cost. Similarly, occupancy rates in
   U.S. acute care hospitals are much lower than in OECD countries,
   reducing the likelihood of delays in admissions, but building that
   extra capacity adds to cost. Aggressive treatment of very sick elderly
   also makes the mix expensive. In the U.S. many elderly patients are
   treated in intensive care units (ICUs), but in other countries they
   would receive only palliative care. More amenities such as privacy and
   space in hospitals and more attractive clinics also add to U.S. costs.

   While the U.S. mix of services is disproportionately tilted toward more
   expensive interventions, the other OECD countries emphasize a “plain
   vanilla” mix. Compared with the U.S., the average OECD country has 30
   percent more physician visits and more than 30 percent more hospital
   days per capita.
   The complexity of private-sector insurance is not in the public
   interest. Each company offers many plans that differ in coverage,
   deductibles, co-pays, premiums, and other features that make it
   difficult for buyers to compare the prices of different policies.

   One reason for the more expensive mix in the U.S. is it produces more
   income for drug manufacturers, specialist physicians, and others who
   have considerable influence on policy. Second, some patients prefer the
   more expensive mix, just as some prefer to shop at Whole Foods rather
   than Walmart. Third, some workers mistakenly believe that employers pay
   for their healthcare and that more expensive means better care. Health
   economists believe that the premiums for employer-sponsored insurance
   come out of potential wages. Similarly, the extra money the government
   spends for health could be used for education, infrastructure, the
   environment, and other public investment, but these alternatives are
   not readily apparent or agreed upon. Does the more expensive mix result
   in better health outcomes? There are no definitive studies to answer
   this question. Superficially, it appears that the systems in the other
   countries are more effective because their life expectancy is higher.
   But their advantage may be attributable to non-medical factors such as
   significantly lower poverty rates.

   A second important reason for higher healthcare spending in the U.S. is
   higher prices for inputs such as drugs and the services of specialist
   physicians. The prices of branded prescription drugs in the U.S. are,
   on average, about double those in other countries. The fees of
   specialist physicians are typically two to three times as high as in
   other countries. The lower prices and fees abroad are achieved by
   negotiation and controls by governments who typically pay for about 75
   percent of all medical care. Government in the U.S. pays about 50
   percent, which would still confer considerable bargaining power, but
   the government is kept from exerting it by legislation and a Congress
   sensitive to interest-group lobbying.

   The third and last important reason for higher spending in the U.S. is
   high administrative costs of insurance. This includes private insurance
   which covers more than half the insured population. Each year scores of
   insurance companies must estimate appropriate premiums for plans they
   wish to sell to several million employers plus 20 to 30 million
   individuals. In addition, hospitals, clinics, and individual physicians
   incur substantial costs in billing for each test, visit, and procedure
   regardless of whether they are covered by private or public insurance
   or self-pay. Many of our peer countries have lower administrative costs
   through more coordination, standardization, and in some countries a
   single national system or several regional healthcare-insurance
   systems, even when the provision of care is primarily a private-sector
   responsibility.
