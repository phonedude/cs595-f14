   Day After Massacre in His Former District, Tony Strickland Makes a
   Chilling Pro-Gun Call to Voters
   By Mike Devlin
   Tony Strickland outside of his office in Santa Barbara in 2009 (SB
   Independent/Paul Wellman)
   Here is a recording of a robocall received today by a voter in the 25th
   Congressional district, touting Tony Strickland's pro-gun stances,
   voting record, and support from organizations like the NRA.

   s/151163701&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_artwor
   k=true

   The timing could hardly be more tasteless. Just yesterday, a UCSB
   student shot over a dozen people and killed six (three by stabbing) –
   most of them fellow students. Tony Strickland actually represented
   Santa Barbara and Isla Vista in the State Senate until late 2012, and
   many of these victims were likely former constituents of Strickland's.
   For a sobering perspective on yesterday's tragedy, here is a statement
   by Richard Martinez, whose son Christopher was killed yesterday:

   ** Update: some readers have reported that the Soundcloud player isn't
   working on mobile devices. Here is a link to the page itself, which
   might work for some. Alternately, I've transcribed the call here:

   Protect our gun rights, vote for Tony Strickland for Congress. Tony
   Strickland has a history of protecting our 2nd Amendment rights and
   will do the same in Congress, Tony Strickland was a founding member of
   the NRA Member Council and former California Rifle and Pistol
   Association Legislator of the Year.

   Tony has been a longtime supporter of the rights of citizens to keep
   and bear arms and will continue to oppose, and actively fight, any
   legislation that would take away our 2nd Amendment right to bear arms.
   As the founder of the Freedom Firearms Coalition and with a lifetime
   'A' rating from the NRA, we can count on Tony Strickland to protect our
   constitutional rights.

   On June 3rd, vote for Tony Strickland for Congress. This call was paid
   for by Strickland for Congress.

      The only thing chilling about this is the degree to which a partisan
      clown is willing to be partisan clown and use tragedy and grief for
      partisan gain.
      The conservative equivalent of this would be to use all the Drug War
      related deaths that have happened and refer to liberal candidate's
      rally to a pro legalization base as 'chilling' - as if - as if being
      against the Drug War somehow meant that you were 'totally okay' with
      thousands of murders and kidnappings. Like Bestiat said, it's as if we
      were to be accused of not wanting people to eat, b/c we don't want the
      state to raise grain." It really is pathetic.
      We need to protect ALL rights, across the board, and not use the club
      of state violence to control other people. We need to protect our gun
      rights and our rights to ingest what we want. And enough with this mind
      numbing partisan dogma, it won't be soon enough if it ever ends.

      Don't worry if it does happen to your kid if you have one or a very
      close family member you will have a good wisdom to respond to a tragedy
      like this and all your right. Lets keep our fingers cross for that day.

      An unthinking response that explains absolutely nothing and doesn't
      overthrow any of the valid points I brought up into this discussion.
      Shame on your sorry self for using a tragedy to make a political point.

      No, the equivalent would be a call for pro-legalization a day after a
      house with 12 people who overdosed on heroin was discovered. The fact
      you cannot recognize the distinction in your example should make you
      pause the next time you decide to write something on the Internet.

      That's the same thing. Someone dies b/c the item in question was part
      of a supported ban or prohibitive law. You don't blame the right to use
      or do these things just b/c someone is crazy and abuses it.

      Are you aware Windy, that the absence of gun control laws and the
      absence of drug control laws are both traditional LIBERTARIAN
      traditions. Drug control laws arise out of the Progressive tradition of
      government regulations making life better and more safe for its
      citizens. The Prohibition of alcohol in the early 20th century, for
      example, was a Progressive or Liberal action.
      What's got you confused, Windy, is that liberals don't think society
      should be making that same alcohol-Prohibition mistake again with
      respect to marijuana. That doesn't apply to other drugs. Anything goes
      with drugs is like with guns, a LIBERTARIAN position, not a Liberal
      one.
      Let's keep things straight.

      I am aware my friend, I was only citing what also happens to be the
      conservative and liberal positions cross gun control and drug
      legalization as examples. It's the best way to talk to people that are
      brainwashed by false left and right politics. I am 100% libertarian
      like you, and I too know that liberals support the right to your body
      only superficially and not philosophically; if they did, they'd be
      libertarians b/c to understand your beliefs philosophically would mean
      to discard the contradictions which would lead to supporting rights in
      totality.

      Strickland, like so many of his his supporters, seems to suffer from
      "Aggrieved White Male Syndrome:" Poor pitiful me, I want what I want
      when I want it and I want it now and if I can't get it, it's everyone
      else's fault and I therefore have a right to act out my frustrated
      sense of entitlement on others. The tragedy comes when some people,
      like the kid in SB, take that thinking to its logical limit - not only
      blame others for their lack of self-worth, but literally kill them.

      The lack of intelligence so far in this discussion is nauseating. Does
      any gun control advocate have anything to say besides adjectives and
      insults?
      Look at yourselves, climbing over the dead bodies to stage a political
      agenda. Appalling.

      It is sad that the victims father chose to bring up the NRA as the big
      issue in his son's death. He gets a huge pass on that issue due to his
      understandable grief. Strickland's campaign was just boneheaded. Not
      likely the intent was to exploit the issue.
      I already have an idea to the answers to these questions but these must
      be asked and answered to get a true understanding:
      The first three were murdered with a knife. If the murderer had no gun
      would he not have killed the rest by knife?
      What kind of religious/moral teaching did the murderer get in his life?
      What was his father's role in his moral upbringing?
      His father stated that he is anti gun. Was this stance shared with his
      son? If so why did it not prevent the shooting?
      I think of the Boy Scout program where boys are taught to grow up to be
      moral men. They are also taught how to safely use guns. Someone will
      probably find a rare exception, but how many of these youth mass
      murderers had a Boy Scout or similar upbringing?
      Let's get to the real root of the problem. Not just a knee jerk
      reaction toward the NRA.

      How about a REAL apology from Strickland personally, for having had the
      insensitivity to let the robo-calls run after the tragedy. And then
      after all the public disgust, he STILL hasn't suspended the calls for a
      period of mourning. There's just no excuse for either of these
      failures.

      There is no disgust, just partisan politics. A person being killed by
      drugs doesn't mean you stop promoting the right to ingest what you want
      into your body.

      You nailed it! I am an Eagle Scout and was taught at an early age how
      to responsibly handle firearms.
      Now in my 30's I carry everyday and hope to God I never have to use my
      weapon but am trained and prepared to do so. Our right to keep and bear
      arms is paramount and those that want to take it away project their
      insecurities about guns on others.
      It's very sad what happened in Isla Vista but had that been a local
      market I was at I'm prepared to fight back to try and save the lives of
      myself and others. Society is safer with people like me.
      You pass by me in the grocery store and don't know I have a tool on my
      person that could protect you from evil such as this.
      Godspeed,
      Responsible Citizen

      Two of mass shootings that occurred during the past 3 years occurred in
      facilities filled with men carrying firearms. It didn't stop them and
      never has. Firearms in the home kill family members more than 90% of
      the time. Other than that, almost always visiting friends. Intruders?
      Less than 1%.
      You gun-carry people have some sad impotent need to walk around with an
      erect tool ready to shoot off. Maybe you should get some Viagra to help
      you with your problem.

      Stepehen,
      I don't have a problem. What I have is a love for human life unlike
      these monsters.
      Who do we call when trouble occurs? We call the police - because they
      have guns. I know it's a crazy concept but think about that for a
      moment.
      When seconds count it's better to have a good guy with a gun then wait
      for the police to show up.
      Saying I am already carrying an "erect tool" is ignorant.
      Again I carry because I cherish human life and love others - even anti
      gunners as yourself.
      I am an adult who spends hundreds of dollars each month practicing and
      taking classes where I am surrounded by police and responsible
      individuals such as myself. I don't take carrying a gun lightly and
      hope other anti-gunners would give me the same respect they give law
      enforcement.
      You never know, one day one of us responsible individuals may save your
      life or someone you care about.
      Godspeed,
      Responsible Citizen

      Stephen, what's with the penis infatuation?
      Or why is it that if you see no reason to have something that someone
      else has, it becomes an issue of penis envy?
      Because that's all one gets out of your comment.

      Jim Farley:
      A quick Google search comes up with four serial killers that were EAGLE
      Scouts. John Joubert (Google that for some really blood chilling stuff)
      was a Scout leader in Bellevue, Nebraska where he committed the paper
      boy abductions and murders.
      No indictment on the Scouts, since they obviously don't have anything
      in their program that promotes serial killing, but NOTHING is the
      inoculation that will stop these lightning strikes from happening other
      than law enforcement and community vigilance since it is impossible to
      profile the really out there crazies, unless we want to just lock up
      every male between the ages of 18 and 35, which having two of those is
      not without appeal.

      Tim,
      Congratulations, you found the exceptions that I already acknowledged
      would likely exist. I still believe that as a nation we are failing our
      boys. As a rule they are not being brought up to be men with moral
      values like we were. There is more of a sense of entitlement that leads
      to the narcicistic behavior if this A-hole who seeks random revenge
      over his perceived snubs.

      Mike:
      Unlike Jim, I am one baby boomer who doesn't have this false view of
      the utopian nature of the past. (Also I am a lot younger than Jim, or
      at least look a lot younger! :) There were plenty of downright A-holes
      and scary guys at my college with similar profiles to Eliot Rodger who
      miraculously didn't shoot the place up or stab people to death. Maybe
      the only difference now is the existence of the internet where these
      cats can find mutual dark support (i.e. Facebook page stating that
      Rodger was an "American Hero." ) that riles up their problems

      Wow. I have a false view of a utopian past? You arrogantly read a lot
      in to my comments Tim. And then you add an ad hominim attack as well.
      What is the matter? Are you bored down in the OC? Has the OC Register
      not yet given you a column?

      Youth murders down mostly to a decrease in gang related violence. (Did
      not google any stats on that but am confident my statement would be
      confirmed).
      There seems to be a clear uptick in "disconnected white youth" mass
      murder. That I believe is related to our boys, not all but enough, not
      being brought up with a moral foundation.

      Another great catch by SCV's own Mr. Exposé, Mike Devlin.
      Let's hope stricter national gun laws can be passed in honor of the
      victims.

      Not really, this is just partisan quacks using a tragedy for political
      gain. It's really pathetic to see you guys climbing desperately over
      dead bodies to validate your partisan dogma.

      Note that three of the victims were stabbed to death. We should,
      therefore, outlaw knives. He drove a BMW so outlaw those. etc, etc,
      etc....

      On a lighter note, doesn't Tony Strickland look like Lurch from the
      Addams Family?

      Boy Scouts don't kill people; they just discriminate against those
      people who happen to be gay and
      let the pedophiles hold an office for years.
      Frankly, there are ALL races and religions buried in Eternal Valley,
      and I think it is wrong to arbitrarily
      stick a cross into someone's grave without the expressed permission of
      the deceased survivors.
      I did NOT attend this ceremony. I did once and will not return. Instead
      I went to a Church where
      I offered thanks to the Creator for theirs and my Service to our
      Country. From what I experienced
      and have seen posted on the internet, the Eternal Valley event is in
      reality a gathering of Republican Politicians glad-handing each other,
      similar to the mayors prayer breakfast.
      I'm surprised they weren't pounding Strickland Posters into the graves!

      Did somebody mention Boy Scouts as moral leaders? You came out OK
      because you were a Boy Scout and not a serial killer? Good for you!
      Let's leave generalities, Boy Scouts, good fathers, etc. out of this.
      Don't blame his parents. When they became aware of their son's deadly
      plan, the parents alerted the authorities and were rushing to Santa
      Barbara to prevent a tragedy. Their son was mentally ill and he had a
      cache of guns and ammunition. Deal with it .
