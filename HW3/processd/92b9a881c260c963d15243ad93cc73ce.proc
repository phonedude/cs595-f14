Make your best pitch to be on the list.

   This nomination is for Shea Sulkin (she would never nominate herself),
   co-founder and lead designer of Aunt Bertha's software platform. She is
   not only an exceptionally talented designer, product manager and
   entrepreneur but she is someone who is fully committed to the mission
   of making human services information accessible to both people in need
   and the programs that serve them.

Who else thinks you're awesome?

   Aunt Bertha's other co-founder, Erine Gray, has been selected as a 2014
   TED Fellow (not possible had it not been for Shea's contribution to the
   company). Aunt Bertha's lead investor is the Pershing Square
   Foundation, based in New York City (also not possible without Shea's
   design and product management contributions).

Does your company have a social mission? If so, describe it.

   Aunt Bertha is a certified B Corp and our mission is to make human
   services information accessible to both people and programs. Our search
   has helped more than 50,000 people find social service programs in
   their area. In doing so, we've been able to see trends of what people
   are looking for and how. This allows community leaders to gauge the
   economic health of their community in real time.

What are you passionate about other than your business?

   Shea is currently training to be a yoga instructor, and she is
   currently publishing her mother's auto biography (her mom battled
   cancer five times, and beat it four times).
