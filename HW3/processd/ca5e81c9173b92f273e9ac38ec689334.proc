Malignant computation

To properly serve society, cryptocurrencies must support computer hardware
that is useful for other things.

   Cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin, could revolutionize money to the same
   degree that the Internet has revolutionized communication. However,
   like any economic marketplace, human exuberance is the greatest threat
   to the cryptocurrency phenomenon. Markets fail to the degree that the
   market can be dominated by those seeking personal gain, and markets
   succeed to the degree that they resist domination and focus on
   benefiting society at large.

   The cryptocurrency market place is in danger of becoming so focused on
   profitability, that it loses sight of the potential computational
   benefits that it could provide to society. I hope that this article
   will influence designers of cryptocurrencies to attempt to avoid
   computational malignancy.

   Many people regard the success or failure of the market to be the
   degree that it works for them, rather than for society as a whole. One
   of the fundamental motivations for cryptocurrency is the general sense
   that banks, governments and markets have failed to protect the interest
   of the common man. It is not an accident that the rise of bitcoin began
   shortly after the sub-prime mortgage crisis.

   Cells, typically, prefer to serve the whole organism, but when they get
   confused and start to multiply without regard for the impact on the
   organism as a whole, they can morph into a series of diseases that we
   refer to collectively as cancer. This is why “curing cancer” is so
   hard. Cancer is not a disease, but a family of diseases that share a
   common core problem: cells acting in their own interests that betray
   the body as a collective.

   We have a similar problem with the use of computation in markets. We
   can call this malignant computation. This is when computation starts to
   ensure its own survival at the expense of the overall marketplace. The
   Skynet hypothesis is a boogeyman intended to scare the young and the
   paranoid. The real threat from AI is that it will become so good at the
   pointless tasks that we have given it that those pointless tasks will
   become a black hole of resources.

   This has already happened with high-frequency trading on Wall Street.
   There is an ongoing arms race between computers that trade stocks to
   see which one can get the edge over the other, and entire series of
   engineering feats that have no purpose whatsoever other than to
   overcome previous engineering feats. In several respects, the
   computational trading platforms are the most advanced computation
   systems on the planet, and they are engaged in a micro-second game of
   mutual navel gazing. There is so much money being “made” by these super
   computers that the only thing that is absolutely certain is that
   further funding for bigger super computers will become available.

   Capital markets serve a function in society. They ensure that
   businesses that provide value to society will have access to large
   amounts of capital to invest in otherwise too expensive projects. I
   have not been able to think of a single way in which the high-frequency
   trading platforms have improved the markets capacity to serve that
   function. No one has been able to provide me with any contrary insight,
   although several pointed me to more eloquent statements of the
   underlying problem. High-frequency trading is the first and foremost
   example of malignant computing, but it is not the last.

   Malignant computing is a problem in cryptocurrencies too, but in order
   to discuss it clearly, one has to understand how the computational arms
   race in cryptocurrency mining works. This article does a wonderful job
   of summarizing the issues of the crypto arms race.

   Cryptocurrencies in the bitcoin mold rely on a process called “mining,”
   which is the process of performing arbitrary calculations that help to
   ensure that the currency as a whole is functional and secure. Because
   of the inflated prices of bitcoins, mining has been very profitable,
   and as a result, we have seen the entire computational infrastructure
   of bitcoin switch to ASICS, or Application Specific Integrated
   Circuits. When you see the word ASIC, you should have a mental shortcut
   to “single purpose computing.” The bitcoin mining ASICs are so specific
   that they can only be used for the computations for bitcoin mining;
   they cannot even perform nearly identical computations for different
   parts of the bitcoin computation process.

   I believe that this is another example of malignant computing. Bitcoin
   mining will continue until 2033. For bitcoin, ASICs will do the vast
   majority of this work, and assuming the value of a single bitcoin
   continues to rise, the amount of money invested in specialized hardware
   to perform bitcoin mining will almost certainly pass into the tens of
   billions of dollars. The bitcoin mining algorithms rewards miners
   relative to the whole amount of computational power devoted to bitcoin
   mining everywhere. If computational power were equated to “lottery
   tickets,” this would be tantamount to massive changes to “your chance
   of winning.”

   Permit me to digress with this analogy: Let’s imagine a lottery for
   $100. If you have 10 lottery tickets and there are 100 lottery tickets
   in total, then you have a 1/10 chance of winning. If the lottery
   tickets cost less than $1 and you are ensured that there will be many
   more rounds of the lottery, then it makes sense to purchase tickets in
   every round. Over time, consistent participation will ensure a profit.
   If the lottery ticket costs more than $1, then participating repeatedly
   will guarantee a loss.

   Bitcoin-style mining works in much the same way. With one exception:
   the number of lottery tickets are proportional to the total amount of
   computation devoted to the process. Let’s imagine that there were
   several million lottery tickets available. Owners of ASIC computers
   would be able to acquire hundreds of thousands of tickets each. Owners
   of programable specialized hardware would be able to purchase tens of
   thousands of tickets. Owners of commodity hardware with specific
   graphics cards would be able to buy thousands of tickets. Owners of
   commodity hardware without graphics cards would be able to buy one or
   two tickets.

   Remember that tickets are not free, running computers requires
   electricity, and the electricity bill for running a lot of computers
   can be quite high. In order to profitably participate in cryptocurrency
   mining, you have to at least make more money than your ongoing
   electricity costs and the costs required to obtain your hardware. To
   summarize (data as of the writing):
   Total computation devoted to mining (i.e. total lottery tickets)
   88,502,557,900 MH/s
   Typical ASIC computation 100,000 (2013) 1,000,000 (2014) MH/s
   Typical FPGA computation 1000-25,000 MH/s
   Typical GPU (graphics card) computation 500-2500 MH/s
   Typical CPU computation 10 MH/s

   Currently, it is not practical to mine bitcoin without an ASIC. There
   are so many ASICs that are contributing to the total amount of
   computation devoted to bitcoin mining that nothing else can justify the
   costs of electricity to compete against the ASICs for reasonable shares
   of the mining rewards.

   This is a problem because the ASICs represent a tremendous amount of
   raw computational resources that are permanently devoted to financial
   busy work. The bitcoin mining network would work just as well if it had
   far less computation devoted to it. Bitcoins would be mined at exactly
   the same rate if 1/2 or 1/4 of the computational resources were
   devoted. This means that bitcoin has incentivized a tremendous amount
   of computational busy work. So far, the estimate is that the bitcoin
   has used about 150,000 megawatt hours of electricity, which is about
   1/8^th of what the state of Hawaii uses in one year. It would not be
   unreasonable to assume that at the rate of growth, the bitcoin mining
   network will surpass the yearly electricity usage of a small state
   soon.

   If we include the environmental impact of producing and manufacturing
   hardware specifically for bitcoin mining along with the electricity
   costs, then society has invested in a tremendous amount of unnecessary
   computation. Clearly, this is another example of malignant computation.

   The order of usefulness in bitcoin mining is:

   1. ASIC 2. FPGA 3. GPU 4. CPU

   The order of usefulness for all other computations is exactly the
   opposite:

   1. CPU 2. GPU 3. FPGA 4. ASIC

   ASICs achieve their dominance over the mining network by being utterly
   and totally useless for anything other than bitcoin computation.

   But we must give credit where it is due. It is a feat of engineering
   that bitcoin works at all. It is no trivial thing to engineer a
   cryptocurrency where none existed and ensure that it is both secure and
   adoptable. Bitcoin is a trailblazer, and there was no way to know for
   certain, in advance, that the drive to ASICs would happen.

   Litecoin is another matter. Litecoin bills itself as “silver to
   bitcoin’s gold.” It was designed using mathematics that would resist
   implementation in an ASIC. Litecoin has proven to be the second viable
   cryptocurrency, and it won this position in no small part because it
   advertised itself as CPU-centric and mineable on “consumer” hardware.
   Essentially, litecoin was intended to be a cryptocurrency that would
   not succumb to computational malignancy.

   Litecoin is facing something of a crisis, as the first ASIC to support
   litecoin mining will likely be out soon. Silver is distinct from gold
   because there are notable and substantial differences between the
   metals. Litecoin is about to lose its central distinction from bitcoin.
   All of the other distinctions between litecoin and bitcoin are mostly
   irrelevant, differences of preferences and not of substance. There is a
   poll and discussion on Bitcointalk that shows there is a preference for
   changing the litecoin proof-of-work algorithm to make ASIC mining
   impossible.

   To suggest that this happen with bitcoin would be unthinkable. The
   bitcoin project advertised its method for proof-of-work, and there was
   never an intention to prevent any approach. But litecoin specifically
   had CPU-oriented proof-of-work as a goal. I hope that litecoin decides
   to change its proof-of-work to ensure it does not become a clone of
   bitcoin. If it is to stay distinct, it must do so in the most
   fundamental way and stick to its roots. After all, if I have to buy an
   ASIC, why not just buy one for bitcoin? I hope litecoin gets this one
   right.

   I expect, however, that if litecoin decides not to modify its
   proof-of-work algorithm, it will be supplanted as “silver” by another
   cryptocurrency that does take this commitment seriously. YAcoin has
   committed to intentionally changing its proof-of-work over time to be
   ASIC resistant, but so far I have found no cryptocurrency that has
   committed to actually changing its proof-of-work if the current
   proof-of-work becomes ASIC friendly. So far, at least, no one regards
   this arms race as a central problem that needs both technology and
   cultural solutions. Changing the proof-of-work in a mining community
   would produce a fork unless there was strong consensus around the goal
   of avoiding computation for the sake of itself.

   It order to avoid computational malignancy, a cryptocurrency must
   support miners who have computer hardware that is useful for other
   things. Or it could integrate a fundamentally useful process as its
   proof-of-work (which is the approach that primecoin takes as it
   attempts to find prime numbers).

   Eventually, cryptocurrency mining software should ship with
   implementations of APIs that allow its computational resources to be
   accessed for other purposes. The OpenStack protocols are a good place
   to start for this. In fact, as the OpenStack protocols mature, they
   should support cryptocurrency remittance. That way, a currency miner
   who has invested in a data center can say, “Oh, you will pay me 100
   litecoin/bitcoin/whatever to view my mining cluster as a Hadoop
   instance? I would only make 90 mining! OK, sold; here are your access
   keys.”

   Which is the reason that I have an Ox in this ditch. The “Omics” in
   medical science is going to require super computer resources on a
   massive scale, and while the most profitable health care inquiries will
   always be pursued, there will be more and more of a need for
   computation resources for “orphan” diseases, etc. The capacity to
   repurpose mining networks to perform genomic, proteomic, or exomic
   analysis would ensure that the network would be available to serve
   society, not just itself.

   (I should warn that I am not giving investment advice — or more
   strictly, that if you were to attempt to view the above as investment
   advise, you will probably lose money.)

       You are absolutely right to call attention to the gross
       misallocation of resources of recent years — misallocation on a
       scale so vast as to approach Soviet quality — and are equally right
       to call attention to HST as a phenomenon that exacerbates this.
       However, you are altogether too quick to identify these as
       computing problems. HST for instance could be banned next week if
       the public and government demanded it. Like other speculative
       vehicles, Bitcoin could be also be subjected to regulation to
       reduce the risk of fraud.
       This post therefore makes the fatal error of mistaking symptom for
       disease. Poor fiscal and monetary policy (in short, insufficient
       fiscal stimulus and excessive monetary stimulus through QE) has
       ultimately been responsible for the liquidity that has been put
       mostly to speculative get-rich-quick schemes instead of being
       directed towards productive capacity.
       There are few circumstances under which Bitcoin is remotely
       credible as a currency or store of value, and the this mania, as
       the apotheosis of the current tech bubble, could not be more
       illustrative of the misallocation of resources you describe.
       In short, Silicon Valley has become Wall Street.
       As the Fed taper cycle begins, funding will dry up, and the tide
       will go out, just as it did in late 1999 when the Fed tightening
       cycle began.

            I hope I focused on the underlying incentives that cause the
            problem, but I disagree with your labeling this as a “human
            only” problem. As Big Data becomes more and more sophisticated
            we will see more computation that “accidentally arranges
            itself for self survival”, in a process not unlike the
            formation of early single celled organisms…

       It is sad just how much energy is going to Bitcoin mining…
     * cphv
       I think there are some important distinctions to be made between
       high frequency trading and Bitcoin mining. HFT is, as you say,
       hardly of any benefit to “the common man”. Bitcoin mining on the
       contrary, is used to secure the Bitcoin network, which is of great
       benefit to us all.
       Bitcoin is a global payment network that anyone with internet
       access can use. That is actually an incredibly useful way to spend
       energy since it allows anyone to send money over the internet,
       fast, easy and virtually free.
       There is an enormous amount of resources used in today’s banking
       system for heating buildings and securing and moving cash. That is
       not an issue with Bitcoin.
       Bitcoin mining facilities can easily be (and are already being)
       placed in areas where energy is cheap and abundant. Typically this
       means various kinds of renewable energy. Contrary to HFT machinery
       which is typically placed as close to the stock exchanges as
       possible to get the lowest possible latency.
          + fred trotter
            I certainly concede that Bitcoin is providing a social
            benifit, and even that bitcoin mining is an important
            component in securing the bitcoin network. But there is no
            justification for the ASIC-only specialized computation, or
            for the outlandish amount of electricity that is being spent
            here.
            In order to be “secure” as you mention, mining efforts
            primarily need to be broken up between many participants,
            there is no extra security benefit from ASIC-only computation.
            That delta: between what bitcoin needs to handle secure mining
            and the massive amount of computation that is actually being
            thrown at it… is how bitcoin mining has become malignant.
            Still, this article should not be taken as criticism of
            bitcoin, but rather a call for the adoption of further
            crypto-currencies that do not work in this way. As I mention
            in my article, there is no way to have predicted that bitcoin
            would produce excessive computation.. and we should remain
            amazed that it works at all!!

       I designed the Cuckoo Cycle proof-of-work system at
       https://github.com/tromp/cuckoo whose README I reproduce below.
       Mining is generally considered to be inherently power hungry but it
       need not be.
       It’s a consequence of making the proof of work computationally
       intensive.
       If computation is minimized in favor of random access to gigabytes
       of memory
       (incurring long latencies), then mining will require large
       investments in RAM
       but relatively little power.
       Cuckoo Cycle represents a breakthrough in three important ways:
       1) it performs only one very cheap siphash computation for about
       3.3 random accesses to memory,
       2) its memory requirement can be set arbitrarily and doesn’t allow
       for any time-memory trade-off.
       3) verification of the proof of work is instant, requiring 2 sha256
       and 42 siphash computations.
       Runtime in Cuckoo Cycle is completely dominated by memory latency.
       It promotes the use of commodity general-purpose hardware over
       custom designed single-purpose hardware.
       Other features:
       4) proofs take the form of a length 42 cycle in the Cuckoo graph.
       5) it has a natural notion of (base) difficulty, namely the number
       of edges in the graph; above about 60% of size, a 42-cycle is
       almost guaranteed, but below 50% the probability starts to fall
       sharply.
       6) running time for the current implementation on high end x86 is
       under 24s/GB single-threaded, and under 3s/GB for 12 threads.
       7) making cuckoo use a significant fraction of the typical memory
       of a botnet computer will send it into swap-hell, and likely alert
       its owner.

            I am so happy to know that someone is making practical
            progress on this problem. Can your cryptocurrency change its
            proof of work over time?

                 Which has yet to be adopted…
     * e_ducat
       Its very hard indeed to estimate the amount of energy devoted to
       bitcoin mining precisely because mining can take place in various
       kinds of context. ASICs are far less power hungry than CPUs or
       GPUs. Also, if I am mining in the winter at home, I might be saving
       some energy heating the room. This is not the case with the data
       centers used by the traditionnel finance system where energy is
       spent cooling the aisles. Because Bitcoin reduces the scope of
       traditionnal cash, we are reducing the environmental and social
       costs of running armored trucks filled with bank notes. Last but
       not least, there is a logical fallacy in the article: if mining
       computations can be merged with other purposeful computations, the
       consequence is lowering the cost of a 51% attack because the
       opportunity cost of such attack would be lowered.
       Additionnally, on a macro economic level, the hashing power of the
       bitcoin network is safeguarding it from an easy replication in
       clones that would dilute its money supply in an ocean of worthless
       coins. The many socially usefull applications of the bitcoin public
       ledger will make it worthwhile to spend some amount of energy (the
       équivalent of a solar plant) to run the network: access to
       affordable financial services, contract scripts, escrow, electronic
       votes,etc.
          + fred trotter
            You are not the only one making this point about the reduced
            environmental impact, or about the service securing the
            network.
            I expect a rebuttal to appear shortly which should crystalize
            some of these issues, but I expect my central point will
            remain unchanged. ASIC computing to secure that bitcoin
            network does not end up making it that much more secure than
            GPU mining would but it does result in lots of wasted
            computation.

               o http://www.twitter.com/simondlr Simon de la Rouviere
                 An interesting point someone made (I think it was Peter
                 Todd, a bitcoin core contributor), about the use the
                 computation for other goals besides security of the
                 ledger, is that it provides further incentives to
                 overpower the network, besides monetary gain (or
                 destruction).
                 So, for example, it destroys some of the self-correcting
                 incentives that comes with the Bitcoin network: having a
                 lot of hashing power (say 51%) means you are faced with 2
                 choices. Take part (and gain), or overpower the chain to
                 your will (making it worthless). Currently, these
                 self-correcting incentives work well, as only monetary
                 gain is at stake. This led to players like BTC Guild and
                 GHash.io out of their own volition restrict access when
                 they came close to those levels to retain trust in the
                 network and subsequently their value.
                 IF it’s doing something else as well, say generating
                 prime chains for the scientific community or even a
                 general purpose API for anyone to use, then the
                 self-correcting incentives becoming weaker. A large
                 mining pool might not out of their own volition remove
                 hashing power as their incentive could be altruistic: “We
                 are helping the scientific community. So we won’t pull
                 back. We are providing benefit.” Except this means, pools
                 larger than 51% suddenly become more okay. Which is a big
                 risk in terms of security.

                      You have developped with great clarity the point

                      have our our cake and eat it. Multi-purpose
                      computation goes against the design objectives of
                      bitcoin, namely security and decentralization.

       This is a fascinating article but I suspect the problem of special
       resources consumed by purpose-built bitcoin ASICs is not a very
       large problem. If you asked the chip foundries, they would probably
       tell you demand for these ASICs are no threat to capacity.
       They are neither going to starve any other endeavor of resources,
       nor will they enable some more worthy pursuit to get significant
       benefits from piggybacking. Maybe a big ibank’s trading operation
       has a no-longer-competitive FPGA supercomputer they could give you.
       There would be a lot of redemption in a deal like that.

       I think you mean “for the foreseeable future”, forever is a fairly
       big promise…
       I personally choose to call the Hashing process “mining” only while
       it generates fundamentally new bitcoins, and just call it “hashing”
       after that. Although I am not sure if there is a “industry
       standard” terminology that I should be respecting here, the analogy
       just does not make sense after that point.
