The world's biggest risks

World's richest have same wealth as 3.5 billion poorest

   The combined wealth of the world's richest 85 people is now equivalent
   to that owned by half of the world's population – or 3.5 billion of the
   poorest people – according to a new report from Oxfam.

   In a report titled "Working for the Few" released Monday, the global
   aid and development organization detailed the extent of global economic
   inequality created by the rapidly increasing wealth of the richest,
   warning of the major risks it poses to "human progress."

   According to the report, 210 people have become billionaires in the
   past year, joining a select group of 1,426 individuals with a combined
   net worth of $5.4 trillion.

   It added that the wealth of the richest one percent of people in the
   world now amounts to $110 trillion, or 65 times the total wealth of the
   bottom half of the world's population.

   "This massive concentration of economic resources in the hands of fewer
   people presents a significant threat to inclusive political and
   economic systems," the report said.

   "Instead of moving forward together, people are increasingly separated
   by economic and political power, inevitably heightening social tensions
   and increasing the risk of societal breakdown," it added.

   The report comes ahead of the World Economic Forum in Davos which kicks
   off later this week, and Oxfam is calling on the global political and
   business leaders attending the meeting to take steps to turn around the
   rapidly exacerbating inequality.

   Some recommendations include refraining from the dodging of taxes and
   avoid using economic wealth to seek political favors.

   Income inequality reality check

   A new study shows a third of U.S. bank tellers rely on public
   assistance. CNBC's Kayla Tausche reports the 540,000 bank tellers make
   an average of roughly $26,000. Robert Frank breaks down the wealth gap
   in the U.S.

   Oxfam said that based on its polls conducted across the world, it is
   believed that there are many laws and regulations designed to benefit
   the rich.

   "A survey in six countries (Spain, Brazil, India, South Africa, the UK
   and the U.S.) showed that a majority of people believe that laws are
   skewed in favor of the rich," the report said.

   Oxfam singled out India as an example, where the number of billionaires
   increased from less than 6 to 61 in the past decade, concentrating
   approximately $250 billion among a few dozen people in a country of 1.2
   billion.

   "What is striking is the share of the country's wealth held by this
   elite minority, which has skyrocketed from 1.8 percent in 2003 to 26
   percent in 2008," the report said.

   Oxfam said that India's billionaires acquired their wealth in 'rent
   thick' sectors – industries where profits are dependent on access to
   scarce resources – "made available exclusively through government
   permissions and therefore susceptible to corruption by powerful actors,
   as opposed to creation of wealth."
