The Synthetic Biology Investor’s Lament — By Jenny Rooke

   Jenny Rooke drives innovation in the life sciences field through
   investing and business building around brilliant scientists and
   engineers with novel technologies. Prior, Jenny held multiple executive
   roles at U.S. Genomics.

   As a zealous believer in the potential of synthetic biology, I’ve been
   looking to invest in synthetic biology tools and applications for years
   (not as long as some, longer than many). I’ve even put serious thought
   into raising a venture fund with a focus on synthetic biology
   investments, but, for now, conclude that there simply aren’t enough
   investment-grade opportunities to justify a dedicated fund (yet!). Why
   is it challenging to invest in synthetic biology companies? What is the
   disconnect between that sense of enormous potential and actually
   betting on companies to achieve it (besides investors’ reputations for
   being more risk averse than we’d like to admit)? Here are several
   barriers to investing in synthetic biology that I’ve observed, drawing
   on comparisons to biotech investing more generally.

   Transition from labs to enterprise

   We’re still early in the process of transitioning synthetic biology
   technologies out of research labs and into applied, for-profit settings
   (i.e., companies). In the last decade, the field has seen a profusion
   of novel pathway design tools, gene editing techniques, DNA synthesis
   and sequencing technologies, and analytical tools — all of which fuel
   that sense of synthetic biology’s potential.  We are closer than ever
   to being able to go from an idea for a novel genetic pathway to proof
   of concept, rapidly and inexpensively. But we’re not yet at the point
   where the cost, performance, and scalability of the tools are suitable
   to broad commercial application. As an example, I see a number of
   startups whose business plan hinges on engineering a proprietary
   genetic pathway in a microbial host for production of a particular high
   value chemical. The tools are there to test their hypothesis — which in
   itself is a remarkable advance over even five years ago. But it’s still
   so expensive, slow, and unpredictable that they’ll get only one or two
   shots at making it work on early-stage capital. That’s a fairly high
   degree of technical risk for an investor to embrace.

   Nascent business strategies and models

   We’re still early in demonstrating the business models, partnering
   models, and exit strategies that will work for synthetic biology
   companies. In biotech, entrepreneurs have decades of success (and
   failure) stories to draw upon when deciding what business model to
   pursue to commercialize a novel technology; likewise for investors,
   when assessing the likelihood and value of a company’s options. In
   synthetic biology, those foundational success stories are still being
   written. We can’t rely on established patterns of capital formation and
   value inflections to know how much to invest in a synthetic biology
   company, when, and at what valuation. We don’t have robust data to
   compare to help us predict when a company will be a good acquisition or
   IPO candidate, and at what valuation. Remember, to succeed, investors
   need more than just opportunities to put capital into great companies —
   for returns, they need to be able to get out.

   Diverse applications present unique challenge

   High-value applications of synthetic biology are inherently
   multi-disciplinary, making it especially challenging to build great
   synthetic biology companies. Very few teams (much less individuals)
   comprise the expertise to, say, refactor a biosynthetic pathway in a
   commercially relevant host and develop an effective customer
   segmentation and sales strategy to a relevant industry (e.g. specialty
   chemicals); similarly, very few investors have the expertise and
   comfort to assess both technical and business aspects of a synthetic
   biology company when considering whether to invest. Most synthetic
   biology startups I’ve seen tend to be long on technical expertise, and
   short on knowledge of and access to their intended markets — a risky
   investment proposition. And most investors tend to have either deep
   life sciences expertise or familiarity with synthetic biology target
   markets, but not both — leaving them unable or unwilling to seriously
   consider even best-in-class synthetic biology companies.

   Lack of market transparency and actionable data

   The target sectors for synthetic biology applications (e.g., chemicals,
   feed & food, agriculture and the like) lack transparency, making it
   difficult to identify and assess market opportunities. In biotech, it
   is possible to define a target product profile for a new drug, plan the
   clinical trials required to develop it, and estimate its market
   potential with a fairly high degree of confidence (leaving aside for
   the moment the challenges of actually doing so). Similarly, relevant
   information is widely discussed in biotech conferences, publicly
   available clinical trial documentation, analyst reports, online patient
   forums, and even in the popular media. By contrast, start-ups and
   investors often struggle to find good data about market opportunities
   for synthetic biology innovations; for example, large incumbent
   companies in these sectors often do not break out their revenues and
   margins by specific product lines (e.g., a particular specialty
   chemical). Further, these companies’ needs and strategies around new
   product development and production are often tightly guarded secrets,
   and companies and investors can struggle to gain access to industry
   insiders whose perspectives could provide essential guidance.

   It is clear that these challenges confront both the entrepreneurs who
   would build great synthetic biology companies and the investors who
   would fund them (although not equally — as an investor, I’ll be the
   first to admit that the entrepreneurs have the harder, riskier job). So
   what are we to do? How shall we forge ahead, undaunted, building great
   synthetic biology companies? What can be done to grow the quality and
   quantity of synthetic biology investment opportunities? In my next
   post, I’ll discuss some options for surmounting these barriers, aimed
   at would-be synthetic biology investors.
