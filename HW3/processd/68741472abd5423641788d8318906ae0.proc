   “Google Is About to Let Total Strangers Email You,” a tech site warned.

   Imagine my total lack of alarm, given that, best as I can tell, total
   strangers can already contact me if they can find my email address,
   which isn’t too hard since it’s listed publicly in plenty of places.

   OMG strangers! was just one of many strong reactions to the news that
   Google was opting Gmail users in to a confusing new feature. Here’s how
   it works: Google+ users that you have added to a G+ circle (its version
   of following) will be able to message you in Gmail without needing your
   email address. These messages will look like email, but will appear in
   a Social tab, not your main inbox. Within Gmail, you can disable this
   feature completely or open it to all G+ users, depending on whether
   you’re an Inbox Zero or Inbox Million type of person.

   Given some of Google’s past aggressiveness in trying to solve “social,”
   the vox populi saw this feature as an attempt to force people onto G+.
   In reality, bridge-building between these two services tells us a great
   deal about how Google management envisions the future of identity and
   communications.

1. G+’s real value is as a login platform, on and off Google properties

   Forget all those +1s and the photo-sharing nonsense (what did happen to
   the photos I had on Picasa?). This is about getting you to log into
   Google services. Go back a few years — Google had siloed data on you
   via Gmail, but most of their products you used without ever sharing an
   identity. Now they have one account, most likely using your “real name”
   and a single targeting cookie. Google’s not a search company, it’s a
   data company. And unified profiles give it so much more usable data.

   The same trend is accelerating outside of Google-owned properties.
   Janrain reported that 35 percent of social login on third-party
   services is occurring via Google Accounts. This is no doubt helped by
   the growth of Android and consumer fear that logging in with Facebook
   will lead to sharing of information with their friends.

2. Communication is about permissions, not email addresses, phone numbers or
addresses

   Here’s what I think the integration of Gmail and G+ messaging is really
   about: Making communications about people and permissions, rather than
   possession of contact info.

   If Google Voice was about having a single number attached to you rather
   than a specific device, then Gmail with G+ is about establishing a
   relationship graph between two people, and facilitating communications
   via whatever mode makes sense based upon any number of criteria —
   permissions, preferences, number of people, reason for communication.
   It’s why Gmail + Gchat + G+ Hangouts are all merging into a single
   interface.

   I don’t think Google is alone in perceiving this shift. Facebook has
   tried to integrate more on-platform communication types into its
   product, but really only Messenger has worked. (Remember Facebook Video
   Chat powered by Skype? Or Facebook email addresses?)

   Current generations of kids aren’t going to have to worry about knowing
   your phone number or email or street address. They’ll be able to press
   your name or picture, and depending on the app or need, will initiate a
   text, call, delivery, whatever. Twitter has been experimenting with
   various DM permissioning. And why do you think Snapchat’s user base
   didn’t care much when phone numbers leaked? Because the phone number is
   the least personal data on a phone, compared to your text messages,
   photos or other app data.

   My bet is that a year from now, G+ will be much more about
   communications, with content sharing as part of the interaction, rather
   than a social stream. If you were building Gmail and G+ from scratch
   today, they’d be the same product. And that’s the logic behind the
   messaging permission changes.

   Larry Page is pretty fearless when it comes to moving quickly. Case in
   point: When he assumed the CEO role in 2011, an incremental push to
   review Google’s UX and visual design became a unified sprint touching
   all major properties. I believe this extends to asking the question,
   “If we were starting this product today, would we design it in the same
   way?” If the answer is “no,” then one of two paths result: The product
   is updated, or a new one is built that’s more suited for the future.
   That’s what you’re seeing here, and it may just be the beginning of
   Google’s identity + comms unification.

   here is purely from personal opinion and additional insights from a
   company we funded at Homebrew, which is solving these sorts of
   communication challenges inside of business enterprises.” Reach him

   Very intersting point of view, far from the rage we've read here and
   there. I am fascinated by the evolution of what defines ou identity and
   you are right, this change in Gmail probably doesn't matter much.

   Incidentally, you've made a very pertinent side point:

   "with content sharing as part of the interaction, rather than a social
   stream"

   The (re)emergence of person-to-person platforms (snapchat for instance)
   partially replacing FB/Twitter posts seems to be trendy...

   Hunter, thanks for not continuing the smearing of this new feature.
   It's not as bad as most media outlets have portrayed it. When I first
   signed into Google+ on day one, I immediately saw it as a platform that
   could serve as an email replacement, almost. As it has evolved, I still
   see that possibility. This new link just serves to further that
   potential in my mind.

   Thank Hunter, good points. One clarification,

   > Google+ users that you have added to a G+ circle (its version of

   > following) will be able to message you in Gmail without needing

   > your email address.

   My understanding from articles and from reviewing my G+ settings is
   that the new system allows /any/ G+ user to, once, send email to Gmail
   inbox of any G+ user who hasn't opted out. I received a number of these
   just in the day or two before I changed my settings.

   From my p.o.v. Google actually does not seem altogether smart about
   what I want from identity and contact. I want multiple identities and
   fine-grained control of what contacts / calls on my attention, as fully
   and easily under my control as possible. Unified profiles seem clearly
   about Google's interest in data-mining and tracking me, not my needs.
   I think the conflating of email address with identity has contributed
   to a big privacy/spam problem for a long time, and to examine/combat
   that I've long used a system of giving out context-specific 'tracer'
   addresses, so I can track and manage how they're used.

   Unfortunately, I continue to be baffled at the variety of obvious noise
   and spam Gmail lets into my "important" inbox (autoreplies, in Chinese,
   from addresses I've never sent to or received from, really?).  Baffled
   to not have a simple whitelist option that'd segregate all mail from
   addresses I haven't previously sent to, accepted from, or whitelisted.

   On the other hand, I appreciate and use Google Voice to manage my phone
   interactions.  It puts a useful management layer between the caller and
   the 'actual' contact info at my end, i.e. phone # or device I'm
   actually using. I can redirect it, set up processing rules, route
   everything to voicemail/transcription, and easily block numbers from
   being able to call me again.

   As you suggest, at some point the privacy/contact problem merges into
   the area of UI and notification design.  Anyone *can* find and (try to)
   contact me, but user-centered tools will increasingly filter & stage
   the contact. Most media and tools are still on the dark side of the
   force, in terms of being designed and incented to break into your
   attention rather than conserve it;  but there is a countervailing
   evolution e.g. of better notification design in Android, iOS "Do No
   Disturb" settings, Ted Selker's work on "Considerate Systems," etc.

   > it's so lonely here. who wants to comment?

   Since you asked.. I found it difficult/confusing to comment in this
   Recode setup. The comment box is LiveFyre, but both the "Sign in" link
   and "Post comment as.." link lead to an unlabeled login box that
   doesn't accept my LiveFyre login, or offer login by other networks
   (e.g. Twitter, G+) as I am used to with LiveFyre.

   Apparently I have to create a Recode.net account, but this is
   counter-intuitive, since the comment box is labeled as from a 3rd-party
   comment network, whose main purpose from a user's standpoint is to
   avoid having to create new site-specific login (redundant work,
   additional maintenance/info-decay problem, no reputation metric, have
   to learn new UI/process to do it, etc). The Recode profile asks for my
   phone number and home address (optional, but WTF?) but doesn't let me
   put in eg Twitter handle, web site, or self-description. It seems from
   another era. Also, the "Post comment as.." link repeatedly froze my
   screen, using vanilla Chrome 32.0.1700.77 for Mac.

   I wrote a comment, then tried login, went into signup sequence that
   required email confirmation (for me, involves a delay for Gmail's
   POPmail retrieval).  After confirmation, there was no link back to
   article, and when I went back there via browser history, my comment was
   erased. (I'd kept my own copy, because commenting veteran, but probably
   most people wouldn't).

   I think Recode may need to work on this comment system design some
   more. It's confusing and has a high effort barrier, likely to heavily
   suppress participation.

   This is mostly tangential to your post, I realize, except it perhaps
   can be seen as another, more public case for the design problem of how
   people are able/allowed to contact each other. I happen to have been
   researching this point lately (see "Comment Systems as Urban Form: the
   #OpenComments model"
   http://tjm.org/2014/01/14/proposal-for-opencomments-online-commenting-s
   ystem/).  In online matters, sometimes it seems the topic into which
   all rivers run is Attention. Will fwd comment to Recode too.

   Google enters our entire life:

   - Google+

   - Windows 8 Trojan via Chrome Update

   - Android in the car

   - Android @Home

   Google delivers everything to simplify our life but you have to pay the
   price: Your privacy. May be as a European I am more sensitive than you
   Americans, but I want to be in control of my personal life, my data, my
   mobile profiels and so on. I cancelled ALL the google services in my
   life, same with Facebook and Twitter. Call me an old school boy, but
   with Apple and the Apple Services I have got everything I need to
   manage my life, my communication and my relations as well. Who the hell
   needs this crappy Google?

   @JoshuaTalley yup, i was initially SHOCKED at the feature, then when i
   saw what it actually was, kinda shrugged

   @Tim McCormick  i agree with you on this point i find to be a major one
   for me:

   From my p.o.v. Google actually does not seem altogether smart about
   what I want from identity and contact. I want multiple identities and
   fine-grained control of what contacts / calls on my attention, as fully
   and easily under my control as possible. Unified profiles seem clearly
   about Google's interest in data-mining and tracking me, not my needs.
   I think the conflating of email address with identity has contributed
   to a big privacy/spam problem for a long time, and to examine/combat
   that I've long used a system of giving out context-specific 'tracer'
   addresses, so I can track and manage how they're used.

   i essentially do the same thing, give out a context-specific email
   address, so that i can expect certain information to arrive in specific
   places so i don't have to wade through a lot of noise to keep on top of
   something.

   i guess i am happy i don't have an android phone so that i have to live
   in that type of environment, at least for now.

   decent article hunter.

   @Tim McCormick i thought same re: G+<>GMail but when I went to GMail to
   change my setting the default was "Only in my Circles"
