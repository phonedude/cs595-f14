   The U.S. Forest Service has tightened restrictions on media coverage in
   vast swaths of the country's wild lands, requiring reporters to pay for
   a permit and get permission before shooting a photo or video in
   federally designated wilderness areas.

   Under rules being finalized in November, a reporter who met a
   biologist, wildlife advocate or whistleblower alleging neglect in
   36 million acres of wilderness would first need special approval to
   shoot photos or videos even on an iPhone.

   Permits cost up to $1,500, says Forest Service spokesman Larry
   Chambers, and reporters who don't get a permit could face fines up to
   $1,000.

   First Amendment advocates say the rules ignore press freedoms and are
   so vague they'd allow the Forest Service to grant permits only to
   favored reporters shooting videos for positive stories.

   "It's pretty clearly unconstitutional," said Gregg Leslie, legal
   defense director at the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press in
   Alexandria, Va. "They would have to show an important need to justify
   these limits, and they just can't."

   Liz Close, the Forest Service's acting wilderness director, says the
   restrictions have been in place on a temporary basis for four years and
   are meant to preserve the untamed character of the country's
   wilderness.

   Close didn't cite any real-life examples of why the policy is needed or
   what problems it's addressing. She didn't know whether any media
   outlets had applied for permits in the last four years.

   She said the agency was implementing the Wilderness Act of 1964, which
   aims to protect wilderness areas from being exploited for commercial
   gain.

   "It's not a problem, it's a responsibility," she said. "We have to
   follow the statutory requirements."

   The Forest Service's previous rules caused a fuss in 2010, when the
   agency refused to allow an Idaho Public Television crew into a
   wilderness area to film student conservation workers. The agency
   ultimately caved to pressure from Idaho Gov. C.L. "Butch" Otter.

   With smartphones blurring the lines between reporters and camera crews,
   U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, said the agency should tread
   more carefully.

   "The Forest Service needs to rethink any policy that subjects
   noncommercial photographs and recordings to a burdensome permitting
   process for something as simple as taking a picture with a cell phone,"
   Wyden said. "Especially where reporters and bloggers are concerned,
   this policy raises troubling questions about inappropriate government
   limits on activity clearly protected by the First Amendment."

   Most of the country's wilderness is in the West. Nearly 50 wilderness
   areas have been designated in Oregon, including wide stretches of land
   around Mount Hood, Mount Jefferson and Mount Washington.

   The rules allow exceptions only for breaking news coverage of events
   like fires and rescues. They're more stringent than similar policies on
   wilderness areas managed by a different federal agency, the Bureau of
   Land Management.

   The BLM does not require any special permit for newsgathering in
   wilderness areas.

   By contrast, the Forest Service is giving its supervisors discretion to
   decide whether a news outlet's planned video or photo shoots would meet
   the Wilderness Act's goals.

   "If you were engaged on reporting that was in support of wilderness
   characteristics, that would be permitted," Close said.

   The First Amendment prohibits the creation of laws that abridge press
   freedom. Asked whether the Forest Service believes its rule violates
   the First Amendment, Close replied: "It does not apply to breaking
   news."

   Reporters have many more reasons to go into wilderness areas, however,
   than just to cover fires, rescues or other breaking events.

   The Forest Service is currently accepting public comment on its
   proposal. Those interested can comment online here.

   Correction: This post originally misstated the acreage of wilderness
   areas affected by the proposal. We regret the error.
