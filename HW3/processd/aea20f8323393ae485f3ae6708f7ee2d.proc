   Be Serene—combine the two words and you get Serenbe, a 1,000-acre
   community that integrates the lush landscape of the Georgia countryside
   with a compact, environmentally-oriented mixed-use development of three
   hamlets: Selborne, Grange, and Mado.

   Located 30 miles southwest of Atlanta, Serenbe is nestled in the heart
   of 40,000 acres of forest—now incorporated as the City of Chattahoochee
   Hills—protected by a development plan that preserves 70 percent of the
   area’s green space. A centerpiece of the Serenbe community is the
   25-acre, organic Serenbe Farms, which not only supplies produce to a
   weekly farmer’s market and onsite and regional restaurants, but also
   helps to forge a sense of identity for the overall development.

   Integrating agriculture with homes is only part of the molding of a
   balanced community. With pedestrian-oriented village cores that consist
   of retail, restaurants, galleries, and office space, Serenbe is
   projected to include 1,000 to 1,200 homes and live/work units and up to
   250,000 square feet of commercial among miles of trails, stables,
   pastures, wetlands, and forests

History

   It began with a weekend visit. Serenbe’s founders Steve and Marie
   Nygren—then big names in the Atlanta restaurant scene, with 34
   restaurants and counting—took their three daughters on a weekend outing
   to get to know the Georgia countryside. In 1991, they purchased the
   first 60 acres of what is now Serenbe but, after three years of weekend
   visits, they wanted more. So, they retired from the restaurant
   businesses, sold their home in the city, and relocated the family
   full-time to the countryside. In 1996, they converted the 1930s stable
   next to their home into a guesthouse and opened the Inn at Serenbe.

   As they watched visitors to the lodge interact with the land, returning
   rejuvenated from their forays into nature, they also watched as a spike
   in population growth and rapid housing expansion sent Atlanta’s urban
   sprawl further and further into the Georgia countryside. As the city
   grew, the Nygrens worried that it would soon encroach on their wooded
   community in Chattahoochee Hill Country. Finally, as he recounts it,
   Steve went for a jog one morning in 2000, saw bulldozers on another
   farm, and decided to do something about their concerns.

   Initially, they thought only of protection: buy more land, create a
   green buffer. But, they realized that the demands of growth from the
   burgeoning metropolis were inescapable, and sought a way to integrate
   development with preservation.

   “We started looking and researching about how you can both develop and
   preserve the land,” said Steve Nygren. “We started asking, ‘What does a
   balanced community mean?’”

   They gathered other landowners in the area to discuss how to best
   preserve the natural landscape while also accommodating the inevitable
   need for housing and development. After a series of public meetings and
   discussions, they helped form the Chattahoochee Hill Country Alliance,
   which was tasked with creating a plan to develop the land without
   succumbing to the model of traditional sub-tract suburban communities
   that historically preserve only 20 percent of green space.

   residents.

   The Alliance worked to create a sustainable vision for the estimated
   30,000 residences that were projected to populate this lush hill
   country. By combining various land-use tools, including outright land
   purchase, conservation easements, a transfer of development rights
   program, and the development of zoning that requires mixed-use hamlets
   and villages, landowners and planners from four counties throughout the
   hill country worked together to foster regional growth while ensuring
   that at least 70 percent of the 40,000 acres would remain green space.

   In 2001, the Alliance hired a professional planning firm to create a
   template for development. The plan designers realized that the way to
   preserve the most green space while still allowing room for development
   was through the creation of compact villages tucked within the forest,
   and established the Chattahoochee Hill Country Community Plan. The Plan
   called for a European-village model of high-density residential hamlets
   within walking distance of community centers and commerce combined with
   larger surrounding tracts of open space.

   The final plans ultimately provided the capacity for 20 percent more
   residential units than would have been possible with traditional
   development practices even while preserving over 70 percent of the land
   for agriculture and open space. The project and ensuing plan was so
   well received that community members incorporated the rural area into a
   new city, Chattahoochee Hills, in 2007.

   The Nygrens partnered with Rawson Haverty to build the first of these
   hamlets in the Chattahoochee Hill Country, demonstrating how growth did
   not necessarily have to come at the cost of preservation. In addition
   to the physical land plan, which integrated residential and commercial
   hamlets with forested areas, the Nygrens envisioned Serenbe as a model
   for integrated community based on four central components: art,
   education, wellness, and agriculture.

The Farm

   Serenbe Farms was the first of these components to be developed. While
   the 25-acre organic farm doesn’t occupy central physical presence in
   the Serenbe landscape, it serves as a symbolic and functioning
   centerpiece for the community, creating a distinct residential culture
   as well as a marketable identity for the development.

   pastures, farmland, and eclectic hamlets.

   Nationwide, the demand for locally grown food has coincided with a
   “fundamental change in the way [developers] think about the amenities
   that people like in new home communities,” said Ed McMahon, a senior
   fellow with the Urban Land Institute. “Agriculture is the new golf.”

   Homes near golf courses command up to 50 percent land premiums over
   comparable tract subdivisions. But, “60 percent of golfers who live
   near golf courses don’t play golf,” said McMahon. “They say, ‘I like
   the view across the fairway, I like to live next to protected green
   space.’”

   Serenbe took that “view across the fairway” premium and made it
   productive. Lots at Serenbe command 75 to 150 percent premiums over
   land outside the community, offering the rural appeal of farm living
   without the farm hassle. Homeowners don’t work on the farm, but still
   enjoy access to fresh produce, miles of walking trails, acres of open
   space, and the community that emerges around food.

   In 2009, the five-acre Serenbe farm harvested 56,000 pounds of produce,
   “the whole of which stays within 50 miles,” said Paige Witherington,
   the 28-year-old manager of Serenbe Farms. Produce is distributed to the
   120 residents subscribed to the community supported agriculture
   program, sold at the Saturday farmers market, and to other restaurants
   and vendors in Atlanta. Farm production includes over 50 different
   vegetables, fruits, flowers, and herbs in over 300 different varieties,
   as well as laying hens, shiitake and oyster mushrooms, honeybees, a
   blueberry orchard, and fruit trees.

   The farm is owned by the Serenbe Institute for Art, Culture & the
   Environment (which is funded by fees paid by all incoming homeowners),
   and closed to residents except for designated volunteer days. Keeping
   farm operations independent from individual homeowners or a homeowners
   association helps ensures the long-term viability of the farm.  That
   said, the farmers are an integral part of the community, participating
   in community events and a regular lunchtime fixture at the town’s
   bakeshop.

   “You want the farm to be a permanent fixture in the community,” said
   Daron Joffe, the founder of Atlanta-based Farmer D Organics, who helps
   design and implement residential farms across the country, including
   the farm at Serenbe. “You want it to be sustainable and economical and
   exist independent of the developer or farmer or residents.”

   Serenbe and the region beyond.

   Joffe helped design the farm at Serenbe in 2002, before any houses were
   built. “Putting the farm in the right place is first and foremost the
   most important part,” he said. “At Serenbe, they had an idea for the
   farm, and the developers just put it somewhere on the map. Then, the
   farmer comes in and goes, ‘you picked the worst soil on the property.’
   The location is a really important part of figuring out [the farm] from
   a soils perspective and community interaction.”

   The farm’s harvest has tripled in the five years Witherington has
   worked at Serenbe, partly as a result of this early attention to
   cultivating soil quality.

   The farm was developed at an estimated cost of $50,000, most of which
   went to storage facilities. Nygren amortized this initial investment in
   the farm as part of the Serenbe’s amenities budget. Though the farm was
   subsidized by the development during its first three years of
   operations, it’s now financially sustainable and turned its first
   profit in 2010, said Witherington.

   In addition to the farm, Nygren said that much of the common-area
   landscaping is also edible. Banks of blueberry and fig bushes line
   crosswalks, and pecan and peach trees line street medians. “When kids
   grow up seeing their food grown, it changes their entire attitude,”
   said Nygren. “If you grow up knowing what a fresh blueberry tastes
   like, you’re not going to settle for stuff that’s picked green and
   shipped.”

Community Amenities and Commercial

   While the farm provided an early identity for Serenbe, “We’re not just
   building houses around farms,” said Nygren. “The farm is one of the
   elements that integrates to make it a total connected community.”

   That community so far includes three critically acclaimed restaurants:
   The Blue Eyed Daisy bakeshop, The Hil, and The Farmhouse, all of which
   use produce from Serenbe Farms. Nygren took a gamble and built The Blue
   Eyed Daisy when only four homes had been completed, an early investment
   that paid off in marketing visibility. He estimates 1,000 people visit
   the three restaurants each weekend, which—with reviews in The New York
   Times, Food and Wine, and Bon Appetit—have become destinations in their
   own right.

   The Inn at Serenbe has received similar accolades as a destination for
   those city dwellers looking to dip into country life. Guests can rent
   rooms in the Main Lodge or Lake House, both restored farmhouses, or
   stay in a variety of cottages, ranging from restored 1930s stables to
   modern lofts. Guests can also rent residential spaces within the
   Serenbe community. Rooms start at around $130/night, depending on the
   season, and come complete with Southern charm: afternoon tea, a full
   country breakfast, and use of, among other amenities, a croquet lawn
   and the Serenbe Farms animal village.

   Because it was one of the first buildings completed, The Blue Eyed
   Daisy became a social center for the community. Central post boxes,
   located behind the bakeshop, are a gathering place, “where people stop
   in to talk, forming a social network,” said Shelton Stanfill, who moved
   to Serenbe in 2005 after visiting the lodge for a weekend. “I knew more
   people here by their first name in the first three months I lived here
   than in 11 years living in Atlanta.”

   The Blue Eyed Daisy is located within the hamlet of Selborne,
   surrounded by galleries and other retail as well as townhomes,
   live/work units, and offices. A mixed-use commercial core sits at the
   center of each hamlet. Currently commercial uses are only located
   within the Selborne hamlet, though commercial uses are platted for the
   Grange hamlet, as well. Developers plan for Serenbe to be comprised of
   10 to 15 percent commercial space at buildout.

   The Serenbe Institute, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization, represents
   Nygren’s third pillar of balanced community: art. The Institute’s
   mission is to foster connections between nature, culture, and the arts,
   and seeks “to cultivate the community’s creative, intellectual, and
   ecological qualities through programs and projects that promote our
   social, spiritual, and aesthetic curiosity.” Programs include an artist
   residency, visiting scholar’s residencies, a state-of-the-art film and
   digital photography center, and a playhouse.

   Established in 2010 under the Institute’s auspices, the Serenbe
   Playhouse also hosts open-air theatrical performances throughout the
   summer at different stages within Serenbe. Ticket prices beginning at
   $15, and are open to the public. The Serenbe Photography Center offers
   once-monthly photography workshops and a studio where professional and
   amateur photographers can make prints. Run by Steve and Marie’s
   daughter Kara Nygren, Camp Serenbe offers week-long summer and
   adventure camps for kids aged 3 to 12. Other cultural events include a
   Late Night Cabaret Series, fine arts workshops, and cooking classes.

Schools

   Serenbe is part of the Fulton County school system. Palmetto
   Elementary, Bear Creek Middle School, and Creekside High School are all
   approximately ten minutes away from Serenbe. There are also several
   private schools located near the community.

   In the fall of 2012, Chattahoochee Hills Charter School will open for
   students kindergarten to sixth grade with a mission to integrate the
   arts, agriculture, and environmental education into an
   experiential-based school. The open-enrollment, public charter school
   will be located in the City of Chattahoochee Hills, at the corner of
   Atlanta-Newnan Road and Selborne Way. With a maximum enrollment of 270
   its first year, the school plans to add 45 students a year to
   eventually becomes a full-service K-8 school with an enrollment of 405
   by 2014.

   In 2010, Lisa Miles, a resident of the nearby town of Newnan, opened
   the Children’s House at Serenbe for 15 kids aged 3-6. Though the
   Children’s House is located at Serenbe, the Montessori-based primary
   school is open to students from all over the South Fulton area. The
   Children’s House also offers a toddler program for kids ages 18 months
   to 3 years as well as an afterschool activities program, with nature
   walks, arts and crafts, animal feedings, and music, for kids ages 18
   months to 6 years.

Homes

   Serenbe’s land planner Phill Tabb designed the community as a
   constellation of three interconnected hamlets. The omega-shaped hamlets
   were designed to fit into the natural landscape, facilitating the
   interaction between green, wetland, and watershed areas of the site and
   the sloping hills. Each hamlet will have its own particular character,
   forming part of the pillars of community that the Nygrens initially
   envisioned. The design takes many of its cues from the New Urbanist
   playbook, although the form—a linear English Village folded back on
   itself—is more a walkable grid than the more typical drivable one—a
   fact borne out by the residents, who walk to the Blue Eyed Daisy, the
   mail stations, and the farmer’s market.

   Many residents regularly commute to Atlanta to work, or work out of
   their homes. Eighty percent of families are full-time residents, while
   20 percent are second homeowners, from as far away as California and
   New York. As of 2011, Serenbe had 240 residents in 110 homes, though
   another 224 lots are platted for development and the community has
   zoning approval for 1,000.

   The first community to be built was the Selborne hamlet which, at about
   80 percent complete, is Serenbe’s hub for the arts—visual, performing,
   and culinary. Grange, which is 15 percent complete, is the community’s
   farm hamlet, given its proximity to the Serenbe farms and the Serenbe
   Stables, a boarding and lesson facility open to the public.

   stables, and will front commercial space.

   The planned Mado hamlet—named for the Creek-Indian word meaning “things
   in balance”—will focus on health and wellness. Planned developments at
   Mado include traditional and holistic medical services, assisted
   living, and a destination spa.

   Each of the hamlets are connected by roads, trails, and bridle paths,
   intended to foster a pedestrian-based lifestyle and contribute to
   active living and a coherent sense of place. Living options include
   cottages, townhouses, live/work spaces, and estates, and each hamlet
   will include a mixture of styles.

   Townhouses begin in the mid-$400,000s on 1/8 acre-plots, and provide
   the core anchor of each hamlet. Many of these two- and three-story
   homes are designed with the primary living space on the upper floors,
   known as the “piano nobile.” These long, narrow homes have balconies
   facing the street and any adjacent alley, and are designed to foster an
   urban community feel. According to the Serenbe plan, the architecture
   “will borrow from the antebellum industrial style, such as you find in
   the old dairy ruins on the Serenbe property.”

   The live/work spaces at Serenbe are intended to offer residents compact
   spaces to combine living and working. The ground floor of each of the
   two- or three-story units is a storefront that can be utilized as a
   studio, workshop, or retail space. The living quarters are located on
   the floors above, and the architectural style of the live/work spaces
   will be inspired by local historic downtown areas.

   Estates are placed on larger, unstructured lots of 1/2 acre and are set
   back from the road. Estate lots begin at $250,000. Architectural styles
   are left to the individual property owner to decide, but are to be
   “rural in finish and casual in spirit,” according to the Serenbe
   website.

   Responding to the slow real estate market, some larger lots were
   subdivided to create the Nest, a closely-built hamlet of two- to
   three-bedroom cottages. Of 15 planned cottages, which are priced from
   $260,000 to $455,000, five have already been sold. These smaller
   footprint—and smaller price tag—cottages were an important adaptation
   to the real estate market, attracting buyers who might not otherwise
   have been able to access the townhomes or estates.

   The average house size at Serenbe is 2,500 square feet. As of October
   2011, 224 lots have been platted, with zoning approval for 1,000 lots
   and up to 1,200 projected. Residential lots are approved according to
   unit design and type rather than square footage.

   “We’re still young,” said Tucker Berta, Serenbe’s communications
   director. Serenbe’s development was tracked into three phases: phase
   one is 80 percent complete and developers are 15 to 20 percent into
   phase two. Despite the economy, “[w]e’re pretty much on track from
   where we said we’d be five years ago. We’ve hung on, and still sold
   some houses faster than many other developments around the nation.”

   Indeed, “These kind of communities perform pretty well in the
   marketplace,” said McMahon of the ULI. “Many tend to be on the
   higher-priced side, [because] green space creates value. People are
   willing to pay more for a smaller lot, because the lot comes with a
   farm and 300 acres [of open space]. You’re buying a park along with the
   lot.”

   Homeowners don’t actually own any of Serenbe’s forests or green space.
   The open space land is deeded to a Serenbe land trust, which was
   established separately from the homeowners association. All buyers pay
   a transfer fee to the Serenbe Institute for Art, Culture, and the
   Environment, which is used for the creation of community events and
   programs, the land trust, and other community initiatives. The fee is 1
   percent of the purchase price of a house or 3 percent of the total
   purchase price of an unimproved lot.

Sustainability at Serenbe

   All homes are built to the standards of EarthCraft House guidelines,
   and are placed on and within sites with the goal of creating minimal
   disturbance to the natural terrain. Many homes use geothermal heating,
   and all are designed in relation to the sun to maximize natural heating
   and cooling, with windows placed for cross-ventilation. Instead of
   traditional, water-intensive green lawns, front yards are dotted with
   native plants and organic landscaping that blend into the surrounding
   landscape. Underground trashcans sort trash, recycling and compost, and
   outdoor lighting regulations that eliminate accidental uplighting
   ensure clear, starry skies.

   Water conservation is also a priority at Serenbe. The monthly water
   usage for Serenbe as a community is 25 percent lower than the national
   average. Water conservation practices include water-smart appliances
   like dual-flush toilets and stormwater treatment using natural
   barriers. Wastewater treatment at Serenbe is part of a state-of-the-art
   decentralized natural wastewater system, which is managed by a private
   utility at a cost of about $50 per month for each resident.

   There are four components of the wastewater treatment system. The plant
   is comprised of man-made constructed wetlands—primarily cattails and
   bulrush—filtration basins, and circulating pumps. Collection tanks
   collect household wastewater, retain the solids for decomposition, and
   pass on the liquids to the plant for natural treatment. Single-family
   homes each have 1,500-gallon tanks, and townhomes and live/work homes
   are connected in a communal tank. Once treated, some of the water is
   pumped to the nearby cow pasture and released into the ground through
   piped sub-surface drip lines. The remaining greywater is pumped to
   individual yards for use in sub-surface drip irrigation.

   Serenbe is located in the heart of Chattahoochee Hill Country, a
   65,000-acre, rolling hill forest and a prime destination for cyclists,
   runners, and hikers.

   According to a commissioned study by Atlanta-based Arborguard Tree
   Specialists, the trees at Serenbe—most commonly the loblolly pine,
   white oak, sweetgum, and water oak—store 1,333,840 tons of carbon and
   sequester an additional 52,660 tons of carbon per year. The trees also
   remove 1,484 tons of pollution a year from the air, which is the
   equivalent of the carbon emissions of 182,717 cars in a year (or, the
   emissions of 106,792 single-family homes in a year). Because the
   region’s winds blow northwest through this hill country before they
   reach metro Atlanta, the air in Atlanta is measurably cleaner than it
   would be without these preserved green spaces—and the air in Serenbe is
   the cleanest in the Atlanta Metro area.

Conclusion

   Ultimately, communities like Serenbe offer a philosophical challenge to
   the traditional real estate model—people think “you either have
   development or you have agriculture,” said McMahon. “You wouldn’t buy a
   car by the pound, but what we’ve done with houses is sold them by
   square feet.” Developments like Serenbe are selling something
   different, something integrated: community, expansive open space,
   access to agriculture, and a distinct relationship to the land and the
   food we eat.
