   E-bikes make urban cycling more practical and accessible, but they
   aren’t exactly sexy.

   The Vanmoof Electrified, made by a Dutch cycling company that focuses
   solely on making bikes for urban commuters, aims to change all of that
   with a sleek and intelligent design that gives the e-bike a practical
   and visual facelift.

   Using innovations from the auto industry, including fully-integrated
   powerful LED lights, anti-theft GPS tracking, and a simple fob key, the
   bike feels like a joy to ride--a far cry from the clunky models that
   many associate with e-bike technology.

   “E-bikes are the future, but not the way they’ve been designed so far.
   We really believe we’ve managed to create a product that attracts a
   whole different target group,” says Vanmoof’s marketing director Niels
   Bark.

   The company is already known for innovative and simplified design for
   the inner-city commuter.

   Its other bikes feature interesting features like a heavy-duty lock
   that hides away inside the bike.

   The company focuses on crowdsourcing early feedback from users. With
   the Electrified, it has had more than 100 people in cities around the
   world become early testers since last Fall.

   As Vanmoof gets ready to start shipping the bike this summer (it’s
   available for pre-sale now), I test rode the Electrified at Rolling
   Orange Bikes, a Dutch cycling shop in Brooklyn and one of Vanmoof’s 350
   dealers around the world.

   The first unusual feature about the e-bike is that you don’t notice
   it’s an e-bike at all.

This Sleek Commuter Bike Has A Secret: You Hardly Have To Pedal

   The first unusual feature about the Vanmoof Electrified is that you
   don’t notice it’s an e-bike at all.

   E-bikes make urban cycling more practical and accessible, but they
   aren’t exactly sexy. In New York City, they’re synonymous with
   restaurant deliverymen, and in some cases are illegal. In Europe, for
   many years, they’d mostly been used by the elderly.

   The Vanmoof Electrified, made by a Dutch cycling company that focuses
   solely on making bikes for urban commuters, aims to change all of that
   with a sleek and intelligent design that gives the e-bike a practical
   and visual facelift. Using innovations from the auto industry,
   including fully-integrated powerful LED lights, anti-theft GPS
   tracking, and a simple fob key, the bike feels like a joy to ride--a
   far cry from the clunky models that many associate with e-bike
   technology.

   “E-bikes are the future, but not the way they’ve been designed so far.
   We really believe we’ve managed to create a product that attracts a
   whole different target group,” says Vanmoof’s marketing director Niels
   Bark.

   The company is already known for making extremely simple bikes for a
   city commuter. Its other bikes include interesting features like a
   heavy-duty lock that hides away inside the bike. The company also
   focuses on crowdsourcing early feedback from users. With the
   Electrified, it has had more than 100 people in cities around the world
   become early testers since last Fall.

   As Vanmoof gets ready to start shipping the bike this summer (it’s
   available for pre-sale now), I test rode the Electrified at Rolling
   Orange Bikes, a Dutch cycling shop in Brooklyn and one of Vanmoof’s 350
   dealers around the world. (The shop owner, Marc van der Aart, reassured
   me that the Vanmoof is legal to ride in New York, since it only uses
   pedal-assist technology--only e-bikes that are fully motorized are
   illegal).

   The first unusual feature is that you don’t notice it’s an e-bike at
   all, as van der Aart points out to me. There are no visible cables. The
   motor and battery pack are nicely hidden with the frame of the bike, in
   the top bar. To start the bike, I used the clicker and a small
   unobtrusive touch-screen panel lit up on the frame just under the
   handle bars. Unlike other e-bikes with complicated options and many
   gears, here there are only two options--100% power assist, and 50%
   power assist--plus a battery charge indicator.

   The ride on Brooklyn’s streets was as smooth as could be, considering
   the enormous pot holes left by the unusually harsh winter this year.
   Like most cyclists in New York City and throughout the U.S.--where
   e-bikes have not really caught on like they have in Asia and Europe--I
   had never ridden an e-bike before. The Vanmoof Electrified is designed
   to be responsive, so the motor gives an appropriate boost tuned to how
   hard the rider is pedaling, based on sensor feedback from the bike's
   on-board computer. I could keep up with the slow-moving cars with ease.
   That said, I might be able to do nearly the same on a regular bike--it
   would just take more effort.

   The coolest and most unique feature of the Vanmoof Electrified is the
   GPS tracking system. The company worked with Vodafone to integrate GPS
   into the bike. A system can track the bike if it gets stolen or if you
   simply forget where you parked it. One early tester in Florida actually
   had his Vanmoof stolen and recovered undamaged by the West Palm Beach
   police department using the GPS system. It’s a great idea, though
   thieves could probably figure out how to work around it if such systems
   become common.

   At $2,998, the price for the Vanmoof is steep and certainly won’t be in
   reach for everyone. I live on the third-floor of an apartment building,
   and though Vanmoof used a smaller battery so that the bike is
   surprisingly light, I still wouldn’t make it up two flights to charge
   it in my wall outlet. Still, for those who can afford it, it would be a
   great option for riders who want to extend their biking range in New
   York City or even replace their car.

   After all, as in most large cities, one major limitation for New York
   cyclists is distance. A 15-mile bike ride to do a quick errand on the
   other side of town isn’t always an option. And in the middle of summer?
   It’s a sweaty mess. The range of the battery is 30 to 60 kilometers (19
   to 37 miles), and it still gives a smooth ride as a regular bike once
   the battery dies.

   “There are a lot of people who would like to go cycling to work, but
   the distance is a little too far. You can basically use it as a car in
   a city,” says Bark.
