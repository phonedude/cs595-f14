       May 21, 2014

   This editorial is the first in a series. Next week, restaurant owner
   Dave Meinert and 15 Now activist Jess Spear debate “total
   compensation”—including the question of whether a restaurant worker’s
   tips should count toward their pay.

   In case you've been asleep since November, Seattle is at the epicenter
   of a national debate about the crisis of inequality. Much of the debate
   here has centered on the costs and benefits of a $15 minimum wage, how
   fast to get to $15, or why $15 and not some other number.

   As members of the advisory committee that will be offering
   recommendations to the mayor next month, we know there'll be policy
   options aplenty. We're hearing from all sides about the trade-offs and
   consequences.

   But we want to be very clear: $15 isn't just about $15. It's about
   recognizing what actually makes this city so special—and making a
   conscious effort to nurture it.

   Though there are cities in America bigger than Seattle, no city can
   match our combination of economic dynamism and civic engagement. While
   we have plenty of successful capitalists in Seattle, this isn't a town
   like Dallas or New York that worships the super-wealthy and believes in
   trickle-down economics.

   People here recognize that prosperity and community emerge from the
   middle out, not the top down. That we're connected in an ecosystem.
   That we're all better off when we're all better off. It's why so many
   companies here treat their workers better than the market says they
   have to. Compare Costco to Walmart. Or Starbucks to McDonald's. Or Tom
   Douglas restaurants to Olive Garden.

   This "Cascadian" form of capitalism works—for everyone, not just for
   capitalists. And we believe that raising Seattle's minimum wage to $15
   in a speedy, simplified, and practical way will make our city more
   competitive and bring giant benefits, both economic and civic.

   Let's start with the economics. Most champions of a higher minimum wage
   base their arguments on fairness and social justice. They're right. But
   we want to offer another argument: It would be great for business.

   The fundamental law of capitalism is that when workers have more money,
   businesses have more customers. Raising the minimum wage shifts money
   in the economy to those with the highest propensity to spend,
   increasing sales for businesses, which in turn leads to hiring, and
   more sales.

   Because the current minimum wage in Washington is $9.32, some people
   think $15 would be an exorbitant leap. But if the minimum wage were
   enough to support one childless worker in King County, by even very
   conservative estimates, it would be more than $16. If it had tracked
   productivity gains since 1968, it would be $21.70. And if it had
   tracked the wages of the top 1 percent, it would be $28.

   These aren't teen jobs, by the way. The average age of a fast-food
   worker is 28. And minimum-wage jobs aren't confined to a small corner
   of the economy. By 2040, it is estimated that 48 percent of all
   American jobs will be low-wage service jobs.

   Trickle-down advocates would have you believe that a $15 minimum wage
   makes Seattle less competitive. We disagree. Yes, there may be
   businesses that today depend on paying workers near-poverty wages that
   will need to change their ways—or leave. But making Seattle the
   highest-minimum-wage city in America gives businesses a more secure and
   growing base of customers, and from that base, this city becomes a
   better place to be an entrepreneur and innovator.

   The argument against a minimum-wage hike treats workers simply as costs
   to be cut, in order to push prices ever lower. This is the Walmart
   bargain. But here's the thing: No matter how low Walmart's prices get,
   its workers still can't afford to live on Walmart wages. Walmart made
   $27 billion in profit last year. And its workers are among the nation's
   largest group of food-stamp recipients, a program best understood as a
   taxpayer subsidy of Walmart's profits. This is an arrangement as
   inefficient as it is immoral.

   The Walmart model (which, by the way, is prevalent across the poor,
   unhealthy, dole-dependent states of the former Confederacy) is a race
   to the bottom. What we need is a race to the top, in which higher wages
   generate more demand, in turn generating more hiring and higher wages.
   This is middle-out economics. It's Cascadian capitalism. And it's a
   whole lot better for you than trickle-down Confederate capitalism.

   We think public policies should advantage locally owned small
   businesses over quick-serve national chains that are economically
   extractive and culturally dilutive (what neighborhood was ever enriched
   by the arrival of a McDonald's?). Local small businesses should get a
   longer phase-in period for any wage hike, for instance. But even if it
   takes longer, they eventually should be held to the same simple
   standard: Someone who works full-time in Seattle should be able to live
   in Seattle.

   People who oppose an increase in the minimum wage often point to
   "unintended consequences." And there are real costs to any change. We
   know that. We don't think $15 should happen overnight, and we think
   certain sectors like small businesses and nonprofits should get more
   time to get there.

   But the term "unintended consequences" implies that all consequences
   must be negative. That's just not true. There will be unforeseen
   positive consequences, too, as most studies show: business benefits
   like higher worker satisfaction and productivity, lower turnover and
   absenteeism. And those positives cancel out the negatives. Minimum-wage
   increases have no net negative effect on employment—and a definite
   positive effect on community health.

   Which brings us to the civic dimension of what $15 is really about.

   Consider the 12th Man phenomenon that unified our city. Some outsiders
   assume that the success of the Seahawks generated this incredible wave
   of popular solidarity. But they got it backward. It's our spirit of
   mutuality and common cause—stronger here than in most big American
   cities, according to national reports—that powered the fans who powered
   the Hawks.

   Even as Seattle has become dramatically wealthier in the last
   generation, we haven't wanted to become San Francisco. We haven't
   adopted the hyperindividualistic mantra of "every man for himself."
   Seattle is less prone than Texas to divide the world into makers and
   takers. We volunteer more, we participate more, and we link up to solve
   local problems more regularly than citizens in other cities do.

   But we're also, undeniably, becoming a more unequal community—in
   incomes and in opportunity. The danger we have to face is that economic
   inequality always begets political inequality, which always begets more
   economic inequality. Low-wage workers stuck on a path to poverty are
   not only weak customers, they're also anemic taxpayers, absent
   citizens, and inattentive neighbors.

   To put it in the affirmative, we have a chance now with $15 to make
   Seattle as civically robust as it already is economically. We have a
   chance to set off a virtuous cycle in which economic participation
   begets civic participation. True prosperity doesn't trickle down from
   above, and neither does great citizenship. Both are middle-out
   phenomena.

   When workers earn a wage that they can survive on in Seattle, they can
   help their kids with homework and keep them out of trouble, look out
   for neighbors, join community groups. And as we saw during the
   successful SeaTac $15 campaign, they can participate more meaningfully
   in self-government. They can see themselves as participants, not
   spectators. They can speak out on issues and organize others. They can
   assume their views will be heard.

   And all this recirculates into our economy. Better citizens make better
   customers, and better customers make better neighbors, in an endless
   virtuous circle. This is how Seattle has thrived. And it's how we'll
   win in the future. The rest of the country has run a 30-year
   trickle-down experiment, and the result has been an economy and a
   politics rigged for the very richest. The people who benefit most from
   that arrangement are desperate for us to believe this is the only way
   an economy can work. Screw that, and them. At the end of the day, $15
   isn't about just rejecting that approach. It's about replacing it.

   I appreciate this:
   Someone who works full-time in Seattle should be able to live in
   Seattle.
   But it's important to note that wages alone can't do this. If we want
   to make Seattle affordable we also have to insure that a sufficient
   quantity of housing is being built. Our zoning laws don't make this
   extremely difficult, and it's not just height restrictions. In much of
   Seattle, it's perfectly legal to tear down a 100 year old 1200 SF
   craftsman and replace it with a 4000 SF McMansion. But it would not be
   legal to replace it with a 4000 SF 6-8 unit building. This is bad for
   the environment and for affordable housing. These limits mean that
   those lucky enough to actually build are only going to focus on the
   high end of the market. Let's not forget the other fronts in the fight
   for an economy that works for everyone. Without sufficient housing
   supply, wages will not be able to keep up with the cost of living.

   "business benefits like higher worker satisfaction and productivity,
   lower turnover and absenteeism." Why? It's just the new minimum wage.
   It's not like they can't just find another job that pays $15/hr if they
   get fired for poor productivity or absenteeism. But how about those of
   us who are making $15/hr after years of service, and spending a chunk
   of that money towards student loans that were accrued in order to make
   a higher wage than minimum wage? My company, and the vast majority of
   others, will not be raising everyone else's wage to be $5.68/hr more
   than their current wage in order to maintain the standard. So we get
   left behind. There goes our motivation and productivity.

   The state needs to set a formula whereby cities and counties can
   establish a minimum wage based on the cost of living in each city and
   county and indexed to the cost of living for subsequent increases.
   Different cities and counties would then have a minimum wage that fits
   their economy. Forcing a universal average on the whole state creates
   an imbalance wherein people in Seattle are underpaid and businesses and
   customers in smaller cities with lower costs of living are overburdened
   and overcharged.
   We need a formula that sets a state average, but allows for
   differentiation and fluctuation based on the diverse, local economic
   realities in each community.
   In addition the city and county need to levy a penalty tax on
   residential rental properties that increase rent significantly more
   than the annual rise in the cost of living apart from housing.
   One more thought - the city, county and state should be developing a
   legal and financial environment that promotes worker ownership. The
   promotion of investor owned businesses has resulted in a massive
   economic imbalance, highly exploitive business practices and corrupt
   governance. We need to transition from a market based on exploitation
   and self-interest to one based on cooperation and mutual interests.
   Workers must become owners of their work and have a voice in the
   governance.
   We all deserve to make a living, but no one deserves to make a killing.

   I predict that one of the best things to come from this will be the
   solidarity of having a massive group of people all making the same
   hourly rate.
   I remember when I was a cashier at $7/hr I resented my friend the line
   cook who made $9. Then when I became a cook I resented the bussers who
   made $11 and so on. I'm sure it won't last long, but I do know that
   equality is good for the soul, and having the general mass of service
   workers all making the same hourly rate is going to create a lot of
   happiness. More money in the pocket is good, but more equality in the
   social ladder is better.
   And maybe once the thousands upon thousands of 15-ers all start seeing
   themselves as one, they'll band together to keep improving things for
   themselves (I say "they" but 2 years ago and possibly again in the
   future it will be "we")

   I'm certainly in support of a living minimum wage, but the title is
   just not true. While it will help many businesses, it's a unavoidable
   fact that it will hurt some. Now I would argue that it's an acceptable
   cost, and society shouldn't have to subsidize businesses who's balance
   sheet doesn't support a living wage to employees.

   This is a terrible piece. Please, drop the platitudes and examine real
   consequences and realities.
   "Someone who works full-time in Seattle should be able to live in
   Seattle."
   This is a red herring in the ongoing argument. Nearly a quarter million
   people commute to Seattle for work. There are undoubtedly many reasons,
   but one is the cost of living is so high in the city. Having a dramatic
   increase only makes that worse. Out of big cities in the United States,
   San Francisco has the highest minimum wage (and it's not even a dollar
   more than Washington state's min) and guess what? Housing there,
   especially rent, is among the highest in the country (and according to
   many sources, it is the highest).
   That's not really a good model to follow. Additionally, what large,
   prosperous city is affordable to live in for the lower end of the
   economic scale? Maybe Houston? Either way it's a thin, thin list.
   I'm not a fan on hew long many things take to finally bloom, but this
   would have massive local and regional impacts, and such gravity should
   require less feel-good platitudes and more very, very careful and
   meticulous examination.

   Inflation occurs when money is created, either vie government printing
   or bank loans.
   Raising the minimum wage simply moves a portion of the income a given
   business makes from the shareholders, who have a low marginal
   propensity to consume, to the people at the bottom, who have a high
   propensity to consume.
   The price of eggs, milk, shoes, and clothing isn't going to spike just

   The main important takeaway from this article is that $15 is wholly
   inadequate. Even $21.70, even were it pegged to productivity as a
   living wage law, would be barely adequate. Capitalism per se is the
   problem; you can't steal from working people to enrich a tiny
   aristocracy and expect it to be sustainable.

   This heartwarming, but poorly constructed argument lacks any mention of
   how a >60% increase in the wage floor would effect labor demand. Even
   Sawant would give this an "F."

   "The price of eggs, milk, shoes, and clothing isn't going to spike just
   because people who need them can suddenly afford them."
   Correct.
   It will, however, spike because the cost of labor at the grocery store
   will increase by 60%

   To the authors: your heart is in the right place but get yourselves an

   @25, prices going up to pay for massively increased labor costs =
   increased inflation.
   Do you think raising the minimum wage to $25 would be a good idea or a
   bad idea, and why?

   I work at a grocery store. I make minimum, journeymen make slightly
   above $17 per hour. When one of them calls in sick and I sub for them,
   that wage difference goes directly to corporate.
   I am aware of the profit margins, and they are not so thin that price
   hikes will be needed to keep the large chains viable. The pure profits
   received by shareholders will be lower than they might be otherwise.

   will be "needed" to keep the large chains viable. But corporate most
   definitely will not be taking a pay cut in order to accomodate the pay
   increase for their minimum wage employees (60% is pretty significant).
   They will increase prices in order for their profits to stay the same.

   I think it's telling that people are attacking the way this piece is
   written rather than what it's saying or the facts it's built on. The
   economics strongly support what Nick Hanauer is writing about. $15/hour
   is a good policy, and is actually probably a bit short of where we need
   to be as a city.
   That said, I had my own problems with the style and tone of this piece.
   It plays hard to the prejudices of localism, where we are special and
   better than those outsiders from California and New York and Texas. The
   fact is, we're not. I guess it's a smart move because the balance of
   political power in Seattle is held by people who believe in our own
   myth, but in the bigger picture this is good for workers and business
   everywhere, in every city, and we gain little by playing off petty
   local resentments.

   This means NO MORE gratuities, right? If I'm paying $20 for a big mac,

   not receive tips for my job (which will be very close to minimum wage)
   neither will those people who are "just doing the job that they are

   hard and spent thousands of dollars on college educations? Don't you
   think that they are going to want higher pay then those who did nothing
   to better their lives or job prospects? All the people who have hit a

   sitting back waiting for the world to be served up on a silver platter
   while wasting their lives away playing XBOX and PS3. You get what you

   Cascadian capitalism? Confederate capitalism? Rhetoric. And a lot of
   numbers impersonating data before the research is presented and Income
   on Inequality Symposium has even happened.
   How is this for civic engagement?
   I am a resident of Seattle and a small business owner. My friends are
   artists, musicians, employees of low wage jobs, employees of non-profit
   social services and other small business owners. I am a proud
   progressive and have unparalleled civic pride.
   Our opinions on political issues may vary but we all agree:
   -there is undeniable support and momentum to raise the minimum wage
   -raising the minimum wage to $15Now is unacceptable
   I encourage all of you, from every walk of life and ideology to
   consider what is at stake and be realistic about the impending
   situation. Up until now you may have been prideful, afraid or still in
   disbelief, but you are not alone. Not by a long shot. The critical
   thinkers who care about a thoughtful sustainable implementation of a
   minimum wage ordinance are going to go public next week and can give
   you shelter. We are in every neighborhood, we are your next door
   neighbor and corner store.
   We organized because there is no forum where people can talk about
   their concerns without being attacked. I implore you to be aware of
   disinformation and get answers for yourself. There is a void of any
   other public opinion. The opposition to $15Now must make its voice
   heard immediately.
   Let's change the conversation. Stand up for a pragmatic, ordinance that
   will allow for gradual adjustments to be made.

   It all sounds great, but it's all an illusion. You get a bigger check,

   bakers, farmers, dairy, everyone has to make price adjustments to pay
   $15.00 an hour. Now they have a smaller customer base, due to inflated
   prices. At the end of the month the only one with more money is the
   government. You're expenses are higher, so they collect more tax, the
   IRS is now taxing you at a higher rate. It will close business, and
   unemploy thousands Huge mistake. I understand that you likely cannot
   support a family at McDonald's...etc. on the current minimum wage, but
   it was never meant to. I was for college and High School kids to make
   some money. Basically an entry level for starting out, or a few extra
   bucks when the nest is emptied. My fiance' repairs airplane parts to
   keep people in the air for $22.00 an hour, can you honestly tell me
   that his profession is worth $7.00 an hour more than a fast food

   1. The numbers in this article do not match the number provided by city
   council's own policy analysts, circulated at last friday's council
   meeting. According to them numbers, livable wage for a single resident
   of the city should be $10.62
   2. Anybody that thinks that wage inflation will not affect prices is
   completely wrong. The big corporations are not going to "share" their
   profits, they will increase prices. Wholesalers will compensate higher
   overhead in a similar manner. Eggs and milk will be more expensive.
   3. With rent hikes being left on the back burner, a huge percentage of
   the wage increase will line up the pockets of the landlords. Simple-
   not enough rental units supply, higher demand, more disposable income
   on the lower tier- higher rent.
   4. The only people who will finance this expansion are the middle
   class- workers and small business owners alike. There is not going to
   be a fresh influx of cash in the system which can alleviate that. In
   other words, middle class will spend less or stop tipping. That would
   create business closures or employee actual income erosion, since
   guaranteed 15 for a bartender is half of what they currently bring
   home.
   All that said, I agree with @38- viable solutions that can push us
   towards wage increase without destroying the city fiber and its economy
   are circulating out there, even though they are not formulated
   completely yet. The sooner any of these proposals hit the street- the
   better informed everyone would be and better chance the city will have
   to actually accomplish the goal of mitigating income inequality.

   Previous posters have pretty well picked apart the weak arguments and
   cherry-picked facts presented in this article. Among my favorite quotes
   from the article is this one:
   "We think public policies should advantage locally owned small
   businesses over quick-serve national chains that are economically
   extractive and culturally dilutive."
   Setting aside the rhetorical emptiness of terms like "culturally
   dilutive" - which is void of ANY substance but will no doubt appeal to
   many Stranger regulars - the author seems to think that a $15/hr
   minimum wage would advantage small local businesses over large national
   ones - given a little creative enforcement of the law, of course (ACA
   anyone?).
   Nothing could be further from the truth. It is the big boys with the
   deep pockets who will be able to survive the financial hardship of a
   $15 minimum wage hike. They are the ones with the financial resources
   to weather the storm and perservere while their smaller, weaker rivals
   go belly up. What this will in fact do is help the big boys consolidate
   the market info fewer and fewer entities (and fewer and fewer consumer
   choices) as the little guys with shallow pockets and thin margins are
   priced out of the market altogether by yet another government mandate.
   Somehow the feel-good policies that progressives like Hannauer and
   Comrade Sawant are so keen to promote always turn into a lesson in
   unintended consequences. This misguided proposal will be no different.

   The Evans school report says that:
   70% of Native American/Alaska Native workers in this city earn below
   $15, as do
   49% of Latin@ workers, and
   43% of Black workers, and
   41% of Asian/Pacific Islander workers.
   We keep talking about how unfair it would be to people who make $15.50
   or similar already, or unfair to businesses, but when you have several
   groups for whom it is either all-but guaranteed or a fair chance that
   they will make less than they need to survive you need to understand it
   is gravely unjust as a system. This happens whether or not your
   business succeeds or fails. And as a business owner you're still
   clearly able to float loans and do a whole variety of things to
   survive, whereas there are whole groups that are largely destined to
   simply move away or die in poverty.
   It's great that some have the luxury of saying "we might have to close
   one location" or "we may have to downsize" or "we may have to close".
   All too many people in the city of Seattle -- named after a Native no
   less -- don't have anything of the sort. They bite their nails at every
   resume they submit, they shudder and suffer when they get a rent bill,
   they question their ability to even pay next month's phone bill, and
   all because they had the audacity to be born into a tribal nation or to
   be born with dark skin or to be born in another country.
   We want our city to be innovative and some have even said an increased
   minimum wage may stifle innovation among business owners. But what
   about those people who can barely afford to live in this city, not for
   failure to "pull themselves up by their bootstraps" but because the
   system you're all so keen on is intensely racist? You know, we say how
   much we love NW Coastal art, we adorn our city in it like jewelry, but
   what about those native artists who are 7/10 times likely to earn less
   than $15 if they can even manage to be hired in the first place? If
   we're so committed to innovation, what about them?
   Why are people defending a gravely unjust system?

   The idea that increased wages will pay for themselves and result in
   more prosperity doesn't cut it mathematically. Simple example:
   If I pay you $10 to do a job, and then you buy a $5 item from me, I
   have lost $5 and you have $5 in your pocket, plus the item you
   purchased.
   Now you suggest, I pay you more, and in return you will spend that
   extra money at my business...sounds great eh? I win, you win?
   So now I pay you $20 to do the same job, and with your newfound raise,
   you buy $10 worth of stuff from me. I am now out $10 and you have $10
   in your pocket, plus the items you bought. This doesn't scale...I lost
   $10 instead of $5. Even if the things I sold cost me nothing to make, I
   still lost $10 on this transaction.
   Or slightly different scenario. I pay you $20 and now you buy $15 worth
   of good from me. As people like to suggest, you've now poured all that
   money back into my business. I am now out $5 and you have $5 in your
   pocket, plus the goods you purchased from me. How am I prospering? The
   extra money you are giving back to me is, by definition, no more then
   the extra money I gave you...and I am now out the product I sold you as
   well and must purchase more.
   There are good reasons for increasing the minimum wage, but the idea
   that it will somehow pay for itself is a pipe dream. It's trickle down
   economics in reverse. Give the low earners more money and they'll
   reward you by giving it back to you.

   This is part of the problem with the minimum wage argument: it, too
   often, branches out to attempt to address issues that it itself does
   not address or help.
   The effects of raising the minimum wage are not static. It is not that
   all of a sudden people earning minimum wage to $14.99 get a raise and
   everything proceeds as it was with the exception of more money in the
   hands of lower wage workers. Please tell me how having fewer jobs
   available and increased costs for goods and services (including rent)
   to the residents of Seattle and the region helps those on the bottom of
   the economic ladder or those who are seeking employment?
   If you're seeking to right the injustices as you say, this is NOT the
   way to do it, because it will do the opposite despite your intentions
   or desires.

   This is a pointless article, there is barely any info addressing the

   1. Why wouldn't $15/hr cause employers to lay-off some employees due to
   the extra cost?
   2. Why wouldn't employers pass on the additional cost to the consumer,
   as they do in all other industries? In many cases these customers are
   the same income level as the employees they hire.
   3. Why do fast food workers even deserve $15 an hour? It's an industry
   that promotes terrible health in the first place. Workers such as
   myself with college loans to pay off are working for less than that
   amount in offices and other business', what will the repercussions of
   their huge pay increase be on all other professions? Don't answer this
   with, "why don't you go work at McDonalds then?" Clearly that isn't a
   solution.
   This whole plan is pretty flawed. Like how this article says increase
   pay causing less absenteeism and greater moral is somehow enough reason
   to out-weight any negatives. That statement basically suggests these
   people are so lazy they need a giant wage increase to be halfway decent

   that wage level. He falls back on stale assurances that (undefined)
   "small business" won't be hurt by this.
   It's mostly superficial rah-rah.

   No. Jobs are McDonalds aren't "meant" for anything but to make money
   for McDonalds. The minimum wage is only "meant" (and right now failing)
   to make sure that someone working full-time can pay for the very basic
   things in life, without falling into poverty.
   I don't know where you get this idea that the minimum wage and
   fast-food jobs are somehow a jobs program for high-school kids. The
   vast majority of minimum-wage workers are not high-school kids, and the
   minimum wage was not designed with kids in mind. It was designed,
   during the labor movement, with *workers* in mind.
   Also, I could care less if your boyfriend only feels good if he's
   making x amount more than the lowest-paid workers. I started with a
   minimum wage job, and now make 3x the current minimum wage. I don't
   have time for any fucking nonsense from a worker who makes so much more
   than the minimum wage and wants to keep it that way. That is some weak
   shit.

   History can be our guide. We've had dozens of minimum wage increases in
   the past, and most of those were unprecedented. Unprecedented! And
   always they said there were going to be job losses.
   And the jobs didn't disappear. Over the long run, high minimum wage
   places like Washington did well and "business friendly" Idaho and
   Wyoming continued to swirl the drain.
   What you guys need is to cite actual examples of a wage increase
   leading to employers disappearing and jobs drying up. Why don't you
   guys ever do that? Because the actual record shows Hanauer is right --
   even after the 80+% wage increase for tipped employees after I-518 in
   1988. This $15 is only a 60% increase, smaller than in 1988, and it
   didn't cause a ripple.
   Reality simply doesn't favor supply side economics. It's time to let
   Reagan die.
   The cool part: after Seattle gets $15/hr, the rest of the country can
   follow suit, and it won't be "unprecedented". The writing is on the
   wall.

   So your entire argument is based on an initiative from 26 years ago
   that applied to only a small fraction of jobs - tipped positions - that
   already had their own unique minimum wage that was set well below the
   state minimum. That's hardly a convincing argument.
   As you know, the current proposed minimum wage will apply to ALL jobs,
   and will entail a $5/hr increase rather than the $1.50/hr increase that
   resulted from I-518.
   Furthermore, the argument that somehow Washington's economy is so much
   stronger than Idaho or Wyoming because of differing minimum wages is
   absurd. You are comparing land-locked, overwhelmingly rural states with
   very low populations to that of Washington, with it's major ports,
   large urban centers, and much larger population base. The classic
   Apples and Oranges scenario.
   Sorry, but the burden of proof lies with the supporters of this
   proposed law, not the other way around.
   By the way, President Reagan died a few years ago. Perhaps you missed
   it.

   I think that most agree the minimum wage should be increased. However
   and forever, the minimum wage increases have always been justified
   about "lifting hundreds or thousands out of poverty." Well, I think we
   all can agree that so far that's not worked.
   First, you get people fed and healthy, then help them with the roof
   over their head, then educate or train them in a skill...then put them
   to work. The idea is that they feel better about themselves and might
   even have a chance at happiness. Leaving out these steps, will only
   produce more of the same and that's just One problem with this 15 NOW.
   But we all know that's a daunting task and someone will have to grow
   some fairly big cojones to tackle all that AND tell corporations to go
   take a hike right our of our city ( all 5 or more of them). Problem is
   we can't find the big guys, cause they're hiding behind us little guys
   ( local independent businesses) and guess who is the easiest target and
   will be hurt the most? Yep.
   If you think its ok that small businesses get kicked to the curb, then
   what your really saying is that the city you'd rather live in looks
   more like a mall. If a little guy can't hang on to one shop( jobs lost)
   then there certainly won't be two, or three from him ( future jobs) oh,
   but better not grow our business anyway or we will be considered a
   corporation or big business and all of a sudden exploit our employees
   and steal from them. we should not be considered as we are now "rich"
   and have it to lose.
   I'm very concerned about our city, and hope that political agendas will
   take a back seat to reaching a solution that works for the majority. No
   doubt no one will get everything, but lets hope we walk away from this
   somewhat intact.

   @52: Your dire predictions of runaway inflation and net job losses is
   actually poorly sourced speculation oriented toward a singular outcome
   that sustains wages as they are.
   But I'll indulge you: what should we do instead? The system is clearly
   not working for large portions of some populations. As an opponent of a
   $15/hr wage, what do you think should be done? Now, keep in mind that
   many proponents are already working in various places on social justice
   initiatives beyond fair wages, so don't go crib off what they'd say.
   Tell me. In your own words. What would you do to mitigate the impact of
   a demonstrably harmful system that leaves thousands of people
   impoverished due to their ethnicity, national origin, religion, gender
   identity and sexual orientation? And if it helps you come to an answer,
   tell me if you think it's fair that a good portion of these populations
   should earn considerably less than $15/hr?

   But why ignore previous minimum wage increases, especially the

   by a greater amount than the current proposal? Why ignore the data in
   the op-ed written by the very researchers presenting to the symposium
   you plan on attending? Why ignore what history has told us about the
   minimum wage and economic prosperity? If you're a fan of history, as
   you say, surely you'd want to investigate these things with an open
   mind.
   The fact that you already called a $15 minimum unacceptable shows
   you're not being genuine. If you want to prove that $15 would
   irreparably damage Seattle, you need to present evidence, not theory,
   not a gut feeling, not complaints about the working poor being unfair
   to you. If you want to have a debate, then let's do it.

   "Compare Costco to Walmart. Or Starbucks to McDonald's. Or Tom Douglas

   Why would we compare these? None of these are similar? And why do we
   keep bringing up Walmart that isn't even in Seattle?
   I'm sorry Mr. Hanaeur feels guilty about being born with a silver spoon
   in his mouth and never having to work in a minimum wage job and work
   his way up, or operate a retail or food service type establishment from
   the ground up. I'm sorry he feels guilty that he is making so much

   He is the 1%. He is untouchable. His wealth will never go away. This
   increase will mean absolutely nothing to him, his families, maybe his
   employees, but clearly he isn't terribly concerned with that or he
   would already be paying them a "living wage". So listening to him tell

   You do realize that while you might be happy making the same as the

   @61: Ah, but small businesses still profit from this situation. To say
   low wage workers must choose between small businesses and low wages or
   box stores and higher wages is a ridiculous proposition. It essentially
   says that low wage workers actually owe businesses of a certain size
   something out of this whole arrangement and that the real enemy is not
   the inequality but an oh-so-scary box store that might show up. It
   pretends that the burden of inequality must be shouldered for as long
   as possible until small businesses can be propped up high enough and
   then we can work on fixing the problem.
   You should review that wage increases have never once caught up to
   early- and mid-century inflation thanks to being stalled, watered down,
   carved out and made weak in the face of demands business made in
   various points from the wartime accord era. Hell, part of the impetus
   that urged Nixon to sign his minimum wage increase was anxiety over the
   war compounded by broad wage inequality. It really will take
   double-digit increases to catch up. That's raw economic fact.
   Next up, what in the world is this:

     First, you get people fed and healthy, then help them with the roof
     over their head, then educate or train them in a skill...then put
     them to work. The idea is that they feel better about themselves and
     might even have a chance at happiness. Leaving out these steps, will

     15 NOW. But we all know that's a daunting task and someone will have
     to grow some fairly big cojones to tackle all that AND tell
     corporations to go take a hike right our of our city

   I can't think of any rational activist who thinks we can leave social
   welfare behind in this whole thing. Addressing income inequality is a
   part -- a middling sized part -- of a broader initiative. And on top of
   that it's terribly condescending to say "well, take care of their needs
   and they'll feel better about themselves and it'll all work out". I've
   seen people in my tribe and other tribes, immigrants and people of
   color struggle through school with some help only to land on their
   faces when they're done because, even when they get help, there's
   always unseen things that obstruct and offend every effort certain
   people make to better themselves. So activists, the ones doing the
   work, aren't committing themselves to the limited cause of preventing
   harm to small businesses by hiding behind the genuinely oppressed.
   They're doing EVERYTHING THEY CAN to solve real problems.
   Finally, importantly: don't go waving your finger at activists by
   saying poor and underserved groups need to be made to feel happy first.
   I'm hella happy right now. I can look at statistics that say only 3/10
   people of Native American/Alaska Native descent that can even manage to
   be hired amid awkwardly high unemployment will even get a decent wage
   (I got my diploma, call me somebody!) and yet I still call my grandma,
   who was called "injun" and other even worse pejoratives to her face
   when she was out in the workforce, and we'll still laugh and have a
   good conversation because, hell, we're happy. So don't worry about
   that.

   "The only people who will finance this expansion are the middle class-
   workers and small business owners alike. There is not going to be a
   fresh influx of cash in the system which can alleviate that."
   Why don't more people realize this is the truth? 15now and Sawant have
   grossly oversimplified who gets to call themselves a "worker." If you
   started a business and hired some people, you are now either Corporate
   America or a Pawn of Corporate America...in their eyes.
   Many small businesses in Seattle have working owners. It's sad that The
   Stranger is supporting ideologues who have started with an arbitrary
   number, putting local, liberal, community-focused small businesses in
   the position of coming out against a minimum wage increase...when that
   goes against their values. $15 is just too high and January 1st, 2015
   is just too soon.
   Studies that have shown that tiny minimum wage increases succeeded
   really don't prove anything about the efficacy of a giant increase
   overnight, sorry. They just do not.
   Also, Sawant is right that Big Business is hiding behind small
   businesses on this issue. But she and 15now have set it up so that Big
   Business is the only winner of this situation. Small biz either fights
   this and wins concessions of some kind, or the minimum goes to $15, the
   small businesses go under and Big Business wins.
   If I were the CEO of a large retailer or restaurant chain I would write
   Sawant a campaign donation check right now.

   OK, then, If you don't like my examples, then you pick the examples.
   Which minimum wage increases would you like to study? Which states do

   increase will lead to disaster? And why haven't you done so yet? What

   But it does exist. And it has been raised many times. Please cite any
   of those times when it has led to harm.
   And what about Australia? The whole country is over $15/hr. Why hasn't

   I don't think big business is hiding at all. $15 Now is mad because
   they aren't getting a fight from the people they hate so much. They are
   mad because the REAL PEOPLE are getting in the way and showing them the
   real numbers of what damage this is going to cost to small employers,
   their employers, their landlords, their communities, their tax revenue,
   etc...
   Big business really doesn't care. This isn't their fight. They can
   absorb it. They will just raise the prices, adjust. And, while I know
   people believe it is really hard to find a job, it is actually really
   hard for an employer to find good people. This is going to leave a lot
   of options (potential employees) out there for them to pick and choose
   from. And as jobs will be more competitive in the city, they can also
   ask more of the people because their choices will be reduced.
   So, yeah, just a win-win for everyone. Money falling from the sky...
   right into the hands of the 1%. I guess they earned it.

   Raising the minimum wage is important but it must be done responsibly
   to make sure do unnecessary harm to our city and it's Social service
   Org's and local businesses. I read recently a quote by The Arc of King
   County ~ "funding for vital services is appropriated by the state
   Legislature, matched with federal Medicaid funds and allocated to hours
   of service. As a result, providers are limited in how much we can pay
   employees. We cannot simply raise prices to meet a new minimum wage."
   YES let's find a responsible way to raise the minimum wage without
   hurting our city and the identity we care so much about. We are being
   irresponsible by not getting all the facts and just advocating to raise
   the minim wage without asking the right questions.

   Glad your back. Tricky, tricky, tricky. Nothing up your sleeve right?
   Good misdirection. Drop a few letters here, add a few letters there.
   But I'm paying attention and so is the rest of Seattle. To clarify, I
   didn't call $15 minimum unacceptable, I said $15Now is unacceptable.
   And why don't I compare apples to pears? Because I actually want
   standards of living for the poorest in our city to improve, I'm not
   just looking for a quick win. I will not rely on old data from an
   economy 20 years ago+ to instruct me enough to tinker with peoples
   lives. Actual work has to be done before a remedy can emerge.
   Data? Where's the data? I'm dying to see it. All I see is a very biased
   analysis of a few data points. I am certainly not going to the
   Symposium to hear any "research" by Nick Hanauer and Eric Liu. I will
   look at the data from the real researchers myself and form my own
   opinion, thank you very much. I am a free thinker and I'll not be
   spoonfed.
   How can I claim that $15Now is unacceptable? Because The Seattle Human
   Services Coalition report from February indicated that an unintended
   consequence of such an ordinance would deny access to critical services
   to vulnerable, low income people. It is cruel to pit one low income
   group against another. And in my world, it is unacceptable.
   When I have the data, I certainly will present evidence to further
   illustrate what I know from my own personal realities. Like an
   avalanche. Because unlike the loudest voice in the room, I ask
   questions before I come up with an answer.

   Unless you know business, run one or studied p&l statements for a job,

   I think one of the best things that the $15Now campaign has and will do
   is motivate all of Seattle's supposedly progressive, supposedly
   compassionate small-business owners to actually put their energy where
   their high-minded mouths have been for the past several years. I mean,
   look at the responses from the $15Now "opponents" scrambling to figure
   out a way to raise their own employee's wages. I mean... it's not as
   though income inequality is a new issue, it just took a Socialist city
   council candidate igniting a grassroots efforts for an, admittedly
   somewhat hyperbolic, minimum wage initiative, to actually get these
   people to the table to craft actual policy to make something actually
   happen... instead of hearing them passively supporting the **idea** of
   addressing income inequality... you know... if it ever came up... you
   know, not that as a business owner I have any direct influence or stake
   in... you know, anyone's actual income.
   Don't get me wrong... I'm excited to hear what they come up with.
   Because I know that there are few things as effective as a motivate
   entrepreneur, especially when the business they've poured themselves
   into is potentially at stake. I also don't blame them for being a
   little bit scared or even crowing about fairness. They built their
   business to be successful in a specific clearly defined economic
   climate (albeit a horribly inequitable climate for the people who
   actually make their business run) and this $15Now would constitute a
   serious climate shift.
   Just don't expect much sympathies for the fact that the $15Now folks
   are forcing you to engage in helping craft a solution, since apparently
   that is what it took to bring your energies to the problem. It seems
   completely appropriate to me for Seattle’s small-business owners to be
   the ones busting their humps trying to figure out how to get to where a
   seeming majority of people in the city want to be (if we accept poll
   data that has been presented in previous articles that I am too lazy to
   look up and link to but I know they are out there) in a way that keeps
   their businesses viable.

   So, The Socialist Alternative is making Seattleites talk about things
   that we didn’t have the fortitude to face before Sawant arrived in our
   city -- or is it just small business owners that are all talk and no
   action? Wrong on all accounts. Socialists offer up a simple “solution”
   to problems prevalent everywhere in the U.S. Well, there is no simple
   solution. Socialists don't abide by capitalism as a rule. This is
   poison. We all know from injecting the Tea Party into Congress, that
   there is no value to electing representatives to our government who
   only want to dismantle the system.
   Sawant exploited the strong social justice ethics of Seattle citizens
   to get elected and is now dividing us politically instead of creating
   any kind of momentum where we can actually work towards solutions
   beyond the minimum wage.
   These are not the activists of Seattle, they take activism to a dark
   place. They are idealists. Idealists do not play well with others. The
   only answer to an unbalanced amount of idealism is pragmatism at every

   However, we aren't. We've already weathered a wage hike of roughly 80%
   in the past. The fact that it happened 20 years ago doesn't change the
   percentage - it's the size and speed of the increase that counts. Think
   about it another way. Does the historical distance from yourself to
   John Adams, your favorite founding father, render his actions obsolete?
   Obviously, the answer is no. A study of history gives us a context by
   which we can understand and measure modern events; you cannot simply
   dismiss what you dislike.
   You also ignore a rather prominent fact - SHSC actually supports a
   $15/hour minimum. To quote them directly, "SHSC fully supports raising
   the minimum wage for all human services workers (and others) to
   $15/hr." Does this change your opinion? Or were you originally lying
   and hoping no one would catch you?
   You do bring up a very valid point near the end - "personal realities."
   In your personal reality, this isn't a working class movement; this is
   some sort of political game. In your personal reality, you're out to
   protect the poor, instead of the status quo. In your personal reality,
   restaurant and bar payroll didn't increase by 21%, when, despite dire
   predictions of job loss and stagnation, Washington raised the statewide
   minimum, becoming the highest in the US.
   Perhaps if you employed a little empathy, you'd find it easier to see
   outside yourself, to see what most of us already see. No matter how
   concerned for the poor you are, you must know that concern alone
   doesn't raise people out of poverty, and it certainly doesn't repair
   the economic injustices of the past.

   Yes. Historical distance matters very much because the cultural and
   economic climates change. The economic climate is even different today
   than it was in 2008. Historical data informs, but we need facts and
   prudent dialogue without condescension to give us robust legislation.
   Maybe you have come across some unsavory characters in your life, but I
   am not a liar, I do not want to win awards and I don't believe in

   And, just a reminder, I am not against $15. I am against $15Now.

   "It would be great for business."
   Sure, it stands to reason that if one puts more money into an
   environment, that that extra money will be spent...somewhere.
   The HUGE problem with this ill-considered and bias-led statement/belief
   is that for the businesses that will fall the victims to this new 60%
   increase in payroll expense (before we even talk about the increase in
   expense from a businesses purveyors, but we'll leave that relevant
   point to another day), there's absolutely no guarantee that if a
   business has to increase their prices by 25% in order to match the rise
   in costs, that they will get 25%+ more income in order to stay even. In
   fact, it's inane to even CONSIDER this to be any kind of reality out
   side of what someone will tell you to get you to believe them.
   Please keep in mind, Dear Fellow Citizens, that these people who wrote
   this are trying to convince you. They are whispering sweet nothings in
   your ear and seducing you with their saccharine promises.
   The problem? They are wrong. ANY businessperson worth $5 will tell you
   that THIS WILL NOT HAPPEN. I'll tell you that - hell, I just did. It
   won't happen. The most basic laws/rules of competition make such a
   statement to be laughable. To be hysterical. Well, they would be
   laughable and hysterical if their foolish argument if made a reality
   would not cost so many people their businesses and so many of their
   employees their jobs.
   BUT! The sad comedy of these two continues when they write, " this
   isn't a town like Dallas or New York that worships the super-wealthy
   and believes in trickle-down economics."
   Yes, we don't subscribe to "trickle-down economics", but NEITHER will
   we fall for your what I like to call 'Trickle Around Economics'.
   They're trying to sell you a talking point, a slogan - but we can't
   govern by talking points and sloganeering. WE need to make good choices
   with facts & reason, and so far we get just manipulative feel-good
   rhetoric.
   Funny how they will cite Tom Douglass restaurants as 'proof' that we
   Seattleites are better, but didn't Tom Douglas himself claim that he'd
   have to probably close a number of his restaurants and increase his
   prices? But, that's the rub, 'eh? To quote Caddyshack, 'The world needs
   ditchdiggers, too.', and these people want to make you their ditch
   digger.
   The rest of this is the same balderdash. The same International
   Socialist nonsense. The same 'Trust Me' reasoning.
   If you want to trust someone, trust someone that owns a small business
   here in Seattle. Because, unless we're all liars, we're here to tell
   you that many of us will close if we have to go to $12.50, much less
   $15 which I GUARENTEE you will result in mass closings. Yes, I know,
   they'll tell you that this is just scare-mongering, but it's the truth.
   Don't let these people Wormtongue-like whisper those sweep promises in
   your ears. They are wrong, and their error will be your hardship.

   I'll keep this short and to the point.
   City government should not be writing payroll policy for private
   business.
   City government should stay out of the Human Resource arena for private
   business.
   Why?
   Once this single policy is voted up or down, they will move on and
   forget this entire issue.
   A simple vote on minimum wage doesn't make them business partners.
   When you take on the responsibility of payroll decisions you should be
   prepared to continue involvement with the businesses you are
   immediately impacting.

   Why would an entrepreneur ever start a business in Seattle? He or she
   could do better in Bellevue, Redmond, Factoria, Tacoma, Everett...
   where wage rages will be significantly lower.
   Think about this: A company with 10 minimum wage employees will have an
   increase of $120,00 per year in payroll. Do the math. $6 x 2000 hrs x
   10 people + $120,000. Most small businesses do not even earn $120,000.
   These businesses must close down or move out of Seattle.

   I think minimum wage agitators should come to the table with something

   So you want buying power to be the same? Then you would support a
   Federal minimum wage of over $11/hr to maintain the buying power
   workers -- even teenagers! -- had in 1968? And if you make Washington's
   minimum wage proportionate to that, you get at least $14.15 per hour.
   For the whole state. And if you account even a little for the higher
   costs in Seattle, you've got to be talking about at least $15/hr in
   Seattle.
   And that's just buying power. The loss of buying power that minimum
   wage workers have had in the last 40 years is what we're trying to fix.
   It doesn't even account for the increase in worker productivity that
   would put wages at over $22/hr. Which you can't say is only due to
   computers; it that were true, US productivity wouldn't be so much
   higher than Europe.
   I like your focus on purchasing power though. It gets us to at least
   $14.15 per hour. So your quibbling over the last 85 cents, I take it?

   Because $15/hr has the support of 68% of Seattle voters and will pass
   in a landslide. The amount $15 was chosen because it fairly splits the
   difference between what the minimum used to be back when America had a
   middle class to speak of, and the current, much higher, hourly worker
   productivity.
   Are you thinking that after $15/hr passes, labor is just going to pack
   up and go home and not ask for anything more? Not likely. Going to
   $30/hr would certainly start to make a dent in the heinous wealth
   inequality in the country, but Rome wasn't built in a day.
   There's more to come.

   This is a crazy argument. If you modify it to "Someone who works

   I like that plan. But they already bought the 15now.org domain. Maybe
   next year we'll do 20Now.
   In real dollars, ordinary people in every town in America used to get
   $11/hr. The lowest, youngest, least educated. $11/hr. In little podunk
   one gas station towns in the middle of South Dakota they paid over $11.
   That's the country we used to live in.
   Yet $15/hr in an expensive city like Seattle sounds like pie in the
   sky? And the bottom line is that what it costs to live. Anything less
   and you're asking somebody else -- the government, the taxpayer, other
   workers -- to make up the difference. $15/hr removes untenable
   externalities from worker's real incomes.

   After corporate downsizing in his middle age, my dad bought a
   restaurant in Iowa. As a new small business owner, he soon found
   himself working 80 hours a week for what amounted to almost $3.75 an
   hour. Just over $15K/year, which went a lot further for a family of 6
   in 1980 than today, but not what he had envisioned.
   Labor costs were 35% of revenue.
   A 61% increase in pay - really closer to 65% once the employer match on
   Social Security taxes is also factored in - would have increased labor
   costs to more than 57% of revenue. That would have easily wiped out all
   of Dad's income - and a lot more.
   If Dad had faced that he could have shut down the business -
   eliminating 24-28 jobs, plus his. Or he could have raised prices 22% to
   accommodate the increase in labor costs while maintaining his own
   income. Probably even more, as it wasn't the kind of town that would
   absorb a 22% price increase for an option like eating out, so he would
   have had to get even more money out of fewer customers. Or have fewer
   employees for the lower volume of business.
   Of course, his hourly income would have been a lot lower than that of
   his lowest paid employee at that point.
   That was only one small business. Different businesses vary. But it's
   why I'm skeptical of those who minimize the impact this will have on
   businesses and prices.

   Exellent example above by madawa. That is how it plays out in real
   life. The money has to come from somewhere.
   Americans need to learn more about how business works. Businesses are
   nowhere near as profitable as many think. They are not sitting on piles
   of cash. They only make a nickel in profit for every $1 of sales, not
   50% as many think.
   How about the people who want to earn more go start their own small
   business, start their own restaurant, instead of asking others to give
   them more.

   And as an employer, if your business model depends on paying people so

   The restaurant business is tough, for sure. But there are a lot of rich
   people in this city, and they all like to eat out. There's huge demand.
   After the increase you could raise prices, just like a lot of
   businesses will, and remain competitive. Or, maybe your business model
   doesn't work even then, and you'll go under. The thing is, Seattle's
   workers can't wait around for every single person that wants to run a
   restaurant in this city can realize their dream. If you can't make it
   work, this isn't for you, too bad. Try something else. Not Seattle's

   @109 The rich people in town may not care if prices go up a lot. But
   there are a lot more folks in the middle in this town. Raising the
   minimum wage won't raise their wages, so a big increase in restaurant
   prices will mean those folks will eat out less. Or take their dining
   business to Bellevue or some other adjacent suburb. It's not like lower
   cost alternatives won't be conveniently available - Seattle is
   surrounded by alternatives. And there's no reason to conclude that the
   rich will suddenly eat out more in Seattle because the middle are
   eating out in Seattle less.
   Losing business to the suburbs makes it Seattle's problem.

   109@ your argument is terrible. In summary if costs go up and you cant
   operate as a business leave seattle. What then happens to in my case 70
   employees who have no job? You know the seattle worker who gets to look
   at the job ads at $15 per hour jobs being about as realistically
   attainable at their skill level as the majority of us getting a
   director job at amazon. Yes some would find work i acknowledge that(
   renton, everett, fed way). Its funny to me about how u suppose its a
   noble cause to raise costs on some minimum wage employers by 67 percent
   but find it an injustice when land lords do the same to their tenants
   and the tenants are forced to move. Point in case if your rent/mortgage
   went up by 60% would u a) leave b) get a second job ie; raise prices c)
   stay. Fyi the only people defending this against point of view are the
   small local business and big business is silent. Strangebed fellows you
   have their now15.

   I have a perverse observation against raising the minimum wage to $15.
   Hear me out: so (I agree) a great argument for a $15 minimum wage is
   that anything else than a "living wage" is really just taxpayer subsidy
   of corporate profits, a la Walmart, when the money those workers make
   is inadequate to free them from government assistance. HOWEVER...for
   people in King Co, WHEN a $15 minimum wage goes in effect, we will
   generate more federal tax receipts. We won't adjust our state tax
   receipts because -ha! - we don't have a state tax! So the net effect of
   raising the minimum wage here will actually be to ENABLE trickle-down
   confederate capitalism in other shitty-ass parts of the country, and
   federal spending on our corporate kleptocracy, shit the DOD wants,
   etc., all the while siphoning dollars from our beautiful, prosperous,
   enlightened enclave. I oppose the increase in wages to $15 unless it's
   a FEDERAL minimum, because I don't want to weaken the Pacific
   Northwest. Last, I support legislation that prohibits any business
   owner/CEO from making more than 100 times the lowest earner in the
   company. You're a shitty-ass CEO that wants to take home still more?
   Well, you better pay top janitorial wages too. Assholes.

   Why doesn't anyone ever bring up the fact that if we cut spending at
   the federal level people wouldn't have to be contributing to spend 100
   million on research studies on how to get people to buy more maple
   syrup done by a Senator or congressmans buddy or the fact that we spend
   90 k a Hellfire missel to kill children in a sovereign nation that were

   The dole dependent states of the former confederacy are the fastest

   population growth. Dallas/Houston/ San Antonio/Austin in Texas by the
   way are growing and providing much better than minimum wage jobs. Low
   taxes, rational regulation, business friendly government wins every
   time.
   BTW we in the former confederacy have a much lower dole dependency rate
   than the Northeast, West Coast or Midwest. People cannot wait to move
   here.
   Texas, Atlanta, Charlotte, Raleigh, Nashville even Louisiana with 5%
   unemployment are superior to Seattle in standard of living and upward

   @113 I'm not convinced that the 70 poverty wages you pay in order to
   run a business which is profitable only to you/your shareholders are a
   net positive, given that they help to drive the wage market down. The
   point of a higher minimum wage is that those $15 jobs will no longer be
   unobtainable to your employees. They will be the available minimum.
   And here's the difference between employers and renters: people who
   have capital or access to capital can make choices that determine
   market conditions. E.g. at the moment you can choose to pay poverty
   wages regardless of how profitable your business becomes. No one
   (legally) has to care. You also have the option to alter your business
   model and pay decent wages, but until it's legislated, why would you
   bother?
   This is the reason civilised societies temper market freedoms with
   protections for those who don't have the power that capital buys.

   119.
   Lets start off with I employ 70 people> not 70 poverty wages as a
   majority of my employee's make more then minimum wage(75% or more) nice
   assumption there. As for driving the wage market lower what would you
   suppose is more pure way of navigating the wage market for those
   ex-cons, non-english speaking & often low skilled workers then the
   current system.
   Your argument with Employers vs Renters totally missed the point. My
   point was that a 63% increase in cost( realizing here I am aware that
   its likely to be phased in) is an incredible increase in cost to
   absorb. Employers btw are renters not just homeowners as your biased
   narrative would imply & do not have access by in large to large sums of
   capital by in large.
   Food for thought: How does manufacturing fair in Seattle if they sell
   goods and services to a global market(ie;not the newly minted $15
   dollar Seattle consumers you speak of). Let me guess they should just
   leave right? and their workers just a casualty for a dignified ginned
   up moral cause.
   Renters have choices as well they could raise revenues(prices) by
   getting a 2nd/3rd job. Or get a roommate ect. But just like business
   owners they may choose to leave due to the burden of the new cost.
   Do you really care about folks about the folks at the bottom of ladder?
   Have you done anything lately about it. Or this an intellectual sim
   city conversation that tickles moral background.

   @120 Sorry I misunderstood, it was the way you described your workers
   ("70 workers... You know the seattle worker...") that made me think you
   were paying them all minimum wage.
   I have no idea what you mean about "a more pure way of navigating the
   market". This has nothing to do with how employees navigate the market.
   The state needs to provide basic wage protection for those people so
   that business owners don't exploit them. Simple.
   For you it is not a 63% increase in labor costs, is it? It's only that
   much for 25% or less of your workforce. Is that a make or break
   difference for you? I have no idea, but I do know that with the current
   system, once you get profitable enough that it's no longer make or
   break, there's nothing to stop you continuing to pay poverty wages. Do
   you think that's fair?
   Access to capital is generally what allows people to start in business.
   I'm not saying you're a billionaire, I'm just saying you very likely
   had that choice, and the majority of minimum wage workers do not.

   Lets see diner mo. If 15 is the new floor. The worker making $16 now is
   wanting $20. The $18 then wants $22 ect. So yes its a 63% increase in
   labor.
   I think its fair to pay minimum wage as you note for someone who would
   otherwise make nothing. But if Cost of living keeps going up as it has
   been for 30 years what makes you think $15 is going to cut it.
   "Minimum" means your skills dictate you get the minimum.But everyone
   across the board gets a wage bump.
   Looking deep down inside I want my employee's to live happy,prosperous
   lives.Which is why i pay more then minimum wage to the majority of
   them.But there is some very lowly skilled people I employ purely
   because of the minimum wage. So yes my business model should a needs to
   change as you pointed out. Once passed those lowly skilled people who
   make sense at 9.32 are gone @ 15. 70 now becomes likely 60 or 63. And
   guess what poverty doesnt come down abit.

   @122 It's really nice that you looked deep down inside and decided you
   wanted your workers to earn enough money to live on (except if they are
   ex-cons, non-English speaking or have low skills). I'm a bit unclear,
   though, about whether you hire those other people at poverty wages out
   of charity or whether you hire them because you have work to be done
   that helps to make your business profitable, and they do that work?
   Also unclear about whether you are going to respond to a higher minimum
   wage by a) closing shop and firing all 70 people (dramatic!) b) firing
   7-10 people whom you only hire at poverty wages for charitable purposes
   anyway and keeping everyone else's wages the same (not too much profit
   lost there), or c) raising all 70 workers' wages by 63% and hoping for
   the best (generous! but scary!). There's one more option you might not
   have thought of: d) raising your minimum wage earners to the new
   minimum (and keeping them on because they do work that you need),
   making smaller upward adjustments to next bottom tiers of your salary
   scale, and absorbing the costs through a combination of adjusted profit
   margins, adjusted prices and possibly expanded sales (if as predicted
   this helps stimulate the economy). Radical suggestion, but it is at
   least worth considering, isn't it?

   @110 The idea that people who live in Seattle will drive to Bellevue to
   eat dinner because of higher prices is laughable. The price of gas
   alone would cut into any savings, and also, people don't live in
   Seattle so they can drive to Bellevue or another suburb for dinner. No
   one drives to the suburbs for dinner, unless it is for another reason
   (family/friends, they are already out there on some other errand). The
   middle class values eating out enough that they'll still do plenty of
   it.
   Seattle's economy is thriving, and has no problem attracting people or
   business. A slight increase in restaurant and retail prices will have
   little if any effect on this.

   @113. Oh, so you are going to fire all 70 of your employees, most of
   whom already make more than minimum wage, and put yourself out of
   business, because of this increase? That's dramatic. If the minimum
   wage employees you hire are only out of a sense of charity, and not
   because you need them to do work needed for your business to continue,
   you could just fire them and your business would see no impact. Easy.
   And all of the minimum wage jobs in Seattle are going to disappear
   overnight, forcing restaurant workers, baristas, many hospital workers,
   cashiers, shelve stockers, janitorial workers, daycare and elder-care
   workers, and many others to go to the suburbs looking for work? Because
   Seattle, a city of 634,000, will have zero need for workers like this
   when the minimum wage increases? Sounds legit.

   If I remember correctly, it wasn't that long ago that those confederate

   But hey, go ahead and vote yourself that raise you feel so earnestly

   Diner Mo..
   We do agree on a few things.
   1. I will have to raise prices and test the market( not a threat just
   an economic reality)to see if customers are willing to pay them. I have
   tried it in the past when I expanded my labor force and their is an
   elasticity to demand even with a 1% increase.
   2. I will let certain people go who are underskilled (7 on the
   shortlist currently)for $15 and likely replace them with some automated
   equipment which doesnt make sense at 9.32@ 1120 hours per month but
   does 15@ 1120 hours per month.
   Do we agree that the idea of the "minimum wage" is to help poor workers
   make a better living?
   Will some of these workers get $15...yes!! Will some be laid off yes!!
   Will it cause inflation in cost of Goods yes!! Will the cost of living
   be more affordable in Seattle for the poor?
   After all San Francisco is often referenced as a great comparison for
   Minimum wage(27%)is the 2nd most expensive city in the United
   States.How many people making $15 could live in the confides of San
   Francisco or Seattle for that matter.
   No one btw has answered about what happens to Manufacturing in Seattle.
   Seriously? These type of business dont derive any economic benefit from
   more Seattle-lites having discretionary income. They often sell
   globally. So their costs go up and no offset..

   While 15 now is a good idea, it's doomed to fail. It's good to think
   that prices will not go up, but people are gonna want the same profit
   margin they have now, so prices are gonna follow the increase of wages.
   The people that make more than min wage now, when the min wage goes up,
   will their wage follow the $6 increase, or will it go up to 15 or if
   they make more than 15, stay the same?
   Min wage is for unskilled labor, and not something that should be long
   term. It's more for high school and beginning college kids. If you
   think it is suppose to be a livable wage, you are kidding yourself. If
   livable wage is $20 and you're making min wage, get a room mate or 2,
   that way you're splitting livable wage 3 ways (give or take a bit for
   food and stuff) so you can live of the current min wage.
   In all, if you raise the min wage, every thing else is going to go up
   to follow suit.
   The only way to even begin to fix the issue, is lower the cost of
   living. Living downtown in ANY major city is expensive, and if you
   think making min wage and living downtown is ever going to happen,
   dream on. As I said before, if you plan on LIVING off min wage for long
   term, you are gonna have to get roommates and live in the outskirts of
   the city, like Everett or further north. Instead of spending money
   debating this issue, spend the money in Schools or Public
   transportation so the people can get an education and get a higher
   paying job, or live in the cheaper areas and be able to commute to
   their job without having to pay for a car (gas, insurance...).

   Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn said, "even after
   the 80+% wage increase for tipped employees after I-518 in 1988. This
   $15 is only a 60% increase, smaller than in 1988, and it didn't cause a
   ripple"
   What Ph'nglui conveniently left out was after that increase Seattle's
   inflation dramatically increased and was well above the national
   average. Here are the CPI #'s for Seattle for 88' & the years after.
   88'-3.3 %, 89'-4.7%, 90'-7.4%, and 91'-5.8%, 92'-3.7%. The 3 years
   immediately after I-518 are the highest CPI increases in Seattle in the
   25 years since 88', when supposedly not a "ripple" was caused.
   I am not suggesting that the raise in wage was the only cause of this
   spike in inflation in Seattle, but to suggest that raising wages
   doesn't cause inflation is just ignorant. Unless of course you think
   the shareholders at Starbucks will take the extra costs out of their
   profits. (Not Likely) Or that the local coffee shop or bistro has such
   large margins they won't have to raise prices to remain profitable.

   A Post on Crosscut.com from a Nick Hanuer employee
   I worked at Pacific Coast Feather Company for over 3 years. I worked in
   a role that was lets say administrative and required a 4 COLLEGE
   degree. The pay was barely above the proposed minimum wage increase he
   is supporting. I find it funny that Mr. Hanauer wants to give someone
   flipping burgers a 200% raise increase. Yet his CEO instituted a wage
   freeze and laid off over 1/3 of his workforce from the Seattle
   corporate office over the past 2 years. This was after it was reported
   that the company had its highest profits in three years at last years
   corporate meeting which his brother Adrian attended. You might want to
   look in your own backyard before you start touting the benefits of
   raising the minimum wage sir quite honestly you come off as a moron. It
   seems that you don't have a clue whats happening to the company that
   built your family fortune. Or it could be that you just don't care or
   this is a jump point into some kind of political career. Pacific Coast
   Feather is KNOWN for underpaying its employee's just look at glass
   door. The people who worked and are currently working there didn't and

   Shifting money in the economy from producers to consumers in order to
   benefit producers is a poor argument. Redistributing wealth is always a
   bad idea. Having someone spend money on something they would not have
   done left to their own devices always leaves that person worse off. If
   I want to buy your pen for a dollar, because that's what it's worth to
   me, then I will gladly give you my dollar and you will give me your pen
   if you value the dollar more than the pen. If all of a sudden I'm
   forced to have to give more than a dollar, an amount that I would value
   more than the pen itself, then I would rather not buy the pen. I would
   be worse off. Anything that is done outside of free, voluntary exchange
   is always a con. It's quite simple, you do things voluntarily because
   you benefit from it. When you are coerced into doing something you are
   losing, or else you would not have to be coerced.

   More money in the hands of workers means more demand and more jobs. If
   raising the minimum wage cost the loss of jobs those lost jobs will be
   starvation wage jobs which replaced the living wage jobs large

   Short term corporate profits on the backs of low wage workers who can't

   communities. Time to protect our own. That takes setting a standard of
   decency in the work place.
   Thanks!

   I just looked in the Yellow Pages for the Walmarts in Seattle. And
   there are none! So the Walmart workers you are trying to help with this
   policy will see no effect to their wages. And as far as all the extra
   spending money that will enter our economy because of this - there is
   none! The money is already there and it's going to the small business
   owners profits. After $15 minimum wage goes into effect that money will
   just be transferred to the workers which means a net gain of zero for
   the economy from that money. The only gain will come in the form of the
   higher prices that everyone will have to pay for goods and services in
   Seattle. And another thing - the major benefit from this goes to the
   CITY OF SEATTLE GOVERNMENT in the form of all the additional Sales Tax
   they will collect from the higher prices we pay. And sadly, The Mayor's
   Advisory Committee on Income Inequality didn't even give the citizens a
   voice. Only businesses and Unions were represented there. They don't
   care about all of us Citizens who will have to live with the increased
   cost of living with no benefit. It's about enough to make me join the
   Republican party!

   Okay two thoughts. First Aggregate Demand is the main driver of
   inflationary pressure, beside that you can have devaluation of currency
   but since the USD is a national currency a city implementing a higher
   minimum wage does not have to worry about #2. It does however have to
   worry about aggregate demand in particular demand for housing.
   Second. Why stop at $15.00? Why not $20.00 or $25.00? Heck I know how
   to make it so Seattle is home to only the wealthiest people in the
   world, you make it $50.00 an hour!!! Viola problem solved no poverty.
   Now add this into the equation. WE HAVE EXPERIMENTAL DATA AS TO WHAT
   HAPPENS WITH MINIMUM WAGE VERSUS NO MINIMUM WAGE!!!
   It is in Europe. Look at France. Their minimum wage is $12.50 an hour.
   Their youth unemployment averages between 22% and 24%. In the USA at
   $7.25 it averages 12% to 14% and finally the economic powerhouse of
   Europe, Germany. Its minimum wage is... $0.00
   That is right Germany has no minimum wage. Their youth unemployment
   rate is... 8% on average.
   oh well whatever.

   The answer isn't to increase minimum wage by over 50% it's to give
   these people working minimum wage jobs the right tools, education and
   development programs to develop careers, not jobs. THAT is what makes
   our country great, a free enterprise and hard work. This article lacks
   data and true economic impact, the idea is great but not realistic and
   we'll thought out. I'd like to see if given the option, how many people
   working minimum wage jobs would take advantage of education programs to
   further their education/career advancement, with no constrains on
   childcare or other things holding these people back, and who just wants
   a higher wage. Give the people wanting to improve their education and
   career the tools and resources they need to do so, don't encour.age
   complacency with such a catch-all approach..
