The Excessively Networked VC Behind SherpaVentures

   Here’s what happens when you set out to profile Silicon Valley venture
   capitalist Shervin Pishevar.

   On Monday, July 7, Scooter Braun, Justin Bieber’s manager, calls at
   Pishevar’s request to attest that the Iranian-born entrepreneur has
   brought him several high-profile investment opportunities and had a
   hand in introducing him to his future wife. On Tuesday, DreamWorks
   Animation (DWA) Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Katzenberg rings to
   praise Pishevar as “a great networker” and says, “There is nobody more
   loyal.”

   On Wednesday, Elon Musk, founder of electric-car company Tesla Motors
   (TSLA), is on the phone recounting how the pair traveled to Cuba last
   year with Sean Penn and ended up negotiating (unsuccessfully) with the
   Castro government for the release of an American imprisoned there. On
   Thursday, it’s Edward Norton, who says Pishevar advised the actor and
   his wife on building their charitable-giving website, CrowdRise, and
   later persuaded Norton to make an investment in the booming
   ride-sharing startup Uber. Finally, on Friday, New Jersey junior
   Senator Cory Booker calls to explain how Pishevar has become a crucial
   link between Washington and Silicon Valley—bundling donations for
   President Obama’s reelection campaign and spearheading an effort to
   create a new kind of “startup visa” for foreign entrepreneurs. “There
   are guys that can write big checks, and there are guys that can bring
   people together to write checks,” Booker says. Pishevar “inspires
   people to give and does it in a way that is not icky.”

   Pishevar, in case it’s not already clear, is one of the most
   excessively networked guys in Silicon Valley. The former
   tech-entrepreneur-turned-investor has backed Uber, e-tailer Fab.com,
   and eyeglass purveyor Warby Parker, among other startups. Now he’s
   running his own venture capital firm, SherpaVentures, which has raised
   $154 million from a group of investors that includes Condé Nast and the
   private equity firm TPG Capital. In the process, he has turned himself
   into one of the most visible members of the California technology and
   media scene, frequently showing up onstage at tech conferences and
   backstage at Hollywood awards shows. When Obama met with a select group
   of technology executives last December to discuss revelations about
   National Security Agency surveillance, Pishevar was at the White House,
   standing Zelig-like next to tech luminaries, including Tim Cook and
   Marissa Mayer.

   Pishevar, 40, embodies a new kind of venture capitalist, bringing
   contacts and visibility to his startups in addition to—or perhaps
   instead of—operational or technical know-how. A tireless self-promoter
   who prefers a Los Angeles-style hug over a handshake, he’s based in
   fashionable San Francisco instead of the stuffy suburban enclave of
   Menlo Park, the traditional cradle of the VC industry. He’s also known
   for his public displays of enthusiasm: He once shaved the initials of
   several of his portfolio companies into his hair.

   His exuberance and ubiquity have come at a price, though. The gossip
   website Valleywag once referred to him as a “humble-bragging,
   attention-grabbing startup financier” and suggested he’s obsessed with
   being liked and famous. Pishevar admits that a rival investor once
   called him “a clown” to his face.

   SherpaVentures is Pishevar’s bid to graduate from angel investor into a
   full-fledged venture capitalist—and prove those naysayers wrong. He has
   teamed up with Scott Stanford, 44, the former managing director of
   Goldman Sachs’s (GS) global Internet investment banking division, and
   is targeting companies that, like Uber, operate at the intersection of
   the Web and the gritty physical world. SherpaVentures recently invested
   $25 million in Munchery, a San Francisco startup that cooks and
   delivers ready-to-eat meals.

   Pishevar’s route to Silicon Valley was circuitous. His father, a
   successful TV executive in Iran in the 1970s, fled the country when
   Pishevar was 5. The family followed two years later, settling in the
   Washington, D.C., area. After graduating from the University of
   California at Berkeley, Pishevar founded WebOS in 1997, a firm that
   created a computer-operating system tailored for the Internet. A decade
   later he started Social Gaming Network, a maker of iPhone apps. He sold
   both companies for modest gains and used his winnings to bet on the
   budding wave of tech companies. Pishevar joined the VC firm Menlo
   Ventures in 2012 for a two-year stint that was remarkable primarily
   because he steered the firm into Uber—an early bet that has since
   produced exponential returns. He has “an immigrant’s mentality,” says
   Douglas Carlisle, a Menlo managing director. “He’ll do whatever it
   takes to be successful.”

   At a tech conference in 2012, Pishevar met Stanford, who arranged
   Goldman’s investments in Facebook (FB) and Russian Internet giant
   Mail.Ru. With the earnestness that characterizes many of his
   proclamations, Pishevar says, “we fell in love with each other’s
   brains.” The pair acknowledges there’s already a flood of capital
   sloshing around Silicon Valley, but they think they can offer not just
   advice to founders but full access to their formidable connections in
   L.A. and Washington. “Very rarely is tech alone a sustainable
   competitive advantage,” Stanford says.

   Pishevar and Stanford also want to open up their networks to big
   companies in New York and Hollywood that covet a place at Silicon
   Valley’s movable feast. So they’ve created a separate firm running out
   of the same office, called SherpaFoundry. Its mission is to help
   corporations develop and in some cases spin off digital assets that may
   be undernourished inside their massive organizations. SherpaFoundry
   members pay regular dues and include EBay (EBAY), DreamWorks, and Condé
   Nast, says SherpaFoundry CEO Tina Sharkey, a high-tech veteran who ran
   BabyCenter, a Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) website for parents.

   Pishevar knows that to be taken seriously as an investor and adviser he
   needs to tidy his public image. Earlier this year, Stanford persuaded
   him to cease his prodigious postings on social media. Pishevar was
   averaging more than 13 tweets a day and in the process drawing flak for
   frequently posting pictures of the stars he hobnobs with, such as
   Bieber and Miley Cyrus. “I made the mistake of sharing too much,” he
   says.

   It’s unclear whether he can stay off social media for good, but
   Pishevar’s reputation, at least, looks to be improving. That guy who
   called him a clown? Pishevar says he recently e-mailed, asking for a
   job.

   The bottom line: Investors have committed $154 million to Shervin
   Pishevar’s new venture capital firm.
