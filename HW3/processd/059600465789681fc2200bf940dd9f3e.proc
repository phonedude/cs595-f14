Men’s Business-Suit Onesie

   Jesse Herzog explains his debut Think Tank concept:

   Welcome to a revolution in apparel for the modern gentleman. Imagine
   looking professional but feeling like you're in pajamas. Consider
   wearing a suit and a onesie at the same time. Welcome to the Suitsy.

   The Suitsy is a jacket connected to a shirt connected to pants. A
   zipper is hidden behind the shirt-button placket (with false buttons)
   and pants zipper. Fake shirt-cuff material extends from the end of the
   jacket sleeves to give the impression of a complete dress shirt worn
   underneath. It's as if a jumpsuit and a business suit had a lovechild.

   Let's change the world, one better-looking, more leisurely gentleman at
   a time!

   How does the Think Tank work?
     * Submit
       We receive a fantastic new design idea, maybe from someone just
       like you.
     * Vote
       If that idea shows promise,
       we let our fans decide if we should whip up a prototype.
     * Crowdfund
       Once enough people fund the prototype we turn it into a Betabrand
       product.
     * Production
       In a matter of weeks, there’s a brand-new clothing invention for
       sale on our site!
