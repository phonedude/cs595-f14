Turns out we still need Plaxo (or something like it)

   September 2, 2014 / joseph / 15 Comments

   Despite having helped build a startup 12 (!) years ago focused on
   keeping your address book up to date, despite the massive intervening
   adoption of smart phones and social networks, and despite being
   connected to an unusually tech-savvy cohort of friends and relatives,
   my address book is still a disastrous mess. Sound familiar? This
   thought always lingered in my head, but it confronted me full-force
   this weekend while my wife and I struggled in vain to produce an
   updated mailing list to announce the birth of our new son. We’d done
   this for our last child (sadly using a shared Google spreadsheet in
   absence of any more purpose-built tool), so we were only 2-3 years
   out-of-date, yet an astonishing 45% of the addresses of our friends and
   family needed updating, and the task was not easily achieved.

   This led me to ponder why this seemingly tractable problem remains so
   stubbornly unsolved, and what, if any, hope lies ahead.

The false saviors

   It’s hard to remember that when we started Plaxo in 2002, there was no
   iPhone, no Facebook, not even Friendster or Flickr. Our biggest
   opportunity was writing a Microsoft Outlook plugin. Since then, many
   people have said that the problem of out-of-date contact info would
   soon be a relic of the past. Smartphones would keep us seamlessly
   connected. Social network profiles would always contain our latest
   info. Number portability, Gmail, and mainstream messaging services
   would create long-lasting identifiers. The death of snail mail would
   obviate the need for physical addresses. And so on. We often worried
   about these trends, and in some sense they have each helped us get more
   connected, yet they clearly haven’t solved the core problem. Why not? A
   few reasons…

   Contact info still changes frequently (esp. in aggregate). As mentioned
   above, nearly half of the people we sent birth announcements to last
   time physically moved in the past 2-3 years. Now in our age range
   that’s probably more than usual (buying a first house, getting a new
   job, etc.), but it’s still staggeringly high. And it’s not just
   physical addresses. I’m constantly wondering “is this the right email
   address or cell phone number to use for so-and-so, or is it dead /
   rarely checked these days?” Ditto for “who do I know who still works at
   [insert company here]?” Even using circles in Google+, I’m often
   wondering “gee, is my Googlers circle still a safe place for
   Google-only discussions?” Even when the info hasn’t changed, I’m often
   unsure if it’s still current. And of course I keep meeting new people,
   many of whom I haven’t ever collected the relevant info for (even if
   they wouldn’t mind me having it).

   Social networks suck at contact info. As surprising as the staleness of
   our address list was, I was even more surprised how few of my contacts
   had their latest address in Google+, Facebook, or elsewhere online.
   Many of these people used to work at Plaxo, and all are online using
   social networks daily. Yet the info is either missing, stale, or not
   shared with me. Why? In theory, social networks subsumed Plaxo-like
   functionality, but in practice there are deep reasons why they fall
   short.
     * Contact info is buried. I have to click to someone’s profile, click
       to their about/contact tab, scroll down, and then hope their info
       is shared with me. When’s the last time you viewed your own “about”
       tab (let alone someone else’s contact info section)? It’s out of
       sight, out of mind. In fact, even my own home address was out of
       date on Google+ and Facebook until long after I moved. It’s just
       not something you naturally think about while checking your news
       feed.
     * You don’t want everyone to have your info. Even though most social
       networks provide a way for you to share personal contact info, most
       users don’t want all of their “friends” to have all of their
       personal details. I recall hearing back in the day as Facebook grew
       that more people were actually deleting their contact info because
       they were making more and more loose-tie friends who they didn’t
       feel comfortable sharing that info with. On Google+ you can (of
       course) use circles to finely control who sees your home info, and
       Facebook has since followed suit, but as my wife put it when I
       asked her today, “eew, I don’t want to put my home address on
       Facebook”. You have to trust the site itself, your ability to
       navigate their privacy controls (and keep them up-to-date as your
       life changes), and the site’s ability to honor your choices before
       you’ll use social networks to share sensitive info. For most
       people, that bar has not yet been met.
     * Oh, and that whole “data portability” thing. When I want to see if
       I have someone’s latest home address, where should I look? My
       address book? Only if I can pull in the info shared with me from
       social networks. Not surprisingly, Google+ syncs to Google
       Contacts, but everything else is still a walled garden. You have to
       go knock on all the doors. For every person you care about. Every
       time. Even though they chose to share it with you. Sound broken? I
       agree. But I guess we weren’t loud enough.

   Smartphones aren’t smart about contact info. Your smartphone address
   book does a good job of following you around from device to device and
   desktop to mobile. The only problem is that it is syncing garbage data.
   You’d think that using it to send and receive phone calls, text
   messages, emails, and looking up driving directions would make your
   address book fresher and more complete. But you’d be wrong. Chalk it up
   to app fragmentation and no one really trying hard to solve the problem
   in the first place, esp. at the OS level. Even at Google, the Gmail
   Contacts team is separate from the android “People app” team, and most
   OEMs bundle their own separate address book. Good luck.

   No one’s helping you scrounge. Another fascinating if infuriating
   aspect of my recent Labor Day labor to update our mailing list was how
   often I could find the addresses by scrounging through my email
   archives, text messages, and manually entered address book info. I’d
   even been to many of the homes I lacked addresses for! In the absence
   of a good contact info syncing solution, most people still solve the
   problem “out of band” via existing communication channels (“leaving
   now, btw what’s your address in SF?” “it’s 123 Fake St., see you
   soon!”). Yet nothing is helping you extract, save, and aggregate that
   info for the next time you need it. It’s still a painful, manual
   process that you need to “get good at”. And this is for close ties–not
   random acquaintances–so it’s surely just an “entropy” problem, not a
   “stalking” problem.

   The wisdom of crowds? Another trend I was sure would take off in the
   age of the cloud was some kind of solution for pooling contact info
   between families, friends, and organizations. At Plaxo we used to
   always have the problem, “Who’s got the cell phone for that new guy we
   just hired?” and the answer was always “someone in the room” (you just
   don’t know who in advance, and you have to ask them first). Many
   families still have a designated aunt who dutifully maintains the
   conglomerated birthday and holiday card list. And “hey Garret, remind
   me what Pete’s new address is?” still gets the job done in a pinch
   without offending. So why does each address book still start from
   scratch as if it were the only record of knowledge in the universe?

A new hope?

   In the years since leaving Plaxo to help start Google+, I’ve talked to
   nearly every “address book 2.0” startup that’s reared its head.
   Apparently I’ve got a reputation in the Valley for not being “over”
   this contact info problem. Many have offered clever twists, but none
   have fundamentally addressed the challenges above. And perhaps
   unsurprisingly, as a result, none have saved the world from its
   frustrating fragmentation. So why am I still eternally optimistic?
   Because it’s a real, mainstream problem, there’s no good reason people
   want fragmentation to persist, and increasingly smartphones do
   participate in the events that collect or verify contact info. Plus
   there’s still the cloud opportunity for making each other smarter. So
   how might such a solution emerge?

   When trying to solve any complex social problem, one good question to
   ask is, “What does the ideal solution state look like?” In the case of
   up-to-date contact info, I’d argue we still don’t know. You could say
   it’s everyone being on a single social network and using it perfectly,
   but is that ever going to be realistic? I’d say it’s more likely a mix
   of assisted sync and scrounge. In other words: help me collect
   whatever’s been shared with me via social networks or communication
   tools. And the place to do that is logically a smartphone (backed by a
   cloud-hosted account). Google or Apple are, in theory, in a great
   position to make progress on this, but I suspect it will be a startup
   that gets the job done, since it can be their sole focus and brand
   identity.

   Such a startup would have to embrace the messy reality I’ve outlined
   above and turn it into a strength. Use all the available APIs and other
   tricks to help me find the contact info that has been shared with me.
   Keep track of when it was last updated (don’t make me guess). Parse
   through all my emails and texts for stuff that looks like contact info.
   Use my phone’s location history to ask me whose house I just visited
   when it doesn’t look like a business. Remind me what email or phone
   number each contact last used, and let me easily ping them back if I
   need some updated info. Help me build custom lists for things like
   holiday or birth announcements, and use that as an opportunity to ask
   for updated info. And partner with sites like TinyPrints not only to
   send those cards but also to send change-of-address cards when I myself
   move (something you should also be able to detect using my phone). Once
   you start gaining traction helping individuals keep their address books
   up-to-date, add a layer to pool it with family, friends, and colleagues
   in a privacy-preserving way (e.g. an easy way to see who knows
   someone’s phone number, but you still have to ask them to share it with
   you).

   Is there enough here to build a successful business around? You be the
   judge. But is this still a real problem that real people still wish
   someone would solve? Abso-f*cking-lutely.

       I think one major issue is that synced and updated contacts is not
       perfectly achievable. The problem is that there really is not a
       huge motivation to keep the habit of updating your information on
       social networks with everyone. The platform should basically make
       it easy for people to politely decline and be discreet, and
       establish its own culture amongst its users. What would be needed
       is a standard on how would this information exchange is done.
       Someone should create a detailed RFP/spec sheet on how to get
       contact info from someone who knows that person, and make it real
       simple for developers to develop something around that API.
     * http://www.ouvre-boite.com Julien
       All of this is very true, but I’m still not sure it’s a “solvable”
       problem or at least that there is a much better solution than what
       we have today.
       To me, identities have facets and evolve over time very much. A
       “contact” is more and more a facet of an identity. It used to be
       that people had the same snail mail address their whole life, but
       our parents showed that this wasn’t true anymore. We also change
       our phone numbers, emails probably more often than what we
       initially expected (or at least more than telcos expected) and web
       identities (profiles on social networks) are even more ephemeral
       (at least in their usage).
       Of course, smart phones and social networks should have make all
       that much easier, but in practice, these are all walled gardens
       will *less* interrop…
       If I were to build a tool that helps me keep track of my contacts
       contact info, I’d probably build a search engine. Something in
       which I could type a name (or a list of names), which would crawl
       the web, and every possible data source in search of these things.
       It would also probably be able to “ping” whatever it finds (phone
       numbers, emails, social network clients) to check that they’re
       still valid.
       It would probably be some kind of “pull” method, rather than a
       sync!
       Aside from this, it’s good to see you blogging again :) Think about
       adding a http://subtome.com button to your site! instead of the
       Google button in the top left column which yields a 404.

       Hi Joseph, great article and I connect with you on all points. We
       are building the current generation Plaxo, if I may put it that
       way, for mobile phones: InTouchApp – with the goal to keep your
       phone book up to date. Check it out at http://intouchapp.com .
       Would love to chat with you (*sarang) on InTouch. Thanks.
     * http://fullcontact.com/blog Brad @ FullContact
       Hey Joseph – Thanks for the great article. You nail the problems on
       so many of the pain points that we’re working hard to solve with
       FullContact.
       What’s interesting about social networks, especially the walled
       garden ones, is that every one of them thinks that they’re the
       perfect solution while only making the problem harder to solve.
       You’re absolutely right that nobody knows what the “perfect”
       solution is yet. We’re embracing the points that you mentioned. We
       use a combination of APIs, contextual data and algorithms that
       we’ve built to keep your address book constantly up to date…and we
       let you know when updates happen.
       One huge difficulty that you point out is with mobile devices.
       Apple’s method has merit, but so does Google’s. Finding a way to
       work with both of them is an interesting challenge when it comes to
       offering a constant UX across devices.
       Thanks again for the article. We know that contacts are important,
       but it’s always reassuring to see that we’re solving a problem for
       real people and not just for ourselves.

       Good call, added! Spruced up my super old theme while I was at it.
       :) Lemme know if you have any more suggestions. I’m clearly rusty
       at this blogging thing. ;)
     * Randy Schmidt
       I was working on this problem a couple years ago but stopped
       because I didn’t think I could make money off of it.
       I was picturing an open format where everybody’s set of data would
       be comprised of their contact info (obviously), a subscriptions
       list (UUIDs of people this person wants to track), a subscribers
       list (UUIDs of people to notify when the info changes (via a
       provider)) and a block list (List of UUIDs to not notify when there
       is an update). If someone abuses it you can block them. That
       doesn’t prevent them from previously copying down your info but at
       least you could block them, change your phone number, then the rest
       get the update.
       Most people would use a provider (Facebook, Google+, FullContact?)
       to mask all the down and dirty stuff. The provider would insert
       your UUID and provider into the registry so that things that know
       your uuid can look up where to ask for your info (or who to update
       when your info changes). People could choose people-friendly
       identifiers (mine would be r38y) that when someone enters it is
       swapped for their UUID (machine friendly) and the UUID is used from
       then on.
       So the registry would have friendly name, uuid, and provider. If
       you choose to change providers, the new provider updates the
       provider name and other providers know where to find you.
       WHEW that is a lot… and probably doesn’t make any sense.
       Anywho, I think it is a problem we should be able to solve but may
       not because humans are involved.

       oomphlink was just released today for iOS. It tries to solve this
       very issue.
     * Rikk
       I get comments almost weekly: “You need to create a Plaxo 2.0, it’s
       still a major problem!” And, I have been tempted several times,
       mostly out of the frustration you experienced recently. I have come
       to a few conclusions:
       1. Six years was enough time to work on address book tech :-D,
       2. Don’t try to solve the Two-Way-Sync-With-Other-Contact-Services
       problem (its too frigging messy, difficult, and out of your
       control),
       3. Focus on a delightful mobile-first address book that imports
       from everywhere (active and passive) and syncs well between active
       users (the original Plaxo promise).
       I believe that Plaxo’s egalitarian principle to not be the source
       of truth was a ball and chain that hampered us severely (a natural
       reaction to the spam and privacy hysteria of the early 2000’s).
     * David Johnson
       I stopped using Plaxo when they stopped supporting their app that
       syncs with iPhone contacts. It just stopped working and, despite
       numerous complaints from users, they didn’t fix it. Unhappy.
     * Alexander Norman
       Couldn’t agree more. This is a problem worth solving and I believe
       some people are trying to solve it (I have been experimenting with
       Humin and Triggerfox). The problem is not only tech but a human
       habit/motivation problem. A small subset of people (like me) will
       proactively update their contacts in a few places that can be
       scraped (e.g. Facebook) for the information. Most people change
       phones/addresses and they push the information to a subset of close
       friends via an email and think that covers it. There is no place
       they naturally think of updating the information. Who ever cracks
       this problem will have to automatically figure out people’s contact
       information has changed or will have to make it a habit forming
       destination for people to update their contacts. (Post offices have
       done this for physical mail, many people will fill out a change of
       address card).
     * Marika Ersher
       This is an example of what I said in my post: “future is open and
       not based on platform apps”.
     * Michael
       Plaxo’s iPhone app has been fixed and is currently working very
       well.
     * Elena Girolamo
       Services as Fullcontact or oomphlink are not the future, because
       the are application for specific platforms. Future is open, so I
       like more services as GlipMe that allows using any mobile device.
       Using public APIs to retrieve people data is still without future.
       Who owns data is creating walls and gardens. Look at LinkedIn,
       Facebook, Google or Microsoft data: they permits to access less
       data every day.
       My 2 cents…
     * santoshgk
       Joseph
       Very interesting blog and discussion. I have two points to make –
       1) Let us understand why we need “Mailing Addresses” and why not
       just be happy with “email or cell phone”? – In most of the
       situations all “electronic” communication can happen through email
       or blog or texting. You need mailing addresses when there is an
       expectation to “Ship” products between two parties or physically
       visit each other. This is where Privacy becomes key. That’s the
       reason people don’t like to share mailing addresses while they are
       open about sharing email or cell phone. So any solution which wants
       to address this challenge needs to respect privacy / Permission.
       2) You are absolutely right, smart phones are more of “Contact
       Management” than “Address Management. – Any software or platform
       that wants to address this challenge, needs to have ability to
       leverage these contacts to do physical transactions (like shipping)
       without actually needing mailing addresses. Privacy still is
       important factor.
       I believe there is a solution which exists to address the
       “addresses” challenges. This is being developed by a startup named
       mapmyid.com There patented platform and services could be the
       solution you are envisioning. Very senior executives from Amazon,
       eBay, JPMC, VISA, Rackspace, Stanford and couple of ecomemrce
       platforms folks are supporting / working together to address the
       “addresses challenge”
       Their service “Ship2MyID” actually removes the need of addresses to
       do any physical transactions. “Ship any thing to any one without
       need of mailing addresses” What PayPal does to money, they do for
       Shipping.
       – All they need is receiver’s contact information (email, cell #,
       facebook , linkedin id)
       – Sender has the ability to buy from an ecommerce store and ship it
       to pretty much all of their contacts in cell phone (download ios
       app nextgencards.com which does exactly that)
       – Receiver has 100 % control on whom to receive from, where to
       receive and when to receive.
       – Addresses are never shared between both the parties.
       Check them out :)
     * santoshgk
       Btw if you folks do want to try nextgencards ios app.. please feel
       free to use my personal free code “loyal3009″ – NO credit cards, No
       payments and NO Mailing addresses :) A real card is printed,
       stamped and posted.. Happy weekend
