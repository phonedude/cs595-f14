A modern mapping tool for transit planners.

   One of the biggest limitations to the quality of transit is the tools
   that are used to plan it. Transitmix is here to change that.

About

   Transitmix is a web-based tool to help transit planners (both
   professional and armchair) draw routes more efficiently. It began its
   life as a hackathon project developed by fellows at Code for America in
   2014. Since its beta launch in June, Transitmix has been used to
   generate more than 125,000 bus lines and 40,000 new transit maps for
   more than 3,600 cities all over the world, all powered by open,
   standardized data.
