Apple patents sensor-packed health monitoring headphones with 'head gesture'
control

   By Mikey Campbell
   In one of the earliest pieces of evidence pointing to Apple's push into
   the fitness and health monitoring field, the U.S. Patent and Trademark
   Office on Tuesday granted the company a patent for a biometric
   headphone system that can sense a variety of metrics including
   temperature, heart rate and perspiration levels.

   Healthbuds [14.02.18-Healthbuds.jpg]

                                Source: USPTO

   Claiming priority over a provisional patent application filed for in
   2007, Apple's U.S. Patent No. 8,655,004 for a "Sports monitoring system
   for headphones, earbuds and/or headsets" proves the company has been
   investigating integrated activity monitors for at least six years.
   According to the patent, the fitness monitoring system is cleverly
   ensconced in a set of headphones, something users commonly wear to
   listen to music during workouts. By positioning the headset in or near
   the ear, the embedded activity sensor can pick up temperature,
   perspiration and heart rate data, among other metrics.
   In addition to skin-based readings, an accelerometer may also be
   incorporated into the earbud chassis to facilitate the collection of
   accurate movement data. Some embodiments call for multiple
   accelerometers, each corresponding to a different axis.

   Healthbuds [14.02.18-Healthbuds-4.jpg]

   As described, the activity sensor can be housed in the upper or lower
   portions of an earbud. As seen in the above illustration, an integrated
   solution would place the sensing apparatus wholly within the earbud
   frame. The solution would negate the need for users to wear or carry a
   separate piece of equipment, such as a smartwatch.
   Not detailed in the patent is the means by which heart rate,
   perspiration and other physical data is harvested. Apple has a number
   of other properties describing embedded electronic sensors that
   interact with a user's skin, including an invention covering cardiac
   signal collection as transferred by an iPhone's external metal
   structures.
   While mere speculation, Apple could potentially embed a conductive
   metal ring into the earbud, or perhaps position the activity sensor to
   facilitate touch with a user's bare skin. On the latter implementation,
   the patent points to a loop-style earbud that fixes the activity sensor
   in the boom arm rather than the headphone frame. Alternatively, the
   sensor may be a detachable component that fits into the earbud when
   needed.

   Healthbuds [14.02.18-Healthbuds-2.jpg]

   As the activity monitor also incorporates accelerometers, Apple
   proposes a novel means of hands-free navigation involving head
   gestures. For example, users can change music tracks and adjust volume
   by tilting or rotating their head in predefined manners. To avoid
   accidental activation, a priming procedure like a button press may be
   used to initiate the gesture sequence.
   In other embodiments, the activity sensor can be mounted within an
   inline housing on the headset cord. This implementation appears to be
   limited to motion data gathering, however, as no contact with the
   user's skin is noted.
   Apple points out that the headphone unit may be wired or wireless, with
   the latter leveraging Bluetooth connectivity to transfer data back to
   the host device like an iPhone.
   While the majority of the patent covers activity sensing, mention is
   made of a "psychological" sensor. It is possible that Apple could apply
   specialized algorithms information gathered by the built-in biometric
   sensor to create a general picture of a user's mental state. The
   feature could be something akin to Phyode's W/Me wrist-worn wellness
   device, which measures a user's autonomic nervous system via EKG
   electrodes.

   Healthbuds [14.02.18-Healthbuds-3.jpg]

   With rumors swirling over a so-called "iWatch," Apple has made a number
   of recent hires from the medical sensor and health industry, leading
   many to believe the company is working on a standalone monitoring
   device.
   Apple's sports monitoring headphone patent was first filed for in 2008
   and credits Christopher Prest and Quin C. Hoellwarth as its inventors.

   I just wish Apple would invent some headphones that wouldn't keep
   falling out of my ears.

   MEMs accelerometers are typically tri-axial, so, three axes in a single
   unit. A tri-axial gyro then gives an unambiguous rotational as opposed
   to mistaken translational signal, providing at least6 degrees of
   freedom.

   A special pair of health sensor packed headphones for the iPhone makes
   more sense than a special purpose watch product. I think there might
   have been medical headphones mentioned at CES this year too.

   Good idea from Apple. Increase the number and function of sensors in
   the things people already use instead of forcing them to adopt
   additional pieces of hardware.

   Looks like similar implications to this kickstarter:

   In-ear headphones is not for everyone. I'm using cheap earpod cushions
   to prevent them from falling out. Works great, but it bugs me that
   Apple didn't use a materialthat would preventit from falling out of
   virtually everyone's ears.

   I agree; those standard earphones fall out, and I hardly ever hear of
   someone using them. Supposedly the earphones, sound quality wise,
   aren't any good. Since you're using them, I guess this is way
   overstated(?)

   I think they sound dramatically better than every other ear pod I've
   tried. But without the cushion you won't be able to place them right,
   and the sound will not be directed into your ear the way it should -
   and you'll loose a lot of bass and volume.But with a cushion you can
   place them firmly in your ear and they'll sound great. I use them all
   the time.

   (edit: speaking about the ear pods, yeah?)

   Well, good to hear!
   (Yes, the standard ones that come with the iPod and iPhone, the pods
   that came with the iPhone 5 are different; untouched in my drawer)
