REVEALED: MPAA’s latest anti-piracy move accidentally, completely screws
Hollywood studios
       sirotabio By David Sirota
       On February 25, 2014

       From Marlon Brando’s civil rights statement in absentia to Michael
       Moore’s anti-war speech, the Academy Awards ceremony played host to
       its share of high-profile protests. This year, though, the biggest
       protest will likely happen outside the Dolby Theater.
       Pando has learned that visual effects industry workers plan a mass
       demonstration against the major studios’ ongoing efforts to
       offshore post production work. That offshoring has led to the slow
       collapse of the American FX industry at the very moment digital
       effects have become a central ingredient in entertainment products.
       The fight between the studios and the tech wizards who actually
       make movies possible is not new. Encouraged by ever-rising
       subsidies available overseas, the movie industry has for years been
       shipping millions of dollars of digital work outside the U.S. This
       kind of work is vulnerable to such offshoring because it can be
       done anywhere, even if logistics demand that much of the physical
       shooting remain in New York or Los Angeles.
       Up until now, there was little the American visual effects industry
       could do about this. With the studios bankrolling politicians and
       protecting their political agenda through the
       $60-million-a-year Motion Picture Association of America,
       Washington has refused to intervene on behalf of the workers.
       Unfortunately for the studios, however, Pando has also learned that
       the visual effects workers have just been handed a powerful new
       legal and political weapon, one with the potential to fundamentally
       change the economic dynamics throughout the entertainment and tech
       industries.
       And here’s the twist: It is a weapon the MPAA itself created in its
       own desperate attempt to prevent Internet piracy.
       The giant sucking sound coming from the tech sector
       Before getting to the case at hand, it is worth reviewing how
       thousands of digital artists, graphic designers, animators, and
       technicians in America’s visual effects industry became the latest
       casualties of an ongoing trade war — one that has already decimated
       domestic blue collar industries and is now turning the information
       sector into its newest battlefield.
       In 2006, Princeton economist Alan Blinder famously warned that the
       critical economic divide in the future will “be between those types
       of work that are easily deliverable through a wire or via wireless
       connections with little or no diminution in quality, and those that
       are not.”
       This truism has upended huge swaths of the tech sector, as
       everything from call centers to back office services have moved
       offshore to countries with lower wages, more lax labor protections,
       and more corporate-compliant politicians than here in the U.S.
       Meanwhile, the “wire” (read: Internet) has allowed the final
       products and services from that cheaper labor to be frictionlessly
       transmitted back to the American market with little degradation,
       thus boosting corporate profit margins.
       With many tech jobs subsequently moving from industrialized nations
       to more exploitable developing world economies, this was the
       digital version of the giant sucking sound that Ross Perot famously
       predicted.
       Offshoring wasn’t supposed to cause upheaval between advanced
       economies, because the wage and regulatory differentials in those
       economies were far smaller. There shouldn’t be many labor expenses
       for companies to reduce if they uproot from the United States to,
       say, Britain.
       These laws of “free trade” economics were supposed to provide at
       least some inherent job security for high-skill creative types like
       the roughly 9,000 people who the Bureau of Labor Statistics
       estimates work in motion-picture-related visual effects. Sure,
       those high-skill workers would still have to worry about some
       developing-world competitors who could offer studios cheaper labor,
       but they retained language and logistical advantages over those
       competitors. At the same time, those U.S. visual-effects workers
       were never supposed to have to worry about serious overhead-cost
       competition from other industrialized countries.
       That’s where governmental subsidies came along to distort the
       market. Violating the spirit, and the letter, of World Trade
       Organization regulations and U.S. domestic trade statutes,
       industrialized countries like Canada, Britain, Australia, Germany
       and New Zealand have started offering massive taxpayer-financed
       handouts to studios if the studios source their visual effects and
       post-production services in those nations. In British Columbia, for
       example, public subsidies pay up to 60 percent of the entire salary
       of visual effects workers. The United Kingdom and New Zealand have
       been following suit with recent efforts to further expand their own
       subsidies.
       This never-ending taxpayer-funded bailout has grossly distorted the
       global market for visual effects, artificially deflating studios’
       overall price for visual effects in the high-subsidy nations.
       The consequences in the United States have been predictable. As
       Pando previously reported, four decades after actor Charlton Heston
       urged Congress to “fight subsidy with subsidy,” U.S. states are now
       spending roughly $1.5 billion on their own subsidies to compete
       with one another for what US production work still remains. Even
       so, the states are increasingly unable to keep up in the
       never-ending international subsidy race (and they are typically
       losing money on the projects they do manage to attract).
       Consequently, as the Los Angeles Times reports, “At least a half a
       dozen visual effects houses have gone out of business in recent
       years as more work has fled to foreign countries, especially Canada
       and Britain, that offer generous tax breaks for postproduction
       work.”
       An upcoming documentary on the offshoring situation in Hollywood
       puts the number of firms lost at a whopping 21, including some of
       the industry’s highest profile companies.
       As The Verge reports:

     Rhythm & Hues — the creators of Life of Pi’s Oscar-winning visual
     effects — went bankrupt earlier this year… Digital Domain, who
     provided the VFX for Titanic and counted James Cameron among its
     founders, was declared bankrupt and sold in late 2012… (and) even
     DreamWorks (was) forced to lay off 350 employees earlier this year.”
     The Los Angeles Times notes that Rhythm & Hues executives
     specifically “cite the damaging effect of foreign subsidies that
     made it increasingly difficult for the company to bid on projects.
       Fast forward to the future, the Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts
       that even as visual effects-based content expands, job growth in
       the domestic visual effects industry “will be slowed by companies
       hiring animators and artists who work overseas” — specifically in
       countries that illegally subsidize their industry.
       The Visual Effects Society summed it up by saying “the amazing
       irony is that while 47 of the top 50 films of all time are visual
       effects driven and billions of dollars of profits are generated
       yearly, the actual people who create the work are becoming an
       endangered species in California.” Variety boiled it down to a
       simple headline: “Foreign Incentives Help Crush Once-Booming F/X
       Biz in U.S.”
       For those who have survived in the domestic industry, the situation
       is as bleak as it has been for so-called permatemp workers in the
       software industry.
       “Gone are the days of staff positions,” says Daniel Lay, a visual
       effects animator who runs the influential VFX Soldier blog that
       tracks industry trends. “If you aren’t on a project at the company
       you work for, you were laid off. Smaller companies have
       transitioned to offering no benefits and employee
       misclassification.”
       This has been a boon to the six major studios that the MPAA
       represents. According to the Hollywood Reporter, those giants
       “combined to generate more than $4.3 billion in operating profit in
       2013, up 23 percent from $3.5 billion in 2012.”
       The situation has also created an opaque financial market in which
       studios are trading tax incentives for up front cash through
       financial behemoths like U.S. Bank and Bank of America. It is a
       system that one critic calls a scheme “allow(ing) purchasing
       corporations to shelter income.”
       Forcing Big Government to confront Big Hollywood
       With political power players like the MPAA so invested in
       offshoring, the decimated visual-effects industry hasn’t had much
       recourse.
       Even though both WTO rules and U.S. domestic laws explicitly allow
       for severe financial punishments against governments that distort
       trade by strategically subsidizing industries, there’s a difference
       between those laws existing and governments enforcing them.
       Consider what happened back in 2007 when the U.S. Trade
       Representative opted to ignore a coalition of Hollywood unions
       petitioning the Bush administration to enforce existing
       anti-subsidy laws against Canada. When asked to justify that
       decision in a Freedom of Information Act request, the
       administration offered just four pages of heavily redacted
       documents. Since then, President Obama, whose campaigns have been
       financed by the big studios, has refused to reopen or reevaluate
       the case.
       Taken together, the message has been clear: presidents of both
       parties have been willing to use what discretion they have to
       defend the studios, regardless of the merits of the underlying
       legal argument.
       But that brings us to this drama’s surprise second act.
       The against-all-odds protagonist in this Hollywood sequel is Daniel
       Lay, the 33-year-old heretofore anonymous blogger behind the
       website “VFX Soldier,” which chronicles the tribulations of the
       visual effects industry. Lay, an animator who has worked for
       DreamWorks Animation, Sony Pictures Imageworks, and Digital Domain,
       enlisted the Washington law firm of Picard, Kentz and Rowe to
       explore whether there were legal options to fight the MPAA.
       In a twist that seems crafted by professional scriptwriters, they
       discovered a legal document submitted by the MPAA just two weeks
       ago, when the organization decided to weigh in on an seemingly
       inconsequential International Trade Commission case involving 3-D
       printers. In that filing, obtained by Pando, the MPAA argued that
       digital goods should be considered imports and therefore subject to
       the stringent copyright protections the big studios so desperately
       want.
       From the filing (emphasis mine):

     To effectuate Congressional intent to protect domestic industries,
     the Commission can and must construe the term “articles” to include
     imported electronic transmissions, consistent with its own precedent
     and decisions from other administrative agencies and courts.
     …The need to regulate the burgeoning international trade in digital
     intellectual property is widely recognized by U.S. policymakers. The
     U.S. government has consistently recognized that international trade
     in digital forms of intellectual property is every bit as “real” as
     trade in traditional manufactured goods.
     The use of electronic means to import into the United States
     infringing articles threatens important domestic industries such as
     the motion picture and software industries, as well as U.S.
     consumers and the government at all levels.
       In a statement to Pando, the MPAA proudly reiterated this position.
       “Congress has given the ITC broad authority to protect U.S.
       industries from unfair acts in importation,” said spokeswoman Kate
       Bedingfield, adding that if the government doesn’t recognize
       digital products as imports, “American businesses lose an important
       protection, which puts them at a significant international
       disadvantage.”
       On the face of it, that esoteric legal argument from the MPAA
       seemed unremarkable — since the failure of SOPA, the movie industry
       has tried everything it can to protect its bottom line. Yet, Lay’s
       lawyers soon realized that the MPAA’s legal position had enormous
       implications for offshored post-production workers.
       If, as the MPAA insists, movies should be recognized as imports
       then so too should post-production work. That means visual effects
       work would be subject to the same subsidy-busting provisions which
       previously were primarily applied to physical goods like steel and
       lumber.
       In other words, emboldened by the MPAA’s filing, the visual effects
       workers are now in a position to use the big studios’ own arguments
       to compel the government to slap trade tariffs on those studios’
       own productions in high-subsidy countries. Those arguments will be
       especially powerful because the MPAA made them to the very same
       governmental agencies that will process the visual-effects workers’
       case. Additionally, the workers can now take matters into their own
       hands.
       In a feasibility study prepared by Picard, Kentz and Rowe, the
       lawyers explained that workers don’t have to rely on the discretion
       of the U.S. Trade Representative. Instead, they could invoke
       an existing countervailing duty law which, according to the
       lawyers, is “mandatory in its application” and “does not grant the
       Administration discretion to decline” an action.
       Translated from legal-ese, this means the anti-subsidy laws are
       insulated from political interference, no matter how many friends
       in high places the MPAA has.
       If visual effects workers can show the Commerce Department
       and the U.S. International Trade Commission that an import is
       benefiting from foreign subsidies and therefore illegally
       undercutting a domestic industry, the federal government is
       obligated to automatically slap a punitive tax on that import. Such
       a tax would in practice erase the extra profit margins the studios
       are gleaning from the foreign subsidies, thereby leveling the
       competitive playing field for American workers and eliminating the
       purely economic incentive for the studios to engage in mass
       offshoring.
       With so much subsidy cash at stake, the MPAA will almost certainly
       try to prevent this. But here’s the thing: when the workers bring
       their case against the subsidies and the MPAA inevitably tries to
       fight them, the workers can now simply cite the MPAA’s own legal
       case and echo the MPAA’s own call “to protect U.S. industries from
       unfair acts in importation.”
       They can, in short, hoist the studios on the studios’ own legal
       petard.
       The wider implications for the tech economy
       With its own grounding in digital commerce, Silicon Valley has an
       obvious interest in how digital goods are classified. Underscoring
       that, Google has weighed in on the same obscure 3-D printing case,
       perhaps in an effort to legitimize its own current or future
       offshoring practices. In its filing obtained by Pando, the company
       insists that because “there is not a single mention of electronic
       transmissions” in the underlying trade law from 1922, it “appl(ies)
       to physical goods and not electronic transmissions.”
       Beyond the sheer insanity of implying that lawmakers 90 years ago
       deliberately excluded Internet communication from trade statutes,
       Google’s argument was debunked by the visual effects workers’
       lawyers, who outlined how government agencies like the U.S. Customs
       and Border Protection agency and the Court of International
       Trade (which oversees the ITC) routinely treat digital products as
       regular imports.
       As important, Google’s case was also legally eviscerated by — you
       guessed it! — the MPAA. In its review of legislative history, the
       MPAA ended up debunking the idea that digital goods are not
       imports. In the process, the MPAA further made the visual effects
       industry’s prospective case against the legality of the big
       studios’ own lucrative subsidies.
       David Yocis, a lawyer who has consulted with visual effects
       workers, says that the MPAA is caught between its two competing
       priorities, and that its legal filings prove it may finally be
       forced to choose between the two.
       “The MPAA is so worried about piracy they are not going to claim
       that on the Internet you can do anything that you want,” he said in
       an interview with Pando. “When push comes to shove, they are
       probably more concerned about preserving the ability of the
       government to crackdown on piracy than on preserving their
       subsidies.”
       Could political meddling still stop the law from being enforced?
       Despite the MPAA inadvertently exposing the big studios to severe
       trade sanctions, the domestic visual effects industry still faces
       serious obstacles in its legal crusade to end the subsidies and
       create an equal economic playing field.
       For instance, there is the sheer difficulty of organizing. Though
       Lay did manage to raise the money necessary to commission the
       feasibility study, and though a town hall meeting of VFX workers
       last year drew a huge crowd to discuss political strategies, the
       industry has no union. That will make it more logistically
       difficult — but certainly not impossible — to meet trade statutes’
       requirement to prove legitimate support for the case among the
       visual effects industry as a whole.
       Additionally, even though the statutes in question do not give the
       government the same discretion it used to quash earlier cases
       against Big Hollywood, there remains the potential for stealth
       political interference. After all, the Obama administration has
       close ties to the entertainment industry and the MPAA is one of the
       capital’s most powerful  lobbying groups.
       On top of that, the head of the Commerce Departments’ Trade
       Enforcement, Paul Piquado, is only a few degrees of separation from
       the big studios. He came to the Commerce Department from a plum
       position in the administration of Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell, who
       just so happens to one of the most reliable (and handsomely paid)
       allies of Universal Studios’ owner Comcast. Before that, Piquado
       cut his legal teeth at Sidley Austin, a law firm that has
       represented the MPAA.
       These connections and others probably could not alone stop the move
       by the visual effects workers. However, they could potentially slow
       down any final enforcement action to at least temporarily give the
       big studios the best of both worlds, aka copyright privileges under
       international trade laws without the attendant enforcement of
       anti-subsidy provisions under those same trade laws.
       For his part, Lay says that in this David-versus-Goliath battle fit
       for a Hollywood blockbuster, the workers’ new legal strategy has
       the best chance of success, and certainly better than trying to
       match other countries in an ever escalating race to increase
       subsidies.
       “We chose this route because it is the least political option for
       us, and we have very leftwing people and very rightwing people
       getting together to support this,” he told Pando in an interview
       between meeting with visual effects workers at Disney and
       organizing the upcoming Academy Awards protest. “My generation is
       very cynical about the system right now, and we’re trying to use
       the system as best as possible. What would it say about our system
       if it can’t be used in the way it is set up to be used?”
