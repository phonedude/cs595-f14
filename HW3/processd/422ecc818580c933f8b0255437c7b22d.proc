   How cutting government spending can increase the deficit
   Sometimes the market just won't allow deficit reduction
   By John Aziz | January 10, 2014


   Bernanke and Yellen have long warned of the drawbacks of too much
   deficit reduction.

   After the financial crisis of 2008, many countries faced deep
   recessions, soaring unemployment and massive private debt overhangs.
   Some countries — like the United States — responded with stimulus
   programs, pushing more money out into the economy in a bid to create
   jobs and put money in people's pockets.

   Other countries assumed that too much government borrowing would lead
   to rising interest rates. Furthermore, they fretted that racking up
   debt now would inevitably lead to higher taxes in the future to pay off
   that debt; so better to nip that problem in the bud, which would
   theoretically inject confidence — that magical, unquantifiable
   ingredient — into the economy.

   Britain was one of these countries, launching a deficit reduction plan
   in 2010 that featured spending cuts and tax hikes with the aim of a
   balanced budget by 2016.

   But contrary to what folksy politicians would have you believe,
   balancing a government budget isn't like trying to balance a household
   budget. It's not simply a matter of calculating money in and money out,
   because when the government cuts (or increases) spending it also cuts
   (or increases) the income of lots of people in the economy.

   So when Britain tried to enact its deficit-reduction policies, the
   growth in debt didn't slow nearly as much as intended. Indeed, debt
   climbed steeply to over 70 percent of GDP in 2013, from under 40
   percent of GDP in 2008. And even with much higher-than-intended
   borrowing, interest rates on government borrowing remained low,
   upending the original austerian argument.

   So what's going on here? Well the deficit is the sum of two things —
   spending and tax receipts. If spending is cut, the deficit will still
   increase if tax receipts fall by a larger amount. And cutting spending
   can itself cut tax receipts by lowering the income of consumers, which
   hurts their spending power, which in turn hurts businesses, which in
   turn lowers their profits, which in turn leads to decreased tax revenue
   for the government.

   In Britain, there was a big slump in tax receipts from 2010 to 2011 as
   the austerity began, which contributed to why Britain missed its
   deficit reduction targets.

   A more extreme example is Greece, which has been trying to fight its
   deficit since 2008. Unlike Britain and the U.S., Greece is part of the
   euro zone, meaning that its government does not borrow in its own
   currency, which creates the risk of not having enough money to pay off
   its debts. Because of this, Greece has been forced to cut its spending
   far more deeply than Britain, a policy which has come at the cost of
   over 25 percent unemployment and a massive downturn in the size of the
   economy.

   Greece has succeeded in reducing its 2013 spending to the level of its
   tax receipts in 2008. However, because tax receipts today are less than
   2008, Greece still has a large deficit.

   In other words, a weak market with falling tax receipts can force the
   government to push more money out into the economy than it takes in
   —even while the government is cutting spending like mad to fight the
   deficit. This is the market forcing the government into deficit
   spending.
