What's New In The Universe

   Direct Evidence Of Cosmic Inflation
   Alan Guth, Andrei Linde [3.17.14]
   Topic:
   UNIVERSE
   Introduction By: John Brockman

   Alan Guth, a charter member of the Reality Club, came to New York in
   1980, to give one of the first Reality Club talks. He presented his new
   theory on the early universe, which he had been working on for the past
   couple of years and had described earlier that year in a paper titled
   "The Inflationary Universe: A Possible Solution to the Horizon and
   Flatness Problems." It was a revolution in our understanding of the
   universe—a new theory that filled in the blanks left by earlier
   versions of the Big Bang theory. A few years later, Andrei
   Linde developed a version of Guth’s theory he refers to as Eternal
   Chaotic Inflation, which is now the most popular version of inflation.

   Some thirty years later, I'm sitting in a hotel in Vancouver reading
   the news about what might turn out to be the most important scientific
   discovery of my lifetime: a possible direct confirmation of Guth's
   ideas. Using a radio telescope at the South Pole, John M. Kovac and his
   team of astronomers were able to glimpse the very early
   universe—capturing traces of light from 13.8 billion years ago. If
   their data are accurate, Guth was right.

   Edge contributor and New York Times deputy science editor Dennis
   Overbye wrote about the developments in a story on the front page of
   Tuesday's New York Times: "...Inflation has been the workhorse of
   cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered
   whether it could ever be proved. ... If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work
   will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent discovery
   of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself.
   It would open vast realms of time and space and energy to science and
   speculation."

   How important is this development? MIT cosmologist Max Tegmark is
   quoted by Overbye as saying, "I think that if this stays true, it will
   go down as one of the greatest discoveries in the history of science."
   According to mathematical physicist Brian Greene, "If the results
   stand, they are a landmark discovery." Physicist Lawrence Krauss of
   Arizona State University, in a post on newyorker.com, wrote, "At rare
   moments in scientific history, a new window on the universe opens up
   that changes everything. Today was quite possibly such a day."

   But nothing is more prescient than Guth's own talks from two Edge
   Eastover Farm events, in 2001 ("A Golden Age of Cosmology") and 2002
   ("The Inflationary Universe"), and Linde's Edge interview in 2012 ("A
   Balloon Producing Balloons, Producing Balloons: a Big Fractal").

   A Golden Age of Cosmology (2001)

   Even though cosmology doesn't have that much to do with information, it
   certainly has a lot to do with revolution and phase transitions. In
   fact, it is connected to phase transitions in both the literal and the
   figurative sense of the phrase.

   It's often said — and I believe this saying was started by the late
   David Schramm — that today we are in a golden age of cosmology. That's
   really true. Cosmology at this present time is undergoing a transition
   from being a bunch of speculations to being a genuine branch of hard
   science, where theories can be developed and tested against precise
   observations. One of the most interesting areas of this is the
   prediction of the fluctuations, the non-uniformities, in the cosmic
   background radiation, an area that I've been heavily involved in. We
   think of this radiation as being the afterglow of the heat of the Big
   Bang. One of the remarkable features of the radiation is that it's
   uniform in all directions, to an accuracy of about one part in a
   hundred thousand, after you subtract the term that's related to the
   motion of the earth through the background radiation. [Continue... ]

   The Inflationary Universe (2002)

   Paul Steinhardt did a very good job of presenting the case for the
   cyclic universe. I'm going to describe the conventional consensus model
   upon which he was trying to say that the cyclic model is an
   improvement. I agree with what Paul said at the end of his talk about
   comparing these two models; it is yet to be seen which one works. But
   there are two grounds for comparing them. One is that in both cases the
   theory needs to be better developed. This is more true for the cyclic
   model, where one has the issue of what happens when branes collide. The
   cyclic theory could die when that problem finally gets solved
   definitively. Secondly, there is, of course, the observational
   comparison of the gravitational wave predictions of the two models.

   A brane is short for membrane, a term that comes out of string
   theories. String theories began purely as theories of strings, but when
   people began to study their dynamics more carefully, they discovered
   that for consistency it was not possible to have a theory which only
   discussed strings. Whereas a string is a one-dimensional object, the
   theory also had to include the possibility of membranes of various
   dimensions to make it consistent, which led to the notion of branes in
   general. The theory that Paul described in particular involves a
   four-dimensional space plus one time dimension, which he called the
   bulk. That four-dimensional space was sandwiched between two
   branes. [Continue... ]

   A Balloon Producing Balloons, Producing Balloons: a Big Fractal (2012)
   Let me start by saying that many, many years ago, and I mean like
   almost a century ago, Einstein came up with something called the
   "cosmological principle," which says that our universe must be
   homogenous and uniform. And for many years, people used this principle.
   In fact, it was formulated even much earlier, by Newton. The universe
   is still represented this way in current books on astrophysics, where
   you can find different versions of the cosmological principle.

   For a while this was the only way of answering the question, why the
   universe is everywhere the same. In fact, why it is the universe. So we
   did not think about the multiverse, we just wanted to explain why the
   world is so homogenous around us, why it is so big, why there are so
   many people, why parallel lines do not intercept. Which is, in fact,
   part of the same question: if the universe was tiny, like a small
   globe, and you draw parallel lines perpendicular to the equator of the
   globe, they would intersect at the south and the north poles. Why has
   nobody ever seen parallel lines intersecting? [Continue...]
