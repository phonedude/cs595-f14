The myth of the lone genius with the silver bullet

When seeking to tackle the world’s toughest challenges we still assume that a
lone genius will find a silver bullet and submit it to an idea suggestion box
online. We want this to be true, it makes a great story, but what if
virtually all great ideas were born through collaboration? And what if there
are fewer and fewer silver bullets out there?

   Most of us underestimate the extent to which the greatest human
   achievements have been attained through collaboration. We think of the
   lonely inventor, such as James Watt, often heralded as the father of
   the steam engine. We forget that Watt's success was a series of
   improvements to the Newcomen engine. In turn, Watt's steam engine
   powered much of the Industrial Revolution during which there was a
   spike in creativity like never before. This explosion of creativity
   stemmed from diverse citizens coming together in cities for the first
   time, to share inspiration and develop ideas together. One of the most
   creative periods in human history was born of collaboration.

   As the challenges we all face become more complex, we will become
   increasingly reliant on collaboration between different communities to
   seek and implement solutions.  We can no longer rely on the lone genius
   to find the silver bullet. Instead, we need to find ways for more
   diverse people to work together to develop ideas and test them in the
   real world.

   The good news is that we have a potential ally in technology. It can
   take the friction out of collaboration by alleviating the need for
   collocation, enabling us to communicate asynchronously and by making it
   viable for us to combine snippets of human creativity and potential
   that would have gone to waste in the past.

   With this in mind we launched a platform three years ago, called
   OpenIDEO, to solve challenges for social good. Over the subsequent 21
   challenges that we have hosted we have evolved a process and grown a
   community of over 50,000 participants. This week we are delighted to
   launch a challenge asking:

How might we make low-income urban areas safer and more empowering

for women and girls?

   Introducing OpenIDEO's Women's Safety Challenge from IDEO on Vimeo.

   To follow are seven aspects of our approach that we hope will empower
   our community, representing over 120 countries to help drive real
   impact:

   1) Radical transparency. The entire process will be open, including all
   contributions and comments. This will serve to reduce duplication of
   effort and will make all content searchable by everyone in the future.

   2) Don’t jump straight to ideas. We have learnt not to jump straight to
   ideas, instead we will start with a research phase. In this phase we
   will set missions designed to help build engagement with and
   understanding of the topic and to ask what has been tried and what’s
   successful – often there are existing solutions that simply need a
   light shone on them. We will also ask our community to share their own
   experiences, whether around security or analogous. The phase will give
   every community member an opportunity to participate and to build
   knowledge before we leap into coming up with new ideas.

   3) Defer to the experts, the people. We want our community’s ideas to
   be anchored in reality and will convene discussions with local
   communities in India and Nepal as well as partnering with local
   organisations and community groups to do the same across the globe.
   We'll be working on innovative ways to seek the insight and ideas of
   people who don't have access to the internet to make sure they are at
   the heart of the process. We want the whole process to be anchored in
   reality.

   4) Allow teams to coalesce. The site will allow teams to coalesce
   around ideas. The teams are meritocratic, groups coalesce based on the
   contributions of individuals, not their reputation or
   qualifications. We have learnt that teams achieve more through their
   diversity of skills and the social capital that glues them together.

   5) No prizes. Some challenges require prizes, for example the Ansari
   X-Prize that depended on significant investment to demonstrate
   progress. However, market based systems often collapse collaboration.
   Instead, we have tried to motivate the community to participate for
   many other reasons, including learning new skills, building a sense of
   community and achieving positive social impact.

   6) Solution agnostic. Although we will not give prizes for the best
   ideas, we may give grants to support teams to take ideas forward,
   whether they helped conceive the original idea or not. We will decide
   whether grants are appropriate and what size each should be based on
   the winning ideas and their unique needs. Too often a fixed approach to
   taking ideas forward creates a bias in the ideas that are submitted.

   Ultimately, this process will be as good or as bad as the community's
   contributions, enthusiasm and ambition. Please do get involved with the
   challenge by clicking here. This is the first of 10 challenges we will
   host with DfID and IDEO.org, we are keen to iterate and improve our
   approach so please also share feedback.
