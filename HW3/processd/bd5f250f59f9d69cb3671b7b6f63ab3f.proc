Greenhouse gas levels rising at fastest rate since 1984

   A surge in atmospheric CO2 saw levels of greenhouse gases reach record
   levels in 2013, according to new figures.

   Concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere between 2012 and
   2013 grew at their fastest rate since 1984.

   The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) says that it highlights the
   need for a global climate treaty.

   But the UK's energy secretary Ed Davey said that any such agreement
   might not contain legally binding emissions cuts, as has been
   previously envisaged.

   The WMO's annual Greenhouse Gas Bulletin doesn't measure emissions from
   power station smokestacks but instead records how much of the warming
   gases remain in the atmosphere after the complex interactions that take
   place between the air, the land and the oceans.

     It could be that the biosphere is at its limit but we cannot tell
     that at the moment”

   End Quote Oksana Tarasova WMO

   About half of all emissions are taken up by the seas, trees and living
   things.

   According to the bulletin, the globally averaged amount of carbon
   dioxide in the atmosphere reached 396 parts per million (ppm) in 2013,
   an increase of almost 3ppm over the previous year.

   "The Greenhouse Gas Bulletin shows that, far from falling, the
   concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere actually increased
   last year at the fastest rate for nearly 30 years," said Michel
   Jarraud, secretary general of the WMO.

   "We must reverse this trend by cutting emissions of CO2 and other
   greenhouse gases across the board," he said.

   "We are running out of time."

   Atmospheric CO2 is now at 142% of the levels in 1750, before the start
   of the industrial revolution.

   However, global average temperatures have not risen in concert with the
   sustained growth in CO2, leading to many voices claiming that global
   warming has paused.

   "The climate system is not linear, it is not straightforward. It is not
   necessarily reflected in the temperature in the atmosphere, but if you
   look at the temperature profile in the ocean, the heat is going in the
   oceans," said Oksana Tarasova, chief of the atmospheric research
   division at the WMO.
   'More worrying'

   The bulletin suggests that in 2013, the increase in CO2 was due not
   only to increased emissions but also to a reduced carbon uptake by the
   Earth's biosphere.

   The scientists at the WMO are puzzled by this development. That last
   time there was a reduction in the biosphere's ability to absorb carbon
   was 1998, when there was extensive burning of biomass worldwide,
   coupled with El Nino conditions.

   "In 2013 there are no obvious impacts on the biosphere so it is more
   worrying," said Oksana Tarasova.

   "We don't understand if this is temporary or if it is a permanent
   state, and we are a bit worried about that."

   "It could be that the biosphere is at its limit but we cannot tell that
   at the moment."

   The WMO data indicates that between 1990 and 2013 there was an 34%
   increase in the warming impact on the climate because carbon dioxide
   and other gases like methane and nitrous oxide survive for such a long
   time in the atmosphere.
   mauna loa Among the network used by WMO is the Mauna Loa atmospheric
   station in Hawaii

   For the first time, the bulletin includes data on the acidification of
   the seas caused by carbon dioxide.

   Every day, according to the WMO, the oceans take up about 4kg of CO2
   per person. They believe the current rate of acidification is
   unprecedented over the last 300 million years.

   The evidence of the atmosphere and oceans underlines the need for
   urgent, concentrated political action to tackle the problem says Michel
   Jarraud.

   "We have the knowledge and we have the tools for action to try keep
   temperature increases within 2C to give our planet a chance and to give
   our children and grandchildren a future," he said.

   "Pleading ignorance can no longer be an excuse for not acting."
   Road to Paris

   The world's political leaders will gather in New York on 23 September
   for a special summit called by UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon.

   The hope is that this meeting will kick-start longstanding negotiations
   that aim to deliver a new international climate change by the end of
   2015.

   The exact legal nature of this agreement is still the subject of
   contentious debate.

   UK climate secretary Ed Davey has outlined the UK government's roadmap
   to an agreement set to be agreed in Paris at the end of next year.

   While stressing the need for that agreement to be "legally binding", Mr
   Davey explained that actual targets for emissions reductions may not be
   covered by that term.

   "We do believe that the foundations of the agreement have to be legally
   binding, so what that might be? That might be the rules. That might
   include the measurements, the monitoring and the verification and those
   sorts of things.

   "We would prefer the targets to be legally binding, we already have
   legally binding targets in the UK and we are trying to argue for more
   ambitious legally binding targets for the EU, but we recognise that
   other countries find that a little bit more challenging.

   "I think there's a lot of support for having something that is legally
   binding, it's just the extent of what is covered by that, is where the
   negotiations will be."

   Mr Davey stressed that a deal in Paris would not just help limit the
   impacts of global warming, it would kick-start a massive transition to
   low carbon energy production around the world.

       Unfortunately, AGW is the new religion. It has been hijacked by
       zealots who want to control others far more than they want to save
       the planet.
       If they truly wanted to save the world, then they would stop the
       lunacy of Bio fuel. How does burning Amazon rain forest to grow
       crops to make petrol use less CO2?
       Well, it doesn't but rational thinking went out the window long ago
       on this topic.

       My big bugbear is that in developed world we are looking to ban
       1600watt vacuum cleaners and in the BRICS or MINT countries one
       rotten ill maintained old car ALONE is churning out more pollution
       in a day than all the 1700 watt vacuum cleaners in the UK put
       together do in a year!!
       We continue to buy the cheap Chinese substitutes (for want of a
       better word) and therefore promote this activity.

       Our magnetosphere is weakening and has a huge whole in it. The
       north pole is shifting towards Siberia. Sinkholes,earthquake in
       chile knocked earths rotation,increase in volcanic activity and hit
       plenty of times past few years by meteorites. Don't take my word
       for it, use your keyboard and google the FACTS. Do all you can,
       it's all you can do. Anyway, i got hungry hippies to feed, peace
       love unity
