The revolution is not everywhere yetâ€”and thatâ€™s a challenge for global
development

   Posted on January 15, 2014 by Alicia Phillips Mandaville, Managing
   Director, Development Policy

   The start of a new year seems to prompt an awful lot of writing about
   how the data revolution will change everything—especially in the
   developing world. It will be bigger than the industrial revolution. It
   is already disruptive. And the applications and devices that humans can
   design to use this data are projected to reduce poverty, liberate
   people, halt the spread of disease, and alter the state-centric nature
   of the international system. The more disruptive the better! Vive la
   Révolution!

   It’s easy to get caught up in this, as (full disclosure) I am. The
   availability of machine-readable, comparable information is already
   changing people’s lives in very practical ways. Data has even become
   less nerdy and more exciting to talk about: We can refer to “a
   disruptive future,” and plenty of people think that future kind of
   looks like an iPhone. Using technical terms in everyday professional
   conversations is becoming the norm. But underneath the comfortable arm
   waving about this bright new future, there are some quiet places that
   have not seen this change.

   At a time where people are waxing eloquent about the power of big data
   to make consumer goods and services ever more tailored and ever more
   rapid, the world still lacks reliable, comparable country statistics on
   basic economic, governance and human development outcomes across much
   of the developing world. UNICEF estimates that one in three children
   have not been registered and therefore simply do not exist in
   statistical terms. Education outcomes are often estimated by models
   based on five-to-10-year-old data. As a proxy for accountable
   governance, budget transparency data covers only about half of the more
   than 190 countries in the world.

   And the closer you look, the more you find that even the data we have
   considered reliable has internal flaws that can make it hard to trust
   (see Mortan Jensen's controversial book Poor Numbers). Unlike “big
   data”—where the law of large numbers more or less evens out the errors
   of any individual data point—cross-country data comparisons are
   typically small enough that even a handful of inaccurate data points
   can alter the outcome.

   The first challenge here is obvious. If we want to realize the
   potential of the data revolution in the world’s poorest countries, we
   need more and better data. Period. And people are already both
   demanding it and trying to create it.

   But there is a second, less-visible challenge: ensuring that data is
   used responsibly. Foreign aid and foreign assistance are fields where
   much of the data we want to use is just beginning to be collected or
   fraught with challenges. But while development professionals grapple
   with how to work appropriately with some serious data gaps, we are
   surrounded by popular examples from other fields of how reliable big
   data can be: Nate Silver's 2012 election predictions, Target's
   marketing algorithms that can tell you are pregnant before you tell
   your friends and even a Brad Pitt movie about data—seriously! It can be
   tempting to think our world is the same—but it isn’t yet.

   So if we are using development data, how do we know we are using it
   responsibly for policy making and aid allocation? That's not an
   often-asked question, but I think it should be. Are there cross
   checking metrics? What would that even look like?! Is transparency the
   answer? When someone corrects a data error, how should decision makers
   react (à la the Reinhart and Rogoff data controversy)?

   Over this year, focusing on the responsible use of data is a theme I'll
   come back to again and again: things worth watching and learning from,
   characteristics of the responsible (and irresponsible!) use of
   development data and efforts to fill data gaps to enhance aid
   effectiveness. I hope others will too.
