   via Shutterstock </a>) (Image via Shutterstock )With the New Year the
   corporate lobbyists and the Obama administration are stepping up their
   drive for passage of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the new trade
   deal being negotiated in secret by the United States and eleven
   countries in the Pacific region. The key at the moment is Congressional
   approval of fast-track authority. This would give any agreement a
   straight up or down vote on an accelerated timetable.

   Fast-track authority would virtually guarantee passage since members
   would face intense pressure from corporate contributors and the media,
   in both the news and opinion sections, to support the deal. Failure to
   support a deal would mean that a member would be labeled a
   protectionist Neanderthal (name-calling is standard fare in Washington
   when pushing for trade deals) in addition to being badly under-funded
   in their re-election campaign.

   As has frequently been noted, the TPP is not really about trade. The
   tariff barriers and quotas between the TPP countries are already low in
   most cases. Rather the point of the deal is to put in place a structure
   of regulations that will be more friendly to the large corporations who
   are in many cases directly part of the negotiating process.

   The provisions in the agreement will overrule measures passed by
   national, state, and local legislative bodies, in effect stripping
   democratically elected officials of much of their authority. Since most
   of the text is still secret we can only speculate on what the final
   agreement will include.

   The leaked chapter on intellectual property indicated that it would
   likely mean sharply higher drug prices in many countries since the TPP
   would strengthen patents and related restrictions on selling drugs. The
   final agreement may limit the ability of governments to regulate
   fracking. In the United States, federal law prohibits state and local
   governments from requiring disclosure of the chemicals used in the
   fracking process. This makes it far more difficult to detect pollution
   of ground water and drinking water. The TPP may include a similar
   provision.

   It may also include restrictions on the ability of governments to
   regulate the financial sector. This could allow banks to skirt rules in
   Dodd-Frank or comparable financial reform bills approved by other
   countries.

   It is likely that many of the provisions in the final agreement would
   be highly unpopular if they were put up for a vote, but the whole point
   of getting the deal as a fast-tracked take it or leave it deal is to
   prevent individual provisions from ever being considered. And there
   will be enormous pressure to take it.

   That is what we saw with the full court press used to pass NAFTA. And
   twenty years later the media and the economics profession are still
   covering up on the impact of NAFTA in order to avoid embarrassment to
   the deal’s supporters. For example the Washington Post recently wrote
   about Mexico’s growing middle class which it attributed in part to
   NAFTA. This is in spite of the fact that Mexico had the second slowest
   growth on any country in Latin America since the passage of NAFTA.

   The Washington Post also bizarrely asserted in a 2007 editorial
   attacking presidential candidates for criticizing NAFTA that Mexico’s
   GDP had quadrupled since 1988. In fact, its growth was just 83 percent.

   The economics profession, or at least pillars such as the World Bank,
   has also been prepared to make up numbers to make it appear NAFTA was a
   success. On the tenth anniversary of NAFTA the World Bank published a
   report touting the benefits of NAFTA to both the United States and
   Mexico.

   One of the key claims in this report was that NAFTA had produced faster
   growth in Mexico, leading to a convergence in living standards between
   Mexico and the United States. It is easy to see that this was not true.
   According to IMF data, Mexico’s per capita GDP rose by 29.1 percent
   from 1993 to 2002, the last year in the study. By contrast, per capita
   GDP had risen by 44.2 percent in the United States over the same
   period.

   Typically we would expect that a developing country would have more
   rapid growth than a rich country like the United States, so it would
   not be clear whether any convergence was due to NAFTA or would have
   happened regardless. However since growth in the U.S. outpaced growth
   in Mexico there was no convergence to argue over, the gap in incomes
   became larger.

   Nonetheless, the World Bank’s report trumpeted the success of NAFTA,
   showing how it led to greater prosperity for Mexico. They used a
   mistaken analysis to get this result, which the Bank has refused to
   correct to this day.

   This is what the opponents of the TPP can expect to encounter. All the
   rules of objectivity that the media claim to respect will be thrown in
   the dustbin. The same applies to any norms of professional integrity in
   economics.

   Big money is at stake here and the big boys intend to get a win with
   TPP. Logic, numbers, and evidence face an uphill battle.
