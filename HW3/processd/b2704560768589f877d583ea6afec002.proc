Poll: Keep Obamacare, fix it, and shut up about&nbspit!

   by Joan McCarterFollow

   Wilbert Jones helps local residents sign up for the Affordable Care
   Act, widely referred to as
   Enough already with talking about Obamacare, 53 percent of America (and
   47 percent of Republicans!) says. Keep it, fix it and move on to other
   things, says 60 percent. That's according to the Kaiser Family
   Foundation poll for March.

   The poll shows the highest support KFF has yet found for the law, which
   still isn't a lot but has been trending consistently upwards:

     In March, 46 percent say they have an unfavorable view of the law
     (down 4 percentage points since January), while 38 percent say they
     have a favorable view (up 4 percentage points since January). The
     gap between unfavorable and favorable views is now eight percentage
     points, down from a recent high of 16 points in November and
     January.

   Despite it's overall underwater approval, however, the public is
   really, really ready to accept the law (10 percent) and wants Congress
   to work on fixing it (49 percent). The public, that is, except for the
   29 percent that Republicans are playing for.
   KFF poll results chart showing more of the public would like to see
   Congress keep the law in place and work to improve it (49 percent) or
   keep it as is (10 percent) rather than repeal it and replace it with a
   Republican-sponsored alternative (11 percent) or repeal it outright (18
   percent).
   Always problematic, though, is the percentage of uninsured people who
   aren't aware of the March 31 deadline to sign up (about 60 percent).
   Additionally, 50 percent say they aren't going to sign up, but the same
   rough percentage says that they aren't aware of Medicaid expansion and
   more than 40 percent aren't aware that there's financial assistance for
   low- and moderate-income people in the form of subsidies. The
   persistent lack of knowledge and understanding about the law among the
   uninsured shows just what an uphill battle the administration has had
   in getting the word out. If Democrats play their election cards right,
   and campaign on the positives of Obamacare, the election might be able
   to assist in getting the word out before enrollment opens again at the
   end of the year, and some of these folks might be captured then.

   Here's another nugget for Democrats to chew on in this election year:
   74 percent of all respondents support the Medicaid expansion in the
   law, including 69 percent of independents, and 64 percent of
   Republicans. Medicaid expansion is a salient issue in the red states
   this cycle. Democrats need to use it.

   More Tagging tips:

   A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for
   "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?

   Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become
   President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.

   If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election
   tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the
   office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both
   senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.

   Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely
   different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably
   not meaningful.

   ______________________________________________________________________

   Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: Civil Rights,
   Community, Congress, Culture, Economy, Education, Elections, Energy,
   Environment, Health Care, International, Labor, Law, Media, Meta,
   National Security, Science, Transportation, or White House. If your
   diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state (California,
   Texas, etc). Keep in mind, though, that there are many wonderful and
   important diaries that don't fit in any of these tags. Don't worry if
   yours doesn't.

   The GOP has beaten the ACA horse to death,  There are some problems
   with the act as with all new laws but rather than work together to fix
   it, the GOP keeps voting (symbolically) to repeal it when they have
   nothing to offer as a replacement.  They are so fixated on denying the
   President any significant victories that they will cut food stamps,
   limit unemployment insurance and deny Red State residents access to
   Medicare.  They always claim they are acting for the good of the
   country but, when one investigates who benefits from these actions, it
   is always the same small group of the ultra-wealthy.

   58% of republicans, and I'd guess a much larger percentage of
   republican primary voters, want the law repealed.  That's a lot of
   people, especially in red states.  Therefore, it's still a good play
   for the GOP to run against Obamacare in red states.

   Everywhere else, especially after they get nominated, it looks like
   they'd best shut up about it.

   It's all irrelevant, though.  The GOP is holding the House, regardless
   of what they or the Dems campaign on.  That horse has left the barn.
   This Senate will be decided by what typical midterm primary voters
   think about the economy, Obama, and the general direction of the
   country, somewhere around Labor Day.

   It's not going to be about Obamacare.  It's going to be about Obama,
   especially in red states.

       through my employer. Every year, they approve a new formulary for

       formulary and replaced with a different medication. There have been
       years when one of my meds was taken off formulary - only to be put
       back on the following year and the replacement med then taken off.
       It has nothing to do with a medical decision - it has everything to
       do with which pharmaceutical will offer the greatest discount to
       the plan. Most of the time, from a medical point of view, this
       hasn't been a problem - on a few occasions it has been - but, tough
       luck on me. In other words, it's not an ACA thing - this is
       standard health insurance MO and won't be resolved until we finally
       get single-payer (perhaps).

     If Democrats play their election cards right, and campaign on the
     positives of Obamacare ...

   I'll take any evidence at all that 4 years into the ACA---4
   years!---Democrats are finally taking ownership of the law. But the
   truth is there's very little of that, certainly not
   generally/nationally. Frankly, Dems are scared of GOPer-dominated media
   haterism and won't get out and take the risk.

   Textbooks will be written by how the Democratic party---and
   Obama---failed to understand the political significance of this piece
   of legislation. We could be wiping the floor with the GOP if Democrats
   had had even the slightest bit of long-term thinking a couple of years
   ago and owned the outcomes of the ACA. Maybe four years ago, lacking
   courage might have made some sense. I can't for the life of me imagine
   how any elected Dems still think that in 2014.

 ACA (0+ / 0-)
       chrississippi, I couldn't agree with you more.  Everything about
       how Obama and Dems handled the intro of this monumental piece of
       legislation was detrimental.  As a result, Dems not only have lost
       any chance of regaining the House majority, but are likely to lose
       the Senate as well.  If folks think nothing is moving in Congress
       now -- just wait until Repubs get full control in the November.
       You are absolutely right that common sense and long-term thinking,
       planning and presentation on the part of Dems re the ACA would have
       enabled them to wipe the floor with the Repubs!  And I, too, am
       stunned that even now there aren't enough Dems with backbone to
       advocate for the ACA.

   Dems need to unite is expressing that although there was a problem with
   the roll out, it was not too long ago that if you wanted some, or
   better, health care with the government's help, you'd need top spend a
   whole day at a Department of Social Services office. Just because we
   had trouble walking it to each person's computer and making it
   effortless does not imply it's "broken". It's fixed and working and
   dependable. There' lots of real evidence for that. Don't cosign the
   rights negativity. It is what it was meant to be. Try to persuade for
   some credit rather than co-sign the BS.

 Actually, one of the biggest problems with the (0+ / 0-)
       STFU meme, is that most people read it as 100% across the board,
       even when it's clearly stated that no one is telling anyone to shut
       up entirely.
       In this case, Shut Up means the GOP needs to snap their trap on two
       important key points.
       1. Stop saying it's an affront to democracy and it should be
       repealed - as the stupid R's continue to try and do.
       2. Stop saying that everyone hates it, and that it's costing
       everyone more money, when both things are false.
       The point is, until they shut up about their false assertions and
       partisan attempts to shut ACA down, no one is going to fix the
       things that are wrong with ACA - because they're too busy trying to
       throw the ocean out with the bathwater.

   stinks; they will be on the job for only 112 days this year, the word
   "fix," means too much work.

   Many of these Repugs love to talk about the "lazy" unemployed who'd
   rather eat gourmet on food stamps, and lounge about on unemployment,
   but don't think of themselves as:

   Taking a salary from the American public and not doing the people's
   work.  Instead many of them have spent the last five years in office in
   a concerted effort to make this president's every proposal for the good
   of the country and for its people either not to be voted on, or dumped
   in the trash.

   Why?  Because they don't care about what is good for their country,
   they are only working for the Roves, Kochs, and the fringe to skew the
   next election. It's getting more of the same obstructionists into
   public office and that's all.

          AlexDrew

   If the public doesn't want repeal but thinks the law needs to be
   improved, why won't Dems acknowledge this and offer progressive ways to
   improve upon the bill? That would include a public option, a Medicare
   buy-in, more price/rate controls, fixes to address the subsidy cliff,
   etc. Those won't pass, but you can at least campaign on them as serious
   policy measures that have future potential.

 the persistent lack of knowledge and understanding (1+ / 0-)

   Recommended by:
          Sherri in TX

   is a result of a never ending barrage of bullshit and misinformation
   which has been pumping out since even mere discussion of the law began.
   The corproate media won't clarify any of it. You could lay the whole
   thing out in probably 10 bullet points and make it easy to understand,
   if the media wasn't so committed to simply providing the corporate
   approved narrative and/or conservative talking points and frames with
   no regard for the truth. You could sum it up by saying "it imposes a
   handful of new regulations on the health insurance industry, and
   provides subsidies to people to help them afford insurance, with the
   goal of insuring everyone."

   Would it not be better to say that we want to "strengthen" Obamacare

   Republican's claims that the ACA is broken and needs to be repealed or
   replaced.

 I'm shocked to see the repeal/no replace numbers (0+ / 0-)

   I can't believe up to 30% (GOP) and even 23% of Independents think the
   old system was just dandy. That statistic shows you how many of us are
   insulated from the real world by employer-based plans. Pre-ACA, the
   minute you came out of that protective bubble, whether intentionally or
   unintentionally (layoff), you were a lot more vulnerable and a lot less
   insurable.  The list of pre-existing conditions was longer than most
   people think and, in spite of all the kerfuffle now about cancelled
   plans, that happened all the time to people, sometimes while they were
   in the middle of treatment!

   Many employers don't really want to be offering health insurance and
   would gladly get rid of that benefit. Aiding that decision is the GOP
   proposal to take away their tax break for doing that. When that
   happens, a lot more people will be dumped into the individual market,
   and then we'll see how much the "repeal don't replace" crowd likes the
   good-old Pre-ACA days.

   Unfortunately, this is what most of the anti-Obamacare people are

   are.
   I'd like to see these self-centered SOB's without THEIR health care
   insurance! They'd be whining and crying to beat the band.
   These dirtbags ought to be ashamed....SINCERELY ASHAMED.....for wanting
   to throw poor people under the bus even though they have their bread
   buttered on both sides.
   God, I hate rich arrogant people! The hatefulness, arrogance and greed

 no brainer (0+ / 0-)

   The ACA is not perfect, it I not the end, but the beginning of changes
   that are long overdue to a broken system. Personally, I would have
   preferred Medicare for all, with a private option for those who believe
   for profit big corporations are going to care more about their health
   than a no profit healthcare administrating administration.
   Anyone who has had surgery, been ill, or had a loved one dealing with
   an illness or surgical issue, then they are lying if they tell anyone
   that our system works great. Costs are insane, and if those profits are
   not going to the doctors as they claim, then big business is simply
   price gouging and screwing everyone in the process.
   My wife just had an outpatient surgery, four hours in the hospital
   before driving home, and the cost is over 200,000 dollars. Anyone who
   says that is justifiable is an absolute moron. Our system has been and
   continues to be broken, we need to take the ACA and build on it, fixing
   areas that need fixing, or better yet, go universal with the private
   option.

       I've been an advanced cancer patient for three years, and many of
       my treatments (including major surgery and a hospital stay) have
       been very expensive. But nowhere near that amount for any one day.

 speaking of healthcare (0+ / 0-)

   As we have this discussion, our veterans are suffering with the VA
   system, one that is admittedly overwhelmed and "buried in paperwork".
   Many veterans are waiting 6-9 months for their claims, and
   subsequently, they are not getting timely care. Our veterans deserve
   better; I started this petition, sign and share it if you agree, we can
   help them if we come together.
   Subject: Demand better and more timely care for our veterans.

   Hi,

   I created a petition to The United States House of Representatives, The
   United States Senate, and President Barack Obama which says:

   "The United States sends our veterans to war, and when our veterans
   return home with mental health issues, such as PTSD (post traumatic
   stress disorder), the government fails miserably in providing adequate
   and timely health services and compensation. From Vietnam to Iraq and
   Afghanistan,  our veterans deserve better.  Whatever resources are
   needed to streamline treatment, claims processing, and counseling, we
   need to demand that Congress provide emergency priority funding, giving
   our best to those who gave their best for us. "

   Will you sign this petition? Click here:

 Exception to the Rule. (0+ / 0-)

   As a supporter of the Heritage / Romney conceived and Obama implemented
   ACA  (because indeed, 'no one should go bankrupt due accident or
   illness) but also as one who would prefer a 'single-payer' system, I
   would like to point out that there are situations in which buying
   insurance under this law doesn't make economic sense.

   My wife and I have been retired for well over a decade and have been
   without insurance all that time (forced-retirement in pursuit of
   corporate profits being the subject for another post). 'Early' Social
   Security is our primary - almost our sole - income and in a normal
   year, we are near enough the 'poverty line' to pay no Federal income
   tax at all.

   When I looked into buying insurance in January I was encouraged - our
   low income meant we qualified for a substantial subsidy and we were
   looking forward to getting covered. So why didn't we end up with
   insurance? Two reasons...

   1) we are both 64 and will qualify for Medicare in just a few months
   and 2) my wife's car developed intermittent transmission problems which
   logically meant a 'one-time' dip into savings to replace it. The $17k
   taken from our IRA wiped out most, if not all, of the subsidies and
   paying on the order of $1400/mo when we've gone 13 years thus far
   without insurance just didn't make sense.

   We support the ACA and wish we could have been one of its success
   stories but in the end, we've decided to keep our fingers crossed a few
   more months and pay the $95 fine.

 The main thing seriously wrong with Obamacare. . . (0+ / 0-)

   I admit the program has bugs, but it is working. The Republicans have

   Six-Pack are glad when they get their ACA insurance.

   This is what we will have to run starting in September:

   "Do you want to keep your Obamacare? If you do, vote for the Democrats
   on the ballot. We care about you."

   Then we can appeal to Veterans by pointing out that the Republicans cut
   their health care and the benefits they were promised when the joined
   the military. It could be interesting. Think of all the Veterans and
   people now on the ACA. They vote too.

 In Tx. the Pres. gets blamed for no medicaid (0+ / 0-)

   expansion.

   I've heard several people who would need but are denied subsidies
   blaming the president for their plight.

   One is my neighbor across the street.

   When she started talking about how difficult and expensive it was to
   take her kids to the Dr., she blamed Obamacare.

   Of course I corrected her, and she didn't argue.

   What was sad though was the look on her face told me that was the first
   time she had heard the reason why she was not getting the help other
   people in states that are participating was because the Govr Perry
   refused the help.

   YES and hard as that is to believe, people here believe the President
   is getting the blame by the people most affected by the cruel and
   calculated decision by the state Government led by Queen Perry to not
   participate in the Medicaid expansion.
   They blame him instead of the Republicans responsible, because they are
   told little else by the local media.

   Instead of explanations as to why people are getting excluded our local
   paper here is replete with the make believe examples of Obamacare
   making people lose their insurance and bullshit like that.

   Such lies are then buttressed by a lot of teahadist comments that add
   fuel to the fire regarding Obamacare and how it's going to destroy the
   nation.

   The lies come so fast and thick that to break through with it requires
   a concerted effort to get the truth out, but from where I sit there is
   no effort per se.

   People who do find out the real story do so in the way I described by
   talking to someone who knows who informs them or while in the process
   of checking insurance in general.

   One reason the Republicans in Texas are so cocky is the media is wholly
   on their side and not only do their best to spread every Republican
   talking point/lie throughout the state, but also do so in the most
   confusing way possible, ensuring people like my neighbor who have
   little time to spare (single mom with 3 kids works full time) will
   never find enough time to sit down at a computer and sift through the
   bullshit to find out why it's so hard for her.

   One example of the local media's cynical duplicity is calling the law
   Obamacare when it's the bad news/lies, and calling it the AHA when it's
   the good news from states who did agree to the expansion.

   Get that, when the news is bad and there is a lot of it, mostly lies
   the blame is on Obamacare.

   When news stories report news that shows why it's really a vast
   improvement over what we had the credit goes to the AHA with nary a
   mention of the President.

   It's not only the working poor who are confused. A couple I know both
   of whom have college degrees and earn decent money also do not know the
   facts, and they aren't the teahadist who doesn't care about the facts.
   They are just people who assume what they are reading in the media is
   more or less correct so.

   The bottom line is a much greater effort has to be made to inform the
   people about the benefits of AHA and who is responsible for trying to
   help the nation and which party is responsible for trying to take it
   all back.

   Relying on the media in red states to do an honest job is to forfeit
   the race before you start.

   If no such effort is made, AHA could very well become the  albatross
   around the Democratic party's chances come Nov. 2014.

   There is still a lot of time to fix things, but from where I sit I
   don't see any effort whatsoever, and I should be finally.
