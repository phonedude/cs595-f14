Without Federal Support: Cities Step Up

   By Mauro Whiteman, College Journalism Scholar

   What will America’s cities look like in 2024? Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed,
   New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu, Bloomberg Associates Principal
   Janette Sadik-Khan, Brookings Institute Vice President Bruce Katz,
   Speck and Associates Principal Jeff Speck joined Atlantic
   CityLab Editor Sommer Mathis at the 2014 Aspen Ideas Festival to
   discuss the changing face of America’s cities.

   As leadership in Washington remains gridlocked by partisanship,
   municipal leaders are hard at work redesigning cities to attract
   vibrant, diverse communities and new economic opportunities. “The
   business community is tired of the dysfunction of the federal
   government,” Reed said.

   “I think cities feel like they’re on their own,” Landrieu said. “What
   we’re having to do to survive and to compete and to get better is we’re
   having to innovate, which is great in many ways.”

   Millennials are choosing urban environments with high walkability and
   the opportunity for innovation, meaning that cities have to compete to
   attract talented workers, Reed said. More than a quarter of
   19-year-olds have opted out of getting a driver’s license, Speck added.
   Cities are working with their existing assets — like streets — to make
   necessary transformations, Sadik-Khan said.

   Because of the expanded role of city-level leaders in national and
   international affairs, cities will be able to leverage their assets
   against existing multilateral institutions, Katz said. “The world’s
   evolving as a network of trading cities,” he said. “We’re going back to
   the Hanseatic League, essentially. We’re going back to the Silk Road. …
   This is the new reality.”

   “Ten more years of this kind of affirmative, positive energy emanating
   up from the ground, I think states and the national government are
   going to have to change,” Katz said.
