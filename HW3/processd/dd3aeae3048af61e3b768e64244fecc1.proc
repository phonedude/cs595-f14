The Idiots Guide to High Frequency Trading

   Posted on April 3, 2014

   First, let me say what you read here is going to be wrong in several
   ways.  HFT covers such a wide path of trading that different parties
   participate or are impacted in different ways. I wanted to put this out
   there as a starting point . Hopefully the comments will help further
   educate us all

   1.  Electronic trading is part of HFT, but not all electronic trading
   is high frequency trading.

   Trading equities and other financial instruments has been around for a
   long time.  it is Electronic Trading that has lead to far smaller
   spreads and lower actual trading costs from your broker.  Very often
   HFT companies take credit for reducing spreads. They did not.
   Electronic trading did.

   We all trade electronically now. It’s no big deal

   2. Speed is not a problem

   People like to look at the speed of trading as the problem. It is not.
   We have had a need for speed since the first stock quotes were
   communicated cross country via telegraph. The search for speed has been
   never ending. While i dont think co location and sub second trading
   adds value to the market, it does NOT create problems for the market

   3. There has always been a delta in speed of trading.

   From the days of the aforementioned telegraph to sub milisecond trading
   not everyone has traded at the same speed.  You may trade stocks on a
   100mbs broadband connection that is faster than your neighbors dial up
   connection. That delta in speed gives you faster information to news,
   information, research, getting quotes and getting your trades to your
   broker faster.

   The same applies to brokers, banks and HFT. THey compete to get the
   fastest possible speed. Again the speed is not a problem.

   4. So what has changed ? What is the problem

   What has changed is this. In the past people used their speed
   advantages to trade their own portfolios. They knew they had an
   advantage with faster information or placing of trades and they used it
   to buy and own stocks. If only for hours. That is acceptable. The
   market is very darwinian. If you were able to figure out how to
   leverage the speed to buy and sell stocks that you took ownership of ,
   more power to you. If you day traded  in 1999 because you could see
   movement in stocks faster than the guy on dial up, and you made money.
   More power to you.

   What changed is that the exchanges both delivered information faster to
   those who paid for the right AND ALSO gave them the ability via order
   types where the faster traders were guaranteed the right to jump in
   front of all those who were slower (Traders feel free to challenge me
   on this) . Not only that , they were able to use algorithms to see
   activity and/or directly see quotes from all those who were even
   milliseconds slower.

   With these changes the fastest players were now able to make money
   simply because they were the fastest traders.  They didn’t care what
   they traded. They realized they could make money on what is called
   Latency Arbitrage.  You make money by being the fastest and taking
   advantage of slower traders.

   It didn’t matter what exchanges the trades were on, or if they were
   across exchanges. If they were faster and were able to see or
   anticipate the slower trades they could profit from it.

   This is where the problems start.

   If you have the fastest access to information and the exchanges have
   given you incentives to jump in front of those users and make trades by
   paying you for any volume you create (maker/taker), then you can use
   that combination to make trades that you are pretty much GUARANTEED TO
   MAKE A PROFIT on.

   So basically, the fastest players, who have spent billions of dollars
   in aggregate to get the fastest possible access are using that speed to
   jump to the front of the trading line. They get to see , either
   directly or algorithmically the trades that are coming in to the
   market.

   When I say algorithmically, it means that firms are using their speed
   and their brainpower to take as many data points as they can use to
   predict what trades will happen next.  This isn’t easy to do.  It is
   very hard. It takes very smart people. If you create winning algorithms
   that can anticipate/predict what will happen in the next milliseconds
   in markets/equities, you will make millions of dollars a year.
   (Note:not all algorithms are bad.  Algorithms are just functions. What
   matters is what their intent is and how they are used)


   These algorithms take any number of data points to direct where and
   what to buy and sell and they do it as quickly as they can. Speed of
   processing is also an issue. To the point that there are specialty CPUs
   being used to process instruction sets.  In simple terms, as fast as we
   possibly can, if we think this is going to happen, then do that.

   The output of the algorithms , the This Then That creates the trade
   (again this is a simplification, im open to better examples) which
   creates a profit of  some relatively  small amount. When you do this
   millions of times a day, that totals up to real money . IMHO, this is
   the definition of High Frequency Trading.  Taking advantage of an
   advantage in speed and algorithmic processing to jump in front of
   trades from slower market participants  to create small guaranteed wins
   millions of times a day.  A High Frequency of Trades is required to
   make money.

   There in lies the problem. This is where the game is rigged.

   If you know that by getting to the front of the line  you are able to
   see or anticipate some material number of  the trades that are about to
   happen, you are GUARANTEED to make a profit.  What is the definition of
   a rigged market ? When you are guaranteed to make a profit.  In casino
   terms, the trader who owns the front of the line is the house. The
   house always wins.

   So when Michael Lewis and others talk about the stock market being
   rigged, this is what they are talking about.  You can’t say the ENTIRE
   stock market is rigged, but you can say that for those equities/indexs
   where HFT plays, the game is rigged so that the fastest,smart players
   are guaranteed to make money.


   6. Is this bad for individual investors ?

   If you buy and sell stocks, why should you care if someone takes
   advantage of their investment in speed to make a few pennies from you
   ?  You decide, but here is what you need to know:

   a. Billions of dollars has been spent to get to the front of the line.
    All of those traders who invested in speed and expensive algorithm
   writers need to get a return on their investment.  They do so by
   jumping in front of your trade and scalping just a little bit.  What
   would happen if they weren’t there ? There is a good chance that
   whatever profit they made by jumping in front of your trade would go to
   you or your broker/banker.

   b. If you trade in small stocks, this doesn’t impact small stock
   trades.  HFT doesn’t deal with low volume stocks. By definition they
   need to do a High Frequency of Trades. If the stocks you buy or sell
   don’t have volume (i dont know what the minimum amount of volume is),
   then they aren’t messing with your stocks

   c. Is this a problem of ethics to you and other investors ? If you
   believe that investors will turn away from the market because they feel
   that it is ethically wrong for any part of the market to offer a select
   few participants a guaranteed way to make money, then it could create
   significant out flows of investors cash which could impact your net
   worth. IMHO, this is why Schwab and other brokers that deal with retail
   investors are concerned. They could lose customers who think Schwab,
   etc can’t keep up with other brokers or are not routing their orders as
   efficiently as others.

   7.  Are There Systemic Risks That Result From All of This.

   The simple answer is that I personally believe that without question
   the answer is YES. Why ?

   If you know that a game is rigged AND that it is LEGAL to participate
   in this rigged game, would you do everything possible to participate if
   you could ?

   Of course you would.  But this isn’t a new phenomena.  The battle to
   capture all of this guaranteed money has been going on for several
   years now. And what has happened is very darwinian.  The smarter
   players have risen to the top. They are capturing much of the loot.  It
   truly is an arms race.  More speed gives you more slots at the front of
   the lines. So more money is being spent on speed.

   Money is also being spent on algorithms.  You need the best and
   brightest in order to write algorithms that make you money.  You also
   need to know how to influence markets in order to give your algorithms
   the best chance to succeed.  There is a problem in the markets known as
   quote stuffing. This is where HFT create quotes that are supposed to
   trick other algorithms , traders, investors into believing their is a
   true order available to be hit. In reality those are not real orders.
   They are decoys. Rather than letting anyone hit the order, because they
   are faster than everyone else, they can see your intent to hit the
   order or your reaction either directly or algorithmically to the quote
   and take action. And not only that, it creates such a huge volume of
   information flow that it makes it more expensive for everyone else to
   process that information, which in turn slows them down and puts them
   further at a disadvantage.

   IMHO, this isn’t fair.  It isn’t a real intent. At it’s heart it is a
   FRAUD ON THE MARKET.  There was never an intent to execute a trade. It
   is there merely to deceive.

   But Order Stuffing is not the only problem.

   Everyone in the HFT business wants to get to the front of the line.
   THey want that guaranteed money. In order to get there HFT not only
   uses speed, but they use algorithms and other tools (feel free to
   provide more info here HFT folks) to try to influence other algorithms.
    It takes a certain amount of arrogance to be good at HFT. If you think
   you can out think other HFT firms you are going to try to trick them
   into taking actions that cause their algorithms to not trade or to make
   bad trades. It’s analogous to great poker players vs the rest of us.

   What we don’t know is just how far afield HFT firms and their
   algorithms will go to get to the front of the line.  There is a  moral
   hazard involved.  Will they take risks knowing that if they fail they
   may lose their money but the results could also have systemic
   implications ?.  We saw what happened with the Flash Crash.  Is there
   any way we can prevent the same thing from happening again ? I don’t
   think so. Is it possible that something far worse could happen ? I have
   no idea.  And neither does anyone else

   It is this lack of ability to quantify risks that creates a huge cost
   for all of us.  Warren Buffet called derivatives weapons of mass
   destruction because he had and has no idea what the potential negative
   impact of a bad actor could be. The same problem applies with HFT. How
   do we pay for that risk ? And when ?

   When you have HFT algorithms fighting to get to the front of the line
   to get that guaranteed money , who knows to what extent they will take
   risks and what they impact will be not only on our US Equities Markets,
   but also currencies, foreign markets and ? ? ?

   What about what HFT players are doing right now outside of US markets ?
   All markets are correlated at some level.  Problems outside the US
   could create huge problems for us here.

   IMHO, there are real systemic issues at play.

   8. So Why are some of the Big Banks and  Funds not screaming bloody
   murder ?

   To use a black jack analogy , its because they know how to count cards.
    They have the resources to figure out how to match the fastest HFT
   firms in their trading speeds.  They can afford to buy the speed or
   they can partner with those that can.  They also have the brainpower to
   figure out generically how the algorithms work and where they are
   scalping their profits. By knowing this they can avoid it.  And because
   they have the brain power to figure this out, they can actually use HFT
   to their advantage from time to time.  Where they can see HFT at work,
   they can feed them trades which provides some real liquidity as opposed
   to volume.

   The next point of course is that if the big guys can do it , and the
   little guys can let the big guys manage their money , shouldn’t we all
   just shut up and work with them ? Of course not.  We shouldn’t have to
   invest with only the biggest firms to avoid some of the risks of HFT.
   We should be able to make our decisions as investors to work with those
   that give us the best support in making investments. Not those who have
   the best solution to outsmarting HFT.

   But more importantly, even the biggest and smartest of traders , those
   who can see and anticipate the HFT firms actions can’t account for the
   actions of bad actors. They can’t keep up with the arms race to get to
   the front of the line. Its not their core competency.  It is a problem
   for them, but they also know that by being able to deal with it better
   than their peers, it gives them a selling advantage. “We can deal with
   HFT no problem”.  So they aren’t screaming bloody murder.

   9. So My Conclusion ?

   IMHO, it’s not worth the risk.   I know why there is HFT. I just don’t
   see why we let it continue. It adds no value. But if it does continue,
   then we should require that all ALGORITHMIC players to register their
   Algorithms.  While I’m not a fan of the SEC, they do have smart players
   at their market structure group.  (the value of going to SEC Speaks :).
    While having copies of the algorithms locked up at the SEC wont
   prevent a market collapse/meltdown, at least we can reverse engineer it
   if it happens.

   I know this sounds stupid on its face. Reverse engineer a collapse ?
   But that may be a better solution than expecting the SEC to figure out
   how to regulate and pre empt a market crash

   10…FINAL FINAL THOUGHTS

   i wrote this in about 2 hours. Not because i thought it would be
   definitive or correct. I expect to get ABSOLUTELY CRUSHED on many
   points here. But there is so little knowledge and understanding of what
   is going on with HFT, that I believed that someone needed to start the
   conversation

    4. I noticed that many respondents, come up with frightening scenarios
       about imminent apocalyptic crashes precipitated by HFT malfeasance,
       dwarfing the Great Recession and “Flash crash”.
       They would be great screenplays for “Armageddon”-like movies, but I
       am sorry to inform you, that for many reasons they cannot happen
       any more, so tonight you can sleep little better.
       Most, if not all exchanges impose various breaks and limits on HFT
       transactions as follows:
       * Number of messages/sec: (ex. CME – 1,000 msgs/sec), all messages
       exceeding the limit are discarded by the exchange, if you reach the
       limit in 0.1 sec or 1 millisecond, for the remaining 0.9 sec or
       0.999 sec all your messages will be discarded by the exchange, and
       you will be for all practical purposes disconnected from the
       exchange unable to trade.
       In addition, if after reaching the limit, you continue to flood the
       exchange with messages during the remaining period when you should
       be idle, if it persists for a while, you will be unceremoniously
       disconnected from the exchange network and questioned by friendly
       folks from the exchange compliance office trying to find out what
       happened, was it an unintentional software or hardware error or was
       it more intentional?
       If this scenario happens frequently, you will be simply banned from
       trading on that exchange.
       That takes care of the denial of service type of abuse and
       frequently repeated fairy-tale scenario of HFT firms executing
       millions of trades per second.
       * Ratio of messages to trades: (ex. CME – 500 msgs/trade) forcing
       traders to trade, fines for exceeding the limit.
       It limits so-called quote-stuffing or spoofing, whereby you would
       send thousands of “fake” orders to pull the market in one direction
       and then suddenly cancel all these orders and reap ill-gotten
       rewards on the rebound.
       Regulators are also looking for that type of trading behavior, and
       if they find it, there are very bitter consequences.
       * Circuit breakers limiting price movement: very simple, the
       exchange computers monitor price movements for all traded
       instruments. If a particular instrument price changes by more than
       a specified percentage during specified time interval, the trading
       in that instrumented is simply suspended for a specified “cooling
       off” period, after which it is carefully restarted.
       For example + or – 10% price change in 30 min, trading is
       suspended.
       These limits assure that another “Flash crash” or worse is simply
       not possible to occur again, anyway not one caused by HFT.
       If the economy tanks or we have another Credit Default Swap
       precipitated bubble followed by losses of $8 trillion, then all
       bets are off, but please don’t blame it on HFT (by the way, Flash
       crash was not caused by HFT trading but by a “fat finger”, and its
       severity was exacerbated by the lack of Circuit breakers
       implemented as the result of it).
       Finally, I’d like to offer some interesting statistics.
       In 2012 entire HFT profits in US were $1.25bn and according to WSJ
       total 2013 HFT investment was $1.5bn.
       All that for facilitating estimated 50+% of all financial
       transactions worth tens of trillions of dollars.
       These numbers don’t even register as rounding errors as compared
       with other financial sectors or even individual companies, yet the
       public is in frenzy calling for burning HFT at the stake, fueled,
       by among others, the recent 60 Minutes program and book by Michael
       Lewis, both full of factual errors and conspiracy theories, as well
       as recent subpoenas of HFT trading companies by NYAG Mr.
       Schneiderman, who no doubt would like to get the recognition like
       his predecessors Mr. Spitzer and Major Giuliani.
       Wouldn’t you expect HFT to show enormous profits, at least matching
       the level of alleged abuses and world-wide hysteria, instead of
       paltry $1.25bn?
       I’ll let you draw your own conclusions.

    9. As one of the idiots on this topic, I hasten to offer a BIG “thank
       you” to Mark. His post is extremely helpful to me, and it has
       triggered a fabulous discussion during which a number of experts
       more or less confirmed most of his central points. Please allow
       this idiot to raise some questions/observations from the “peanut
       gallery”, addressing algo usage in general.
       1. Wouldn’t the algorithms tend to produce the same trading
       response, subject to some minor random variation, given the same
       set of values on their input variable’s? The classes of variables
       that are relevant and their pertinent ranges of variation are not
       terribly difficult to imagine. Also, among these variables the
       values often tend to make “recurrent tracks” across their ranges,
       rather than to continually move into brand new territory (earnings
       per share reports, e.g.) . This leads me to wonder whether “algo
       behavior” tends to set up certain recurrent price change patterns,
       certain kinds of short-term waves of price movement, for example.
       If so, might it not be profitable for individual traders to find
       out how to sense these patterns and capitalize upon them in their
       trading? For example, if my memory is correct going back to the 80s
       and 90s we might in those days have to wait weeks for a popular
       stock to move to certain ” deemed to be extreme” price levels and
       set up special buying or selling opportunity, whereas now we may
       have to wait only a few days or even one day to see such stocks
       move to deemed extremes (or by extreme amounts from heir initial
       positions).
       2. If we view a market crash as the result of contagion of fear
       within a crowd, and during the “reign of fear” the market might
       fall X% over a number of days, should we not expect that in future
       crashes it may well take minutes, rather than days, for a fall of
       X% to take place? (n other words, the Flash Crash may have been an
       isolated event; but the now prevailing technologies (widespread use
       of algos) imply that under the right set of fear triggers crashes
       of similar or greater magnitude should be expected. While algos do
       not feel fear, their software logics might often be such that a
       network of algos interacting could easily simulate intense fear
       contagion (self-reinforcing selling waves or massive withdrawal of
       bids) . Is this all nonsense?
       If not, the implications for the individual investor are enormous,
       I think. For example, we must intensify our usage of insurance
       positions via options.
       3. While I see that my trades are most likely handled internally by
       the broker, I feel uneasy about the apparent fact that time
       honoured principles and procedures in interpreting published price
       patterns may be becoming obsolete as a result of algo behaviour.

   11. IMHO there are few points that are being glossed over in the recent
       HFT discussion.
       1.  HFT supporters can often be heard taking credit for an increase
       in liquidity.  Which I believe is really more of an increase in
       volume as opposed to real liquidity, but even if I concede that
       true liquidity has increased, I wonder, was it really needed?  Has
       traditional electronic trading not created a sufficient opportunity
       to efficiently match real buyers and sellers?  Idk, but perhaps
       it’s worth discussing,
       2.  While one, two, or ten HFT firms and their latency arbitrage
       strategies existing in the market may have a negligible effect on
       market orders I wonder if we have reached a toxic level of
       participation.  Michael Lewis mentioned that over 99 percent of all
       open orders are sent in by HFT firms and that roughly 50% of all
       filled orders can be attributed to HFT.  Now I have no idea how
       accurate those stats truly are, but if they are even in the
       ballpark then I think we, as market participants, should be
       concerned about an overdose.
       3.  Mark mentions systemic risk to the global marketplace and I
       believe that therein lies the rub with regulation.  It’s impossible
       to determine if our current market environment is being propped up
       by millions of arbitrage capitalists or not.  If the last five
       years of “growth” has been synthetic, to what degree will the
       global markets be affected if our regulators remove HFT firms and
       their ilk from the exchanges?  I think the uncertainty around the
       answer is one reason we see such a subdued reaction across the
       board.
       Obviously there are several sides to this conversation and I’m
       simply following Mark’s lead, hoping to extend the discourse.  Let
       me know your thoughts

       commented:
       For those that may not have the time to pick up Michael Lewis’ new
       book entitled “Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt” here is a fairly
       good high level introduction to high frequency trading by Mark
       Cuban. I also suggest reading Michael Lewis’ article in the NY
       Times entitled “The Wolf Hunters of Wall Street”
       http://nyti.ms/1iRYw3Y. It is a major issue that regulators have to
       tackle to restore confidence in the financial markets.

   16. http://edpalermo.com IMHO the way to counter this is through
       technology. It seems that IEX has found the answer to the speed
       advantage. Other exchanges can also follow their lead. I just don’t
       see how you police this properly, it is a cutting edge technology

   17. I know this is not the right blog to be posting this on. I also
       know that this will probably never be responeded to, but I don’t
       want to go through life wandering “what if”. I am a teacher that
       has just recently been let go due to the dwindling number of
       students at our school. I have a child on the way and am sitting on
       an idea that I have kept stored away until I had the courage to
       persue it. The idea will make a very large profit for anybody that
       invests in the initial start-up. Mark, if you do happen to stumble
       upon this, I would be more than happy to discuss the details with
       you. I have already been doing some research, and have not found
       anything like what I have to offer. This idea doesn’t focus on a
       specific demographic and will help people in HUGE ways across the
       USA. All I need is a partner that can help me get the whole thing
       up and running. I do have some people that are interested in the
       idea and are wanting to do lunch next week to discuss how to get it
       started, but I wanted to partner up with somebody that has
       experience in this field. Hope all is well MC! GO MAVS!

   19. Mark, good writeup to start the conversation. I largely agree,
       except the small guy is penalized. Most “small guys” have their
       money invested in the market via mutual funds. These vehicles
       process enormous bulk trades since they are representing a pool of
       assets. So although the small guy might not get whacked trading
       individual stocks… since the bulk of their wealth is in mutual
       funds and 401k plans, they are actually the ones that suffer from
       HFTs frontrunning their trades.
       SEC, your move.

   21. The stock market is structured in a way that allows the big guy to
       fleece the little guy. HFT is just another chapter in that story. I
       think it would be great if we could create a format and the
       regulations that would make the market more “fair” and give
       individual investors a fighting chance. But that seems really
       unlikely, due to the huge amounts of potential profit being made
       under the current system. And the fact that no matter what new laws
       you put in place, there will always be really smart and well
       financed people with a lot to gain by figuring out the loopholes.
       If you think of this as two competing sides, doesn’t the side with
       an unfair advantage have a lot more incentive (and financial
       muscle) than the side represented by the SEC and the individual
       investor?

   22. Great food for thought from streetwise professor.
       http://streetwiseprofessor.com/?p=8340
       “Pinging: Who is the Predator, and Who Is the Prey?”
       The debate over Lewis’s Flash Boys is generating more informed
       commentary than the book itself. One thing that is emerging in the
       debate is the identity of the main contending parties: HFT vs. the
       Buy Side, mainly big institutional traders.
       One of the criticisms of HFT is that it engages in various
       strategies to attempt to ferret out institutional order flows,
       which upsets the buy side. But the issue is not nearly so clearcut
       as the buy side would have you believe.
       The main issue is that not all institutional orders are alike. In
       particular, there is considerable variation in the informativeness
       of institutional order flow. Some (e.g., index fund order flow) is
       unlikely to be informed. Other order flow is more informed: some
       may even be informed by inside information.
       Informed order flow is toxic for market makers. They lose on
       average when trading against it. So they try to determine what
       order flow is informed, and what order flow isn’t.
       Informed order flow must hide in order to profit on its
       information. Informed order flow uses various strategies based on
       order types, order submission strategies, choice of trading venues,
       etc., to attempt to become indistinguishable from uninformed order
       flow. Uninformed order flow tries to devise in strategies to signal
       that it is indeed uninformed, but that encourages the informed
       traders to alter their strategies to mimic the uninformed.
       To the extent that market makers-be they humans or machines-can get
       signals about the informativeness of order flow, and in particular
       about undisclosed flow that may be hitting the market soon, they
       can adjust their quotes accordingly and mitigate adverse selection
       problems. The ability to adjust quotes quickly in response to
       information about pending informed orders allows them to quote
       narrower markets. By pinging dark pools or engage in other
       strategies that allow them to make inferences about latent informed
       order flow, HFT can enhance liquidity.
       Informed traders of course are furious at this. They hate being
       sniffed out and seeing prices change before their latent orders are
       executed. They excoriate “junk liquidity”-quotes that disappear
       before they can execute. Because the mitigation of adverse
       selection reduces the profits they generate from their information.
       It can be frustrating for uninformed institutional investors too,
       because to the extent that HFT can’t distinguish perfectly between
       uninformed and informed order flow, the uninformed will often see
       prices move against them before they trade too. This creates a
       commercial opportunity for new trading venues, dark pools, mainly,
       to devise ways to do a better way of screening out informed order
       flow.
       But even if uninformed order flow often finds quotes running away
       from them, their trading costs will be lower on average the better
       that market makers, including HFT, are able to detect more
       accurately impending informed orders. Pooling equilibria hurt the
       uninformed: separating equilibria help them. The opposite is true
       of informed traders. Market makers that can evaluate more
       accurately the informativeness of order flow induce more separation
       and less pooling.
       Ultimately, then, the driver of this dynamic is the informed
       traders. They may well be the true predators, and the uninformed
       (or lesser informed) and the market makers are their prey. The prey
       attempt to take measures to protect themselves, and ironically are
       often condemned for it: informed traders’ anger at market makers
       that anticipate their orders is no different that the anger of a
       cat that sees the mouse flee before it can pounce. The criticisms
       of both dark pools and HFT (and particularly HFT strategies that
       attempt to uncover information about trading interest and impending
       order flow) are prominent examples.
       The welfare impacts of all this are unknown, and likely unknowable.
       To the extent that HFT or dark pools reduce the returns to informed
       trading, there will be less investment in the collection of private
       information. Prices will be less informative, but trading will be
       less costly and risk allocation improved. The latter effects are
       beneficial, but hard to quantify. The benefits of more informative
       prices are impossible to quantify, and the social benefits of more
       informed prices may be larger, perhaps substantially so, than the
       private benefits, meaning that excessive resources are devoted to
       gathering private information.
       More informative prices can improve the allocation of capital. But
       not all improvements in price efficiency improve the allocation of
       capital by anything near the cost of acquiring the information that
       results in these improvements, or the costs imposed on uninformed
       traders due to adverse selection. For instance, developing
       information that permits a better forecast of a company’s next
       earnings report may have very little effect on the investment
       decisions of that company, or any other company. The company has
       the information already, and other companies for which this
       information may be valuable (e.g., firms in the same industry,
       competitors) are going to get it well within their normal decision
       making cycle. In this case, incurring costs to acquire the
       information is a pure waste. No decision is improved, risk
       allocation is impaired (because those trading for risk allocation
       reasons bear higher costs), and resources are consumed.
       In other words, it is impossible to know how the social benefits of
       private information about securities values relate to the private
       benefits. It is quite possible (and in my view, likely) that the
       private benefits exceed the social benefits. If so, traders who are
       able to uncover and anticipate informed trading and take measures
       that reduce the private returns to informed trading are enhancing
       welfare, even if prices are less informative as a result.
       I cannot see any way of evaluating the welfare effects of financial
       trading, and in particular informed trading. The social benefits
       (how do more informative prices improve the allocation of real
       resources) are impossible to quantify: they are often difficult
       even to identify, except in the most general way (“capital
       allocation is improved”). Unlike the trade for most goods and
       services, there is no reason to believe that social and private
       benefits align. My intuition-and it is no more than that-is that
       the bulk of informed trading is rent seeking, and a tax on the risk
       allocation functions of financial markets.
       It is therefore at least strongly arguable that the development of
       trading technologies that reduce the returns to informed trading
       are a good thing. To the extent that one of the charges against
       HFT-that it is better able to detect and anticipate (I will not say
       front-run) informed order flow-is true, that is a feature, not a
       bug.
       I don’t know and I am pretty sure nobody knows or even can know the
       answers to these questions. Which means that strongly moralistic
       treatments of HFT or any other financial market technology or
       structure that affects the returns to informed trading is theology,
       not economics/finance. Agnosticism is a defensible position.
       Certitude is not.

   23. Mr. Cuban if you can spare the time please help a blue collar guy
       understand ?
       Do stock markets benefit to society?
       If so how?
       (is this a place where need for capital is matched with investors?)
       Does HFT provide any benefit to those wishing to raise capital?
       Does HFT provide any benefit to investors?
       Does HFT provide any benefit to anyone other than the owner of the
       HFT system?
       Have I read comments by yourself to the effect that taxing trades
       not held for a certain time period would discourage this practice?
       Would not the money absorbed by HFT not be better (for society as a
       whole) invested in building businesses instead?

   25. The problem is not technology simpliciter.
       What frustrates me about this whole discussion is the fact that a
       lot of incorrect things are being said and certain facts are
       slightly adjusted where they become juicy fiction all to fit better
       in the fairy tale of the evil HFT firms rigging the market in
       conspiracy with the exchanges. Are all HFT honest participants with
       a fair market in their mind? No. Should they be closely monitored
       and should regulations adapt to their developments to ensure the
       market stays free and fair and stable? Absolutely. There are
       certainly risks in HFT that could affect the market (and economy!)
       as a whole (find me an HFT firm who denies this!). But a wise
       professor once told me “You should be against something for the
       RIGHT reasons”:
       First it’s obvious that jealousy should be avoided in a rational
       discussion of HFT. If you think the only thing wrong with HFT firms
       is that they make too much money, you should try to tax them more
       or change the rules of the markets to prevent them from making as
       much profit as they do (transaction tax?). Or perhaps you should
       start a HFT firm yourself, there are plenty of people who have
       enough money to start one, if successful the dividends tend to be
       high so investors should not be hard to find if your plans are
       sound. Hint: the biggest challenge is not having the money, but
       having the expertise and the human capital.
       The Alleged front-running: Front running in the strict sense of the
       word is highly illegal. If a broker gets a limit order from a
       customer, which she is free to manage on his behalf, it means that
       the broker is 100% sure her customer will buy/sell at that
       volume/price as that is what an order is (the probability of a
       customer not honouring his order is negligible). If the broker
       finds a better price, OTC or on the exchange, she should give that
       better price to her customer and only receive the agreed brokerage
       fee. If a broker buys/sells the product herself to then make money
       at the expense of her customer, she is front running and ripping of
       her customer and this is obviously illegal.
       The term front running in this discussion of HFT is abused. A HFT
       firm’s algo’s that trade on the public exchanges only have access
       to the public information available to everyone else and are only
       able to make trading decisions based on this public feed
       (nevertheless within 300 microseconds). Orders on exchanges can be
       cancelled at any time (again within 300 microseconds). There is no
       way to know the origin of an order on the exchange, in fact the
       only thing that is visible is the order book (how much volume at
       which price level). When the volume at a price level changes from
       100 to 105, it is very likely that someone sent in an order of
       volume 5 at that level, but there is no way to know whether this
       order is from any of the same persons that sent in the orders
       making up the initial 100 volume… The exchange operate at FIFO
       principle (first in, first out). No matter the origin of the order,
       if it arrives first at the exchange it will be the first one to be
       filled by a matching opposite order (buy vs sell). It is impossible
       to jump in front of an order once it has arrived at the exchange’s
       matching engine.
       In what way then can there be a perception/fear of front running by
       HFT? Due to the speed advantage and processing advantage (faster
       computers), and intelligence advantage (fast and clever algo’s),
       HFT firms are faster than other market participators to spot a
       movement of the market (due to ask and demand or otherwise) by
       interpreting the public feed. Say a HFT market maker has the
       following orders in the market: buy: 100@99 50@100 — sell: 50@102
       100@103. Now a Pension fund sent in a large order to buy 500 stocks
       via a brokerage firm. The brokerage firm decides to put in an
       iceberg order to not cause the market to move against her (if she
       would just put in the market order, other market participants will
       see her eagerness to buy and think ‘oh lets see how badly she wants
       it, let me higher my prices’). So she puts in an iceberg order
       slicing up the original order in slices of 50 volume (only putting
       in orders of 50 volume after each other when the previous slice is
       filled). after the first 50 volume order at 102 of the HFT firm is
       filled, the algorithm automatically fills up the level again:
       100@99 50@100 — 50@102 100@103. The iceberg order will trigger
       again another trade at 50@102. Now the HFT firm has a short
       position of 100 and just did 2 consecutive sells. This means there
       is an increase in demand, while his position is short! The HFT firm
       needs to retreat or risks losing money… 100@100 50@101 — 50@103
       100@104. the algo of the HFT firm adjusts its prices upward for two
       reasons: 1. It wants to make it more attractive for other
       participants to sell to him (e.g. 2×50@101, and make 1 dollar/share
       on buying back the 100 shares sold at 102). 2. ask more credit for
       participants that are willing to sell (at 103 instead of 102). When
       the algo anticipates very big movements, it might even decide to
       move prices up quite a lot. By moving up prices to 100@101 50@102 —
       50@104 100@105 the HTF firm will very likely buy the stocks at 102
       from other participants who were not fast enough to move their
       prices (because they are unaware of the buying pressure or their
       computers were to slow to react), before the big order is
       completely filled it will have moved prices up past 103 and the
       broker will be forced to buy from the HFT firm at a higher price
       104 (big orders eventually always move the market!). The HFT firm
       has now done a nice scalp, it has bought the shares cheap from
       slower participants and sold to the broker when prices were higher,
       making the 2 dollar/share spread he needs to cover his risks and
       operational costs (co-location, fiber optic cables, fast computers,
       clever programmers, etc…).
       This is not front running! Reading buying/selling pressure based on
       the public feed comes with a huge risk (you could be wrong and sit
       on a position while the market moves against you!), HFT firms need
       to estimate the chance of a big order indicating buying/selling
       pressure. They don’t know whether the orders are real intents or
       will get cancelled (hence they will rather react to trades +
       orders, rather than orders simpliciter). Indeed they do have loss
       making days! They don’t have any advantage in information
       (available to everyone) and they don’t play by different rules (no
       way of jumping the queue). But do they have an advantage due to
       speed, fiber optic cables, co-location, fast and clever algo’s?
       Definitely! Is this advantage unfair? Depends on what you call
       fair..
       Around the 16 hundreds there were a couple of big companies
       involved in transporting and trading products between Europe and
       their colonies. These companies were so big they were owned by
       hundreds of people and their shares were traded amongst investors.
       Some people specialised in the mere buying and selling of these
       shares as news came out about their successes and losses,
       influencing the price of the shares. News however came out
       painstakingly slow. Initially one had to wait several weeks for one
       of the big ships to return to hear about the fail or success
       stories of the enterprise. Soon, people specialised in trading
       these shares based on the information that got out, hired people
       with smaller and faster ships to travel to the colonies and get the
       news about a company before the ship would have returned. Paying
       for these ships or the information that came out of them only made
       sense if you traded a lot and hence your profit depended highly on
       this information. For a normal investor with a longterm perspective
       who would only trade their shares a few times a year it would not
       make sense to pay for this faster information as the costs would be
       higher than his return on investment. Was it fair that there were
       people specialised in the mere trading of those shares that were
       able to pay for these faster ships to get hold of this information
       before anyone else?
       The issue is not technology simpliciter, and it upsets me that
       Lewis’ his book plays on the fears of people towards complex
       technology to sell a juicy fairy tale about HFT rigging the market.
       Another thing to note, is that while descent regulation is good and
       necessary, the more complex regulation and expensive compliance to
       that regulation becomes, the more difficult it is for smaller
       participants to stay afloat, which causes the big players to gain
       even more market share and a privileged position. The big players
       have no issues adjusting their operations to new regulations.
       From MC: You are also over simplifying, but more importantly, while
       you dont want to call it front running of the illegal variety, its
       still the equivalent of front running and you are making Michael
       Lewis’s point that this type of HFT is costing consumers money.
       Those trades could have crossed in a lit market very easily.
       Without the need for the intermediaries to get a return on their
       huge capital investment. THose trades could have been completed
       without the need to “iceberg orders” to hide them. Without the need
       to have 30 plus exchanges and pools to route orders through.
       Dont you think this complications of markets has costs to investors
       ? Someone has to pay for all that investment. Its not a
       contribution to investors.
       We dont know the math of just how much capital is invested by the
       HFT players or just how much risk they are willing to take to get a
       return. Nor do we have a way of knowing just how much risk is
       introduced to the system by their efforts and their algorithms.
       Yes, its true that old school market makers had to take big risks
       and many lost money. But those risks were a reflection of supply
       and demand for the shares of stocks they made markets in. Investors
       paid market makers for those risks, but they knew what they were
       paying and they knew what they were getting.
       And in your over simplification, unless its changed dramatically in
       recent weeks, exchanges in particular, via order types do put
       people to the front of the line, or create multiple lines. All so
       the exchanges can compete as public companies for orders. Do you
       think exchanges want fair markets or higher stock prices ?
       Comment by anarchlinux - April 6, 2014 at 9:19 am
   26. Responding to MC (quoting him from bottom of my post): “You make my
       points. The algos compete because like market makers of the past,
       there are guaranteed profits available. Unlike the past the
       competition between algos create huge risk. Systemic risk. Take out
       HFT and yes spreads may widen. But so what. Thats far better than
       having systemic that could impact us far worse than. The flash
       crash”
       But the subtle differences are everything. The notion of
       “guaranteed profits” is false. Floor traders can, and did, go bust
       back in the day. Same with market makers. Those guys went against
       the tide as a matter of course, and sometimes they drowned. Floor
       traders and market makers live in perpetual fear of informed buyers
       moving size. The perception of “guaranteed profits” is weighed
       against the risk they take every day of getting picked off or
       drowned. HFTs take the same risk. Part of the reason they move so
       quickly, in addition to competing with each other, is to get the
       hell out of the way. I don’t think it’s accurate to use a phrase
       like guaranteed profits when the business model itself contains
       real inherent risk, along with huge implementation costs and the
       substantial risk of being competed out of business by one’s
       fellows. Floor traders and market makers also ate each other back
       in the day, which is why the weaker ones went under. Same with
       HFTs. This brutal competition process belies the notion of
       guaranteed profits and makes the markets function better.
       As for systemic risk, flash crashes etcetera, we had all that stuff
       before HFTs existed. The crash of 87 for example. Or any of the big
       crashes and panics going back since forever. The old system was not
       set up to handle crashes — the human beings just stepped aside when
       everything went under. Systemic crash risk is an age-old market
       problem relating more to human emotion, monetary policy and
       economic boom / bust cycles than market maker functions.
       Also, it’s a very big step, and a heck of an assumption, to say
       that getting rid of HFT is worth it just to forestall the
       possibility of future flash crashes. There are strong arguments,
       and empirical evidence, that HFTs are doing a better job as
       liquidity providers than the previous guys did, as evidenced by
       lower trading costs on net and consistently tighter bid/ask spreads
       over time. If we really wanted to stop the possibility of market
       crashes, we could go back to nickel spreads and put breakers on
       everything. But then trading costs would skyrocket, the i-banks
       like Morgan and Goldman would go back to making many billions off
       spreads, whereas the HFT guys are making far, far less via
       heightened competition, and trading and investing would be more
       expensive for everyone — with future market crashes still a
       fact-of-life likelihood anyway. It is necessary to have a better
       sense of the good HFT provides — which requires taking a hard look
       at the benefits of liquidity provision — before deciding that the
       bad is worth banning HFT on light evidence. Again, the car example:
       If all we heard was the negative side, “get rid of cars” would be
       an easy sell.
       From MC> Every crash has been because of market participants
       ignoring the obvious and saying that we can’t be afraid of
       something because of “black swan” risk. That black swan risks are
       always there. THere are black swan risks to HFT. We cant quantify
       them at all.
       And just because some HFT participants lose money by being willing
       to take more risk doesn’t mean that the game is not rigged.
       A Slot Machine is rigged. Right ? No one hosts a slot machine that
       pays out 100pct or more. Right ? But if one company wants to pay
       more rent to host that slot machine, or wants to slice and dice and
       try to get in front of individual pulls of the slot machine, that
       doesn’t make the slot machine any less rigged against the
       “investor/trader/player” Order types, latency arbitrage , etc
       create a riggged opportunity for HFT players in the AGGREGATE
       All in all, you continue to make my point. The game is so rigged
       that people are willing to invest incredible amounts of money to
       play the game. In their rush to play some take on more. Some lose .
       That doesn’t make the game any less rigged. You have the exchanges
       doing everything possible to create as many pulls of the One Armed
       Bandit as they can and to incent more HFT players to come on board.
       That doesnt make the overall game any less rigged
       As far as the market makers, yes, a lot went out of business.
       PArticularly as spreads narrowed. But they knew the game they were
       playing. That is not the case today. No one knows exactly how the
       game is played or the impact of the risks HFT Players are trading.
       Both the good guys and bad guys. Which is why there is so much
       confusion.
       And this is before we have seen any malicious players. What happens
       when people start trying to hack the messaging systems or do the
       equivalent of DDOS attacks on quotes to create confusion ?
       We dont know what happens.

   27. The other issue nobody talks about with HFT is the almost complete
       lack of system security. When every microsecond counts adding code
       to check for malicious and malformed messages is a luxury few can
       afford. The will come a time when somebody figures out how to crash
       or manipulate the opposing traders systems with a malformed data
       packet and then things will get really interesting.

   28. A friend pointed me toward this post and asked my opinion. Thought
       I’d post up my reply to him:
       “Front Running” implies illegal activity or violation of a customer
       relationship. To front run someone means operating on illegally
       obtained information, screwing over a client with whom you have a
       fiduciary relationship, or both at the same time. Neither applies
       to HFT. The information they use is legally obtained and
       technically in the public domain. Whether the exchanges should
       provide it is another question. But there is no front running if
       one is rigorous as to what front running actually means.
       The idea of a “guaranteed profit” does not fit empirical evidence –
       HFTs erode their own profits by narrowing the spreads. HFTs compete
       viciously with each other to capture a piece of the bid/ask spread,
       which in turn narrows that spread and lowers trading costs.
       Technically an old school market maker would have a guaranteed
       profit if he were the only MM connecting the bid and offer. But the
       presence of multiple market makers introduces competition, which is
       why margins are narrowing. Consider: “TABB Group estimates that US
       equity HFT revenues have declined from approximately $7.2 billion
       in 2009 to about $1.3 billion in 2014. Looking at recent public
       data, the profitability of HFT firms in the US equities market has
       declined, just as the number of players has decreased… If the
       exchanges, brokers and HFTs are not reaping the rewards, then where
       is this leakage going? This money is going back to investors in the
       form of better and cheaper executions, as few if any institutional
       investors we have interviewed – and we have interviewed thousands –
       have ever expressed that their equity implementation costs have
       increased, meaning … trading just becomes cheaper and cheaper. That
       cost comes from somewhere: market makers, speculators, brokers and
       exchanges.”
       The idea of a “guaranteed profit” also does not fit risks and costs
       of HFT. The whole reason Knight Capital got acquired is because
       their algo blew up and cost them hundreds of millions (I forget the
       amount). HFTs take a lot of risk in the same manner that old floor
       trader and market makers took risk. Market crash? Hosed. Algo
       crash? Hosed. HFTs also invest huge amounts in software and
       infrastructure. What happens if your firm invests $500 million and
       then your algorithm goes bad? Hosed. There is no guaranteed profit
       any more than a grocery store has a guaranteed profit because it
       can mark up the wholesale price. The risks lie elsewhere.
       Much of Cuban’s characterization, on balance, can be applied (or
       mis-applied) to the old systems. If one wanted to critique floor
       trading, or old school exchange market making, one could similarly
       hand wave about guaranteed profits and such. But those guys can and
       did have real risks, and went bust at times, and had general
       competitive risks from each other that thinned the herds
       dramatically. Even in floor trading’s heyday, the majority of
       would-be floor traders busted out.
       The liquidity provision of HFT is underestimated. These guys who
       bitch about the sketchy issues are still overstating the magnitude
       of the problem — which resides at the margins — versus the
       beneficial aspects of the core activity. It’s a weighting thing.
       They are under-weighting the value of large-scale buying and
       selling activity. For those of us who buy and sell infrequently, it
       is value-add to have others who buy and sell very frequently, as
       such that odds are greater that when we want to transact, someone
       is Johnny-On-The-Spot. If you underweight that core provisional
       value, the relative size of the problems gets distorted. Imagine a
       conversation of the relative merits of the automobile — people
       getting killed, pollution, fuel cost, traffic jams etc — without
       factoring in the net positives.
       The smartest guys in the room (who are non-HFT) are not bothered.
       Cliff Asness runs ~$100 billion for fees measured in basis points.
       If anyone should be up in arms at HFT shenanigans it’d be him, as
       every basis point taken from an institutional money manager’s
       performance is food out of mouths. But he is chill about it. This
       is a simple point but one of the largest points of all.
       From:MC. Did you read my post? You make my points. The algos
       compete because like market makers of the past, there are
       guaranteed profits available. Unlike the past the competition
       between algos create huge risk. Systemic risk. Take out HFT and yes
       spreads may widen. But so what. Thats far better than having
       systemic that could impact us far worse than. The flash crash

   30. Very good summary, given that it took only 2 hours.
       Exchanges don’t regulate because exchanges make money out of
       volume. The way to regulate is simple. First HFT should not have
       information on the order book. Second, all trades can enter a very
       short “time zone” in which they are randomised in such a way that
       the flow is not disturbed.
       The third way is to create an exchange only for HFT. Let them fight
       it out as grown ups. Stealing candies from babies is not really
       ethical.
       No one can really know the impact of HFT on price formation.
       Excessive leverage in any system creates unknown risks.

   31. Before HFT did we not have market makers who took the spread? And
       is quote stuffing not just price discovery (although illegal) ?
       Comment by Simon Galbraith - April 4, 2014 at 3:50 pm
   32. I first would comment that you are either are completely unaware,
       or completely misinforming your readers in regards to how retail
       trades would be executed via their online brokerage. In general,
       with any retail brokerage firm, your stock order will actually
       never reach an exchange, and never be able to be bought or sold by
       competing HFT firms. In reality, TD, Schwab, etc. will have sold
       your order flow to a particular market making firm. These firms get
       first dibs on your order, and its easy to understand why. Let’s say
       I want to buy stock A, and being a liquid name, I decide to enter a
       market order when the bid is 60, offer is 60.02. The firm paying
       for my order flow will know that as long as my order is executed
       inside the NBBO, it is a legitimate order. They might try to buy
       the stock at 60.01 in the actual market place, and then sell me
       60.02, and pocket this difference. They might even trade it at the
       same price and collect the rebate. If they don’t want my order they
       can dump it on the exchange for HFT firms to fight over. I won’t
       comment on whether payment for order flow is bad, but it has been
       going on before HFT.
       Furthermore, in regards to algorithms “jumping ahead,” of orders,
       there is no way to jump ahead of an order in a FIFO market. If I
       decide to place a bid at the beginning of the day at 60.01, a HFT
       can’t jump ahead of me at noon because they are faster.
       Additionally, let’s follow up on your example of jumping ahead of a
       larger trader establishing a position. If a large trader lifts all
       the offering orders on a single exchange, there is no way for a
       firm to cancel those resting orders. Now, after those resting
       orders are hit, they can adjust the price they are willing to sell
       that security. But, this is no different than how market makers of
       the past functioned, or most aspects of business function. If a
       farmer sells apples to restaurants, he initially establishes a
       price. If more and more restaurants, or a single restaurant keeps
       buying his apples, he has the right not to sell apples for the same
       price. A restaurant doesn’t need to keep buying apples from him,
       and ultimately, they could buy apples instead of oranges. On the
       institutional brokerage level, or prime broker level, I would just
       say that if a broker’s execution is slipping because they can’t
       keep up with bigger/more savvy firms, it is akin to competition in
       any other industry.
       In regards to strategies, and profitability, I believe you’ve not
       conceptualized reality in that both personnel and technology
       related costs could make a profitable strategy actually
       unprofitable. Every time Google, Twitter, or any website sells ad
       space, they are making money. It’s always a profitable transaction.
       However, after factoring costs for servers, programmers, etc., it
       might be a net loser.
       Fragmentation, payment for orderflow, massive indexing/etfs, poor
       risk controls, etc. are all risks to the financial markets. There
       are been crashes in ’08 that had legitimate fundamental reasons,
       and crashes like the flash crash. There are problems that need to
       be addressed, however, a long-term investor should be more
       concerned about what amounts to a one bps cost to their investment.

   33. Sorry. I am not talking about conspiracy theory.
       Comment by ssregi11 - April 4, 2014 at 2:56 pm
   34. To be sure, I am talking about a big conspiracy theory. Most
       retails brokers don’t have capital or talents to handle retail
       orders properly. So they just reroute the orders to an order
       processor in exchange for order flow rebate.
       Almost all the people in HFT I have met have no training in
       regulation, practically no understanding of fiduciary obligation,
       or worse yet the regulatory premise of leverage or order
       submission.
       Their compliance officers, of course, have no idea of technology.
       So, there have been so many accidental strategies somehow making
       money everyday. Most of them did not make a big money.
       Those who understood why they were making money and exploited the
       regulatory incompetence made big. As my example shows, the order
       matching system did not front run client orders, but what happens
       on the exchange is fronrunning. I believe that this is a breach of
       fiduciary obligation. Do you think regulators have the equipment to
       discern this kind of subtle difference? Computer clocks are based
       on 60MHz crystal. And the time markings are done on different
       machines.
       Again, there are a handful of HTFs that make money as a fully
       independent systems, but not that many.
       The so-called latency arb is certainly profitable, but not a
       something worthy of $250MM trading capital, unless you know how to
       create latency when you wants. (I believe creating latency
       intentionally is a fraud per Exchange Act.)

   36. Knight used to process 1/3 all the U.S. retails orders. Retail

       Knight may match the orders internally or just reroute the order to

   38. No, I am not underestimating the scale of HFTs. My points are
       Completely Independent Prop HFT should abide by Reg T fully and
       preemptively. And the Reg T applies to even unexecuted open orders.
       The capital cost is quite high. Layering short orders are
       practically impossible as all the short orders should have borrowed
       the stocks in advance. Don’t tell me HFT can borrow stocks in
       milliseconds.
       Most HFTs are working as a broker dealer or just using BD’s
       regulatory exemption. To utilize the BD’s exemption, the regulatory
       checks should be done through firm wide regulatory checking system.
       There is no room for optimization.
       Once, a BDs’ exemption is utilized, the system is a BD. As such,
       the system should 1) maintain orderly and fair market and 2) keep
       its fiduciary obligation. It does not matter TD America routed the
       order to the system or not. Once the system sees an order (X) that
       is not its own, the system should stop any processing its own order
       till the order X is published by the exchange if the order is
       routed to an exchange.

       Beyond that, I think this is true: “there is so little knowledge

       that someone needed to start the conversation” because the issue is
       complex and inherently not reducible to sound-bites or easy
       metaphors that link up with normal everyday human experience. There
       is also very little knowledge and understanding of how quantum

       It’s not just quotes stuffing! I suspect simular funnyness on the

       a bit sleezy I agree, and infinately simple to fix at the
       regulatory (even exchange self-regulatory) level.
       Also, there are are ways to side step the issues created by quote

       Mark, one item that is missing from all of these arguments is that
       HFT companies receive a rebate (get paid) to provide “liquidity”.
       So while the “normal” investor pays commission to purchase and
       sell; the HFT companies get paid by the exchanges every time they
       get hit on the bid-side.
       Not only do they make money on the front-running, but also receive
       healthy payments from the exchange for the illusion of their
       volume.
       I quit trading years ago; when the exchanges overturned “flash
       crash” trades; meaning I couldn’t even make money when the algos
       went wrong.
       It’s more than fixed – it’s geared heavily on the side of the algo
       traders (because they don’t have to pay when they make mistakes).

   43. Richard – @darthallies… You are absolutely correct, there is no
       such thing as a truly riskless financial instrument. Even T-Bills
       have a theoretical risk. However, consider that the (recently
       delayed) IPO for Virtu, one of the larger HFT firms around, in
       their pre-IPO disclosures indicated that from January 1, 2009
       through December 31, 2013, a total of 1,238 trading days, they lost
       money on exactly 1 day. Definitely not riskless, but pretty close.
       Even if you had the ability to reverse engineer all of the various
       proprietary algorithms in HFT land, “Quote Stuffing” (explained
       well in this article: http://wapo.st/QLKNCJ ) often rendered Thor
       (RBC’s smart routing mechanism) ineffective.
       There are many layers of this onion and I can only hope that many
       more will now be revealed soon. I’m simply thankful that we now
       live in a day/time where social media, Twitter, blogs and the like
       make these kind of secret little evils much easier to expose. From
       the late 1990’s through the early 2000’s, SOES (Small Order
       Execution Service) bandits were the scourge of the trading
       industry. Despite substantial efforts by industry associations to
       educate congress, regulators and anybody else that would listen,
       these leaches found a way to expose an order routing system that
       was created for small retail investors to their advantage, making
       billions in the process. This practice went on unchecked until the
       SEC finally woke up in 2003 and ended their honey hole. Not
       surprisingly, many of the current day HFT firms sprang from the
       SOES firms.

   44. About optimized regulatory checking.
       If an automated system performs regulatory checks by itself, the
       system should have a separated account with its own trading
       capital, and probably a separate firm id. Absent these
       independence, HTF has no legal way to optimize regulatory checks
       better than firm wide regulatory checks. Obtaining these
       independence cost a significant trading capital. I don’t think that
       most HFTs are that profitable to justify the trading capital.

   45. For the order internalization. Client orders may be internally
       matched against SIP feed abiding by all the regulations except one.
       For a buy order, if the actual market is down and the SIP feed is
       stale, the order processor can just match the order (sell), and buy
       back from the market.
       As this is a riskless principal trade, the execution should be
       marked as such and the client should be informed. I am not sure
       that those executions are marked properly.

       If your broker is selling access to your orders BEFORE they get to
       the exchange, then blame your broker, not HFT.
       > HFT’s order are being sent out without any checks.
       My understanding is that is not true. HFT have regulatory
       requirements too. Although they are free to optimize them.

   50. Let’s say I sent an order of 10K (~$300K) MSFT. The internal
       matching engine of my broker (or the broker’s order processing
       firm) will probably just reroute the order to an exchange and send
       an prop order of 2K MSFT back to back to the same exchange. Which
       order do you think will arrive at the exchange first?
       Just before a client order being routed to an exchange, the order
       should go through many regulatory checks and the order information
       should be checked in to a database system (Oracle). HFT’s order are
       being sent out without any checks.
       Retail orders can be front-run in reality though the matching
       engine itself did not front-run retail orders.

       identified. I would content it would be trivial to modify it it not
       only take away the risk, but game it to your favour. There is no
       Algorithm, once you know how it works, that can’t be exploited to
       your gain.

   55. Bottom line for me is that I – a small time investor – got out of
       the market a few years ago for this reason. I expect The Tax Man to
       have his hand in my pocket, but not some mystery person/business
       that controls the topside of my trade. Now I invest only in what I
       can see and control (right now that’s real estate), which is much
       different than what my parents and grandparents did to grow their
       capital. If Wall Street wants to continue seeing dollars flow
       through the markets, they should protect the system by shutting
       down this kind of skimming.

   56. Please give citation where exchanges accept money for permitting
       special order types… I’m assuming your talking about intermarket
       sweep orders.. price to comply.. hide not slide??
       What changed is that the exchanges both delivered information
       faster to those who paid for the right AND ALSO gave them the
       ability via order types where the faster traders were guaranteed
       the right to jump in front of all those who were slower (Traders
       feel free to challenge me on this) .

   58. I think Michael Lewis makes a good point in that the HFT firms take
       NO RISK. Once they invest in the tech, they basically mint money.
       And if this is the case, how are they ‘participating’ in the
       market?
       They are simply ‘taxing’ everyone else. Question is, should they be
       allowed to? And more importantly, can you actually stop them?

   59. In my opinion, HFT provides NO value to the Market or investors. It
       siphons billions of $$ to a bunch of really smart people that
       should be spending their time creating something productive. I
       think the best solution (Mark said this during an interview) would
       be for companies to require that their stock have a minimum holding
       period (10 sec, 30 sec, or 1 min). I think this would make
       corporations look like they care a little more about their long
       term investors – the people that vote for their boards. I still
       think Insider Trading is a much bigger problem and find it
       unfortunate that the SEC (with it’s limited resources) has to spend
       time dealing with HFT and not the bigger issues.
       Comment by Jason Deppner - April 4, 2014 at 9:31 am
   60. Good recap of the situation Mark, however one important point that
       should be highlighted is the complicity of our for profit
       exchanges. While HFT’s reap the rewards of dashing in and out of
       the markets in the microsecond world, the exchanges are the ones
       that have made it possible by providing premium co-location
       services and special order types. While these “services” are
       available to anybody, most of the investing public does not have an
       extra few million/year to drop a server into the exchange’s data
       center… ensuring their fiber optic cable to the exchange’s box is a
       couple feet shorter than the competition, thereby giving them a
       couple picoseconds advantage. The exchanges, in lockstep with HFT,
       have reaped these rewards through these co-location fees and
       increased volumes. I feel that this point, should it ever come to
       be widely understood, could truly shake the confidence of the
       investor. Not only were the thief’s stealing, so were the police…
       just in a different “kinda sorta” way.
       Having been a sell side trader for the better part of two decades,
       I’ve had to watch in horror as my customer’s orders have been
       screwed and tattooed in the name of the HFT’s providing
       “liquidity”. While my customers are typically large money managers,
       mutual funds etc, in the end the real customers, those that are
       paying the price, are the investing public. If a mutual fund
       manager pays more because an HFT sniffed out his order and scalps a
       few pennies here and there, so does George and Linda in Dubuque
       when they invest their 401k in said manager’s fund.
       One final point and I’ll go back to my hole… One of the primary
       reasons the big banks have been slow to display any kind of outrage
       is because they’re part of the problem. Every major bank in the US
       (GSAM, Citi, BofA etc) has it’s own black-box HFT style group.
       Tough to point the finger at yourself!

   62. Here’s my analogy for people who don’t really know how trading and
       this issue really work:
       You go to the grocery store to buy milk. As you walk in the door,
       the grocery store stamps a sign on you saying “Here to buy milk.”
       That grocery store has someone paying them to put that sign on you.
       Then, as you go to get that last carton of milk, someone grabs it
       before you do. That person then turns around and sells you the milk
       for more money than the store was charging.
       First, there is nothing wrong with speculation in the
       market…everyone can and should have their own motivations for being
       involved and that’s what “makes a market”. However, the playing
       field should be level and selling access to others’ orders is
       effectively inside information.
       I submit one very simple suggestion for leveling things in what I
       feel is a very fair way:
       All orders at a given price are treated on a time priority. That
       means if I entered my order to buy Apple shares at the same price
       as you but I did so earlier, then I get the first execution at that
       price, no exceptions. The “jumping the line” issue that we have now
       is the real unfairness and is what is allowing the system to be
       gamed. If someone wants to pay up to the next price level that is a
       totally fair part of the market but at the same price time priority
       across all exchanges should exist.
       As this debate progresses, also don’t lose sight of how the
       exchanges are making their money (Putting that sign on the milk
       buyer’s head). Special access, esoteric orders, etc are all major
       revenue streams and the HFT crowd is the cash cow to them, so
       changes will be resisted.
       Full disclosure, I spent 8 years as a NASDAQ market maker, another
       6 as a proprietary trader, and the last 9 in equity research and
       portfolio management.

   63. Brilliant, concise explanation. Just leaves out the cause, which
       will also answer many of the questions posted. HFTs came about and
       thrived as a result of stock exchanges converting from private
       memberships to “for profit” publicly traded corporations. That is
       when and why they stopped servicing the customer and began
       exploiting them in an effort to create and exploit new revenue
       streams. Had exchanges maintained a fiduciary responsibility to the
       customers they were built to serve instead of the shareholders and
       investors desperate for constant growth, this debacle never would
       have happened. The model of a “for profit” exchange is an
       unsustainable one as it is impossible to continue to exist when you
       put investor profits ahead of customer fills.

   64. Anyone remember rules 127 and 72B? A specialist could sit on your
       super dot order for more than a minute before giving you a report.
       In some issues, I couldn’t get 500 shares without paying up a
       quarter on every trade. Or how about the Nasdaq lawsuit in the late
       nineties. OTC market Makers were colluding with each other and
       fading whenever even one of them was called.
       Im not defending HFT, they put me out of business as a floor guy,
       but I don;t see where there is any breach of fiduciary going on
       here. The fact remains customers have it better than they ever have
       had it before, and when you eliminate incentives to provide
       liquidity, it will worsen.

   65. As for the transaction tax solution, consider making it rebatable
       if the position in question is held for a year and a day (the same
       standard that determines long-term versus short-term capital gain).
       We already grant long-term positions an extremely favorable tax
       treatment, so we have already made the political judgment that this
       is beneficial to society. Does the HFT issue fold-up shop at that
       point, or does the game just move down the street to someplace
       else? (honestly have no idea)

       in promoting the purpose of the stock market, which is to raise
       equity capital, and realize liquidity for your equity. If you

   68. Good post Mark. I’m not trying to challenge you, but rather share
       my experience.
       What HFT trading seeks to do is read the order flow, something that
       has been happening since the advent of the bucket shop. You point
       out that it is algo’s now trying to do this, and not necessarily
       blatant front running, so there is inherently risk involved. Risk
       of any kind deserves reward.
       Reading the order flow used to be something we paid for in the form
       of seat leases, stand on the floor, and know who is trading what?
       And when they are opening or closing? etc..Now its a matter of
       paying the exchanges for the information as fast as possible and
       having an algo interpret it for you. Exchanges are thriving as a
       result.
       Nothing has changed, just how, and who now has the edge.
       If you really want to catch a thief, look into the structured
       products being marketed through major wirehouses, price them out
       relative to listed options, then tell me how these firms keep any
       of their clients or stay out of hot water with FINRA.

   70. HFT Explained
       First some history since no one has explained how knowing an order
       beforehand makes someone “billions”. It doesn’t! Front running an
       order doesn’t make money unless the order is so large that it moves
       the market in the front runners favor. Front running a client order
       is illegal, and technically this is not what is happening, since
       the HFT trader (who might sit on another floor of the brokerage) is
       neither aware of nor cares about a client order.
       HFT grew out of the need for arbitrage between a stock index and
       the underlying securities. If there was a misalignment then the
       market (i.e. everyone) suffers due to misinformation. The problem
       was really big when stock prices were priced in a 1/8th’s (i.e. 12
       1/2 cents) spread. Moving to penny pricing allowed dealing firms to
       undercut each other which benefited all investors. HFT firms have
       arbitraged this spread away and are shutting down as a result. Here
       is why….
       In order to make this arb work, on say the SP 500, a dealer needs
       to buy the index (say the futures contract) or typically have an
       existing long market exposure through owning all the stocks
       contained in dealer inventory and then sell every 500 stocks at
       exactly the same 1. time; 2. appropriate price differential; and 3.
       appropriate volume to rebalance the portfolio perfectly. AND later
       buy back every single stock in the same fashion. This is why there
       was a race to faster computing power and execution speed and why it
       benefited the market that regulators allowed it. Tighter spreads
       means better information and pricing value for everyone.
       BUT, here is why some in the industry don’t like it…execution speed
       has gotten so fast that it exceeds that of the exchanges. A dealer
       can send an order to determine bid/offer and volume depth and then
       cancel it before it executes; this is called “pinging”. This is
       done to ensure that all the orders placed can be executed at the
       same moment and volume to ensure a perfect risk-free arb. Pinging
       ensures that the market is properly aligned, since there is no
       order executed unless there is profit to be made, but is this fair?
       Naturally markets have fixed bandwidth which results in sharp price
       movements when everyone wants to execute at the same time, such as
       during stock market crashes or dropped calls on cell phones.
       Naturally HFT arbitrage benefits hugely during these periods, and
       as should be clear by now doesn’t cause it. Since the process
       ensures tighter spreads and accurate pricing for all markets
       regulators are having trouble how to respond to the “unfairness” of
       certain participants who know more and sooner than everyone else,
       but that the nature of the free market in information. To argue
       otherwise should require those, like Mr. Cuban, to give up all
       their money to the poor and needy because they didn’t work hard
       enough or smart enough for it.
       And just to get in another dig (since you have read this far) the
       practice and the complexity of the problem is hard to explain to an
       ignorant media and public that prefers sound bites over some hard
       thinking….IMHO.

   72. HFT firms sends out massive amount of orders to the market.
       1. Do the orders abide by reg T?
       2. Are the shorts really borrowed?
       1000 share each over 1000 stocks costs 15MM initial margin. To send
       out orders over 10 ticks, the firms should have at least $150MM
       trading capital sitting on their account. Let’s say these are buy
       orders. Now, the firm cancels bottom tenth orders and send new
       orders on top of their best price. If the firm sends out the new
       orders before cancel confirmation, the firm needs extra $15MM. When
       the market is fast, the firm may need to send out 4 layers of
       orders above the previous price, which means extra $60MM. Now, what
       happened to their sell orders sitting above the market? If some of
       them were executed, let’s say two ticks, that’s another $30MM.
       Just to handle reasonably fast market, HFT firms need $250MM
       trading capital. The real question is whether the capital is
       committed or just booked via other assets which the firms do now
       have the ownership.
       I am sure that the HFT firms are taking advantage of BD exemptions,
       but the exemptions are only for making orderly markets not for prop
       trading
       The Risk of HFT? What if all the orders within 10 ticks are
       executed? The firm should come up with $150MM out of somewhere. For
       the firm, it is better to sell them and take loss of $5MM rather
       than ending up in settlement failure, which guarantees FINRA
       investigation. Look at Knight, they could not settle the trades,
       doesn’t they?

   75. Balazs, Cross exchange arbitrage has always existed and I have no
       problem with that. What you’re describing is front running enabled
       by the exchanges by selling the ability to execute the trades ahead
       of an order hitting the book. The fact that only part of the order
       is front run because some of the order already hit the book on
       another exchange is irrelevant. That isn’t cross-exchange arbitrage
       where two trades are made with two separate counter-parties – each
       at least standing *a chance* of receiving the price that they
       expected. In your example, it is almost assured that the one
       counter-party being front run won’t. Payment for order flow is
       another opportunity to front run whereby an entity gets to choose
       how orders are routed.
       Of course, all of that assumes your assertion that cross-exchange
       front running is all that’s occurring and that orders aren’t being
       made available to a select few before they hit any exchange. I wish
       I shared your faith. Even though we are told that ‘Flash Trades’
       (where order information WAS being bought ahead of execution on any
       exchange) are no longer permitted on major exchanges, I’m not so
       sure.

       Thank God! I was beginning to think I was the only person asking
       this question.
       I find it ridiculous to see so-called, ‘simple’ solutions being
       suggested such as applying a transaction tax and introducing a
       0.5-1 second lock on orders or calls for new legislation etc.
       Front running is already illegal.
       Trading on advance/insider information is already illegal too.
       What is happening here is akin to allowing a chosen few to see
       other people’s cards in a Poker game – and then having to listen to
       venal and corrupt individuals trying to defend it as being a good
       thing for everyone.
       There is NO good reason in allowing anyone to see anyone else’s
       orders before they hit the book. The fact that Specialists have
       been able to do so historically is not an excuse to do so in the
       modern, technological age. They did it that way because there was
       no better alternative at the time – not because a chosen few being
       able to all orders before they’re matched was a ‘good’ thing for
       everyone. HFT front runners pay the exchanges to be able to do
       this. So, what happens if they don’t pay? They don’t get the
       information. Which means the exchanges can stop this nonsense in a
       heartbeat if they wanted to. Actually, we don’t even need them to
       ‘want to’. We already have laws against front running and inside
       information. Those laws do not excuse those practices just because
       they occur at sub-millisecond speeds or for transactions of just a
       penny.
       I wish people would stop considering other alternatives as a
       remedy. It only distracts attention away from the real problem –
       and therefore the only solution to stop the cheating and rigging in
       this way.
       If a chosen few were allowed to see your cards in a Poker Game,
       would you really be calling for a ‘tax’ on them instead of just
       demanding that the ‘pay-for-view’ stopped?

          + marmun1, it’s not that banks see your order before you place
            it, but they see it in the first exchange, and then they can
            frontrun you to other exchanges *assuming* that the first
            exchange was only part of the order.

   79. Great writing, but I’d suggest its like anything unknown, it seems
       scarier than it really is, and even if you assume HFT is siphoning
       off billions (for the sake of argument), that is nothing compared
       to the trillions of wealth generated in the markets. The
       drastically declining returns of HFT funds seems to disagree with
       that hypothesis anyway – IMHO they’ve created so much pricing
       efficiency (or scared retail investors away from the markets),
       they’ve caused their own demise and are now largely competing
       against each other.
       This isn’t to say anything is right or moral – just that its not as
       great a problem as people[/media] are making out. The “evil
       bankers” are just geeks who love math, code and an infinitely tough
       challenge – and majority are not making millions. The average quant
       salary is far less than the west coast. They’re doing it for love
       of the math & a challenge.
       Like all things (cars, planes, jobs), the markets are becoming
       automated and, better or worse, *high-frequency-trading* is a part
       of that that will stay. There may be a few hitches along the way
       (front-running), but the value destroyed and corruption by humans
       is equally as bad.
       The upside from having emotionless markets could bring stability
       for everyone. Better to level the playing field and let everyone
       invest with algorithmic precision. Maybe by 2100 the markets will
       be perfectly correlated to the risk-value at present moment in the

   81. Mark, you’re right. Although there is a considerable amount of
       information about HFT, there is a lack of understanding of what is
       going on with HFT. And yes, the conversation needs to continue (you
       needn’t worry that you have to start it; a number of experienced
       traders, market structure analysts and academics have been doing
       that for nearly a decade.
       This may help the conversation, written after the CBS 60 Minutes
       segment (not by me). It’s a wee bit longer than your 2,571 words
       but based on nearly 30 years experience
       watching/researching/analyzing the evolution to automated trading:
       “No, Michael Lewis, the US equities market is not rigged.
       It’s been quoted for the past four days by major media (NYT, WSJ,
       CNBC, FT, Bloomberg, LA Times, Barron’s, AFP and MarketWatch, on
       and offline and TV).

   82. I used to build the HFT networks for a large financial institution
       (Fortune 50 sized). Your information is for the most part right on.
       But as others have noted, the vast majority of investors should be
       long term investors, where the HFT game really shouldn’t have any
       impact. Yes, the flash crash phenomenon is a major issue, and needs
       to continue to be addressed by the SEC. Some of the recent changes
       they have instituted to prevent flash crashes help, but don’t go
       far enough. Now, has HFT killed the day trader? Absolutely. Day
       traders are playing a rigged game against a stacked deck.
       The larger issue, not really addressed here, are the so called
       “dark pools” where a lot of very suspect transactions occur daily,
       and to date are perfectly legal. The fact that the SEC allows these
       transactions to occur with little to no oversight is mind boggling.

   83. Mark, I bet no HFT trader will seriously challenge your assessment.
       Everyone knows that this kid of front running is exploiting a
       loophole in the system and adds no value. Who wants to voluntarily
       put lipstick on a pig… Hopefully it’ll be one of those “it was nice
       while it lasted” type of thing for them.
       diyinvestorsource, your logic is like saying that cars are so much
       safer than 50 years ago, so we shouldn’t care about the sudden
       acceleration in Toyotas. It’s true that Joe Shmo selling 50 shares
       of MSFT is going to be affected only minimally. But what if the
       mutual funds in his 401k or his company’s retirement fund gets
       nicked 1% per year. The book mentions an alleged $300MM per year
       loss for a $9B fund, which is 3.3%. That is a lot if you start to
       compound year after year, even if only half of it is true.

   84. While front-running is making it’s most of money off of big trades,
       and so not small investors, related HFT strategies like quote
       stuffing and stop hunting can crush the individual trader.
       Artificially tripping a stop-loss on an out-of-the-money option can
       be worth a significant chunk of the total position.

   85. The negative impact you describe is dead-on and hits anyone that
       decides to go the mutual fund route, which is most small individual
       investors that shy away from individual small to mid-cap stocks
       with their lower volumes and lower liquidity and the attention
       those investments demand. They already pay a price to go the funds
       route – the funds loads (direct or indirect). HFT is a greed
       surcharge assessed by the HFT traders that has to impact the small
       investor in the pocket book and undermine confidence/trust in the
       markets. Time to bury gold coins in the backyard. :)

   86. Breaking down some of the ways this costs you money:
       Quote Stuffing – which should be illegal and IS illegal when a
       person does it (it’s running a ‘boiler room’). Aside from
       perpetuating a fraud and slowing things down the way Mark
       described, it slows things down in real time as investors waste
       time chasing phantom trades; trying to execute on orders that don’t
       exist, which prevents them from actually doing the work their
       clients pay them to do.
       Front Running – many of the posters in the comments here seem to
       think that it’s simple price shaving, it’s not. They are straight
       raising the price of every large trade. Most trades don’t occur at
       a single price point, they occur at a range. If you want to buy 10k
       shares of Apple and are willing to pay $600.98 – $601.00 per share
       an HFT will see your buy order, buy up every share available at
       your low end and then sell you it’s newly owned shares at your top
       end. They effectively cost you $200. How? Because they didn’t even
       have 10k shares of Apple to sell you. They only bought the shares a
       microsecond before you so they could sell them to you. If not for
       the HFT you would have bought the 10k shares from the original
       seller for $600.98, but because the HFT bought all those shares out
       from under you you have to pay $601 to get them from the HFT.
       They added NO value and no liquidity, all they did was scalp you.
       And this too is illegal when a person does it. It’s trading on
       inside information.
       Small Investors – but what if you’re just a small investor, or a
       simple day trader? That’s fine, As long as you keep it small and do
       all your own investing. But most people don’t run their own 401k,
       IRA, or other investment accounts. All those pooled accounts are
       big deals and they all have to deal with HFTs which means the ROI
       of any of your pooled investments are losing a % because of HFTs.
       In answer to why the exchanges don’t regulate it, because the HFT
       firms pay the exchanges for access.

   87. Good stuff Mark – these guys clearly have exploited a hole that
       needs plugging and they’ve been making a killing while nobody has
       taken action. They’ve also set themselves up as the great scapegoat
       when the market does crash…everyone will point their fingers at
       them and the Fed will get spared while they’ve been the biggest
       market manipulators of all.

   88. Ok so we agree that this is a really small impact. And only on
       transactions. Lots of trading = high HFT impact (relatively
       speaking, it’s still pennies). Little trading = low HFT impact.
       That’s one point for long-term holdings. As for the crash in 2008 –
       anyone who was in stocks in 2007 and needed to spend the money in
       2009 needs an idiot’s guide to investing. Even at the best of times
       that’s asking for trouble.
       Someone who was in stocks in 2007 and didn’t look at the market
       until 2012 never knew anything happened. I let others play the
       short-term game. There is only going to be one trader that is the
       fastest in the world and they will hurt everyone else who is
       playing that game. There are millions who have made and will make a
       profit from long-term holdings. The flash crash? I would have loved
       to buy into that since it was cheaper than the day before or after.
       But I’m way too slow because I’m just not paying attention most of
       the time. I only take advantage of old-school slow crashes.
       So if HFT imposes a tax of 0.0125% when I buy today, and the same
       when I sell in 50 years (ok maybe it’s been regulated out of
       existence by then). And if all I know between now and the day in 50
       years that I sell is that the companies I own keep making profits
       that get to me eventually, why do I care? Trying to beat the HFTs
       at their game is a great way to lose. Doesn’t matter to me. I’m
       patient. Playing a different game is how you win.
       People including you are talking about a 1c/share tax to slow this
       down, which is a far bigger impact than the HFT problem. Whether
       that cost goes to a trading company or the government it’s the same
       to me – too small to care.
       You can call that rigged, but investors have 99 problems and HFT
       ain’t one.

   90. The problem isn’t so much HFT but rather the proliferation of
       trading venues and their intended purpose. For years, stocks were
       traded on the NYSE and then Nasdaq with no issue from a market
       structure perspective. Reg NMS changed this. Counter-intuitively,
       having more options available to you in terms of places you could
       buy or sell has now become a bad thing (but what about CAPITALISM
       you might ask). For profit public exchanges have created two tiers
       of investors by allowing direct feeds that give an edge through the
       various means described above (quote stuffing, flash pricing, etc).
       The second tier is the American retail investor and even large
       banks in many cases that is continuously being skimmed from getting
       a better price and shown fake liquidity. That’s not capitalism,
       it’s stealing. For a small investor, do penny’s on a trade matter?
       For a large bank, do millions of dollars matter? The answer is, of
       course. This is America. We don’t trade our markets like we spin a
       wheel in Vegas. For our stock market to drop 10% intraday due to
       the above mentioned issues (stub quotes), is unacceptable. This
       wasn’t a “glitch”, it was predatory trading and it’s something that
       affects every investor. The real dilemma is how little is known to
       fix the problem. The answer – a not for profit exchange. It solves
       every issue mentioned and would foster a fair, capilist market,
       that we trust. This is something that I plan on devoting quite a
       bit of time to. Get in touch on LinkedIn:

   91. So if buying, why not just place a limit order which requires an
       exact price? Why would it matter if you got a partial fill as
       stocks normally bounce around a bit at any price. You may not get
       filled immediately, but the vast majority of the orders you placed
       would be filled at the price you specify.

   93. For me, a novice investor, the best part about posts like this is
       it helps people to understand there is a huge difference between
       computer-aided trading and what it’s done for spreads, along with
       switching to decimals (what the hell is a steenth?) and the
       skimming or scalping that the front-running does to generate
       millions of dollars of profits for the HFT houses. I’m a capitalist
       and applaud when someone invents a products and makes a huge score
       – good for him or her. But this HFT skimming practice helps no one.
       It adds nothing to the market, facilitates nothing, adds no depth
       or liquidity, provides no service and solves no problems. The guys
       who run these exchanges remind me of the stories of when the mob
       was getting a one dollar ‘tax’ for every window installed in the
       city. It only served to make the crooks a little richer, one window
       at a time.

       taken hostage by Banksters who’s desire is to tax every dollar of
       capital investment. A healthy system would have Financials @ 5% of
       total GDP, where-as today it’s closer to 45%.

   96. You are mostly correct. 6b is wrong however. HFT are very involved
       in small illiquid stocks. The game is different and the spreads get
       wider. The gaming is far more pervasive than the big stocks, Orders
       for 100 shares frequently get front-run. One tactic is to partially
       fill to an odd lot order and becoming invisible to the market. The
       biggest reason for this behavior is broker internalization of order
       flow, and showing HFTers orders beforehand to get “improvement.”
       Instead of getting a fill for .0001 better, you don’t get any fill
       at all as the HFT uses your flashed order as a signal to do the
       exact same trade you wanted to do except sooner. Taking the
       displayed liquidity. What is most ironic is that brokers like to
       talk about price improvement statistics, and only count executed
       traded, while trades that never occured because they were frontrun
       are conveniently left out of their statistics.

   97. Valerie, that creates a disincentive for investors to invest in
       companies with a low share price. I can buy 1 share of AAPL and pay
       tax of .001, or a bunch of shares of a cheap stock and pay
       significantly more.

   99. I also see this as a larger problem of the markets becoming a
       gambling device or in the case of the Fed, to create a ‘wealth
       effect’ that distorts the stock market as an economic indicator.
       Wasn’t the purpose of the stock market to allow entrepreneurs to
       raise capitol to invest in their companies? Aren’t the HFTs
       essentially acting like rats in the granery?
       Comment by Greg Kruzick - April 3, 2014 at 8:49 pm
   100. Nice post and great analogies. Broadly speaking, while I think
       front-running (the heart of the HFT discussion) is morally wrong it
       is capitalism to the extent it is not deemed illegal by the SEC as
       insider trading. For long term investors – preferably in small cap
       stocks – the financial “impact” is negligible. However, the
       potential for further distrust in the stock market (the life blood
       of the US economic engine) and Wall Street is irreparable.
       A bit of history…dating back to the infancy of the stock market,
       NYSE market specialists in theory traded on information related to
       incoming buy/sell orders – i.e., they sold the “ask” price and
       bought the “bid” price which used to be 1/8 pt apart. In many
       instances, these market makers knew they had a willing buyer when
       they bought stock from a seller – thus “front-running” in the
       loosest sense. Further, all trades had to go through them as they
       were the market specialist in that name. Over time, this bid/ask
       spread declined as markets began more fluid and transparent.
       However, the BIG difference is that the old NYSE market specialists
       of year’s past took real risk – they held stock overnight, had real
       capital at risk and where required to always provide a market
       (i.e., a bid) for a stock.
       The issue I have with the HFT firms of today is that are
       front-running purely based on speed and seeing other buy/sell
       orders before they are recorded as “market trades” on the ticket
       tape we laypeople see on CNBC and Bloomberg. They are gaining an
       advantage without putting any capital at risk or providing
       incremental value or liquidity to the marketplace. They are merely
       skimming off the top. And under my moral compass, that is simply
       wrong.
       Unfortunately, this will be nearly impossible to police unless you
       slow everyone down and distribute trade data at the same speed
       (albeit this is geographically challenging given co-location). One
       could suggest bringing trading back to one central exchange maned
       by real people…but there would still be dark pools. One could
       suggest taxing all trades a penny…but HFT would still exploit the
       advantage of speed (but I do like the idea of additional tax
       revenue being raised to help regulate the trading industry). One
       could suggest bringing back wider bid/ask ticks…but HFTs would
       again exploit the market based on their speed until the “real”
       market data caught up.
       At the end of the day I’m not sure what the right answer
       is…public/long term investor behalf will ultimately drive the
       outcome. The one positive is Michael Lewis’ new book at a minimum
       has brought it the forefront of our minds.
       Mark – love Shark Tank…American capitalism at its best!
       Comment by Todd Nelson (@hawkingvalue) - April 3, 2014 at 8:41 pm
   101. Jeff and The Tuna, I take it you are saying that the exchanges
       permit this despite its harmful nature because they are effectively
       taking a cut of the HFT profits. This is certainly possible, albeit
       less likely than not. But given the competitive nature of
       exchanges, if this is true those exchanges that permit the activity
       will be at a competitive disadvantage and end up losing more than
       they gain in the profit split with the HFT because they lose
       listings and volume.
       Now of course it is possible that this won’t happen because of some
       collective myopia, but the more likely result is that if this is
       unproductive it will sort itself out without the SEC promulgating
       additional regulations.
       Once you go down the road of regulation you don’t usually get
       perfectly optimal regulation. This is why people should have to
       tell a more plausible story of structural market failure before
       invoking the cumbersome hand of the regulator.
       In short, this piece makes a better case for why exchanges are
       likely to restrict this activity than it does for its (admittedly
       narrow) proposed remedy of escrowing algorithms with the SEC.

   102. Perhaps the scariest thing here is that an investor of Mr. Cuban’s
       caliber is only kinda/sorta pretty sure he knows what he’s talking
       about in regards to HFT. Not meant as flattery, but guys do not
       amass the resources to buy NBA teams without having pretty good
       investment instincts and thorough investment knowledge.
       One point Mark alluded to but could have explored further: people
       are *risking* billions of dollars for a chance that place in the
       front of the line, and given the open warfare between HFTs, there’s
       no guarantee the person rigging the market today will be rigging
       the market tomorrow. Some of those billions sunk into fiber optic
       cables and algos will go to waste.
       But the most important point here is that the securities markets
       exist to enable people to invest in companies they believe in, or
       to speculate on the possible future values of securities, providing
       vital liquidity in the process.
       HFTs appear to do nothing to enable this investing process, and
       therefore there is no reason for the exchanges to allow it, except
       for the short-term profits they reap while taking on unknowable
       risks.

   104. Mark it is great of you to clarify in some amount of detail (much
       more than what is allowed to be publicly discussed on financial
       news networks) regarding fraudulent aspects of the trade. The
       mathematics behind HFT varies from very simple to complex
       artificial intelligence driven algorithms especially on the
       millisecond and tick level and the MAJORITY of these algorithms are
       truly providing liquidity in smart ways that benefit the ordinary
       investor. I don’t contend this. You did not mention the prolonged
       effect cross exchange arbitrage and darkpools have had, but I
       thought to touch on it a little bit here; you see the greater the
       fragmentation of the market because of different order types, the
       greater the proliferation of dark pools and other HFT pools that
       can game it from different angles. You’re right when you say the
       average person isn’t concerned with his investment and the
       investors aren’t going to sound the alarm because there is too much
       at stake with retail outflow in recent years. But the retail guys
       have less liquidity to contend with today in the lit market and are
       soon coming to the realization of what’s happening under the hood.
       Day traders are unnecessarily and very swiftly stopped out of
       intraday positions only for the price to revert seconds or minutes
       later, almost levitating back to their original prices. I have seen
       the most out of the money stops get hit on an intraday basis like
       it was an orchestrated panic. It is unnerving for other people to
       have that kind of power in the market, or for there not to be
       enough ‘real’ liquidity chasing ‘real’ price discovery. The average
       guy is catching up, but in many ways, he’s got no alternative way
       to express his opinion when all the exchanges seem to dictate the
       rules of the game, watchdog-free.

   107. This read more like the low-latency part of HFT. That is mostly
       front-running of large institutional trades. It does impact the
       little guy indirectly in as much of that which is being front run
       is likely their pension/401k/etc. Just because they’re not trading
       it, doesn’t mean they’re not affected. There’s also the stop
       hunting algos which don’t require a low-latency to function. The
       algo will fire of thousands of orders and immediately cancel them
       in hopes to trigger the hedges or trailing stops of other traders.
       When those stops get triggered, a cascading effect occurs and the
       HFT algos monkey hammer the market. You can tell the stop hunting
       algos as they produce a square wave pattern on the millisecond
       charts. This is a special privilege as well.

       points” been prosecuted while these “titans of wall street” are
       free to boast about their “innovation” (read: we have 50 ways to
       rip you off and enjoy discussing every one over expensive cocktails
       at restaurants where you – the little people – cannot get a
       reservation)?

   110. Thanks, Mark. It is interesting to note that this game has been
       played throughout time, just at much slower speeds. As a former
       equity market maker for a large bank in the early 2000’s, I was
       endlessly frustrated dealing with similar fruntrunning. Back then,
       if you wanted to trade with other dealers with a size larger than
       the SOES amount, you had to basically send a message to the other
       dealer with the size and they had to respond. If you sent 50,000 to
       buy to Knight Trading or any other wholesaler, they would delay
       their response while they bought everything in sight above them.
       Then they would sell it all to you all 1/16 higher. Thats how they
       made money. Seems like ancient times looking back on it now, but
       that much has changed over the years. SuperSOES went a long way to
       correct those issues. Now the same game is being played, just in
       milliseconds vs 10’s of seconds. The real difference as you note is
       the unknown effects of the super speed algos on the markets in
       times of stress. There really should be a way to prevent the algos
       from seeing any order size larger than their offer or bid.

   111. Mark when you keep saying that the market is rigged you’ve going
       to give people the idea that they put in $1 and get 50 cents back
       every time. Or maybe just that it’s a slow drain like playing
       blackjack for too long. And I’m sure you know that. But what you
       describe is more like adding a commission of 1 penny on each share
       you buy. Sure it would be nice if that was cleaned up.
       On the other hand we’ve gone from paying commissions of $300 for
       every trade to getting them from $10, $5, $3, or just plain free.
       Even for big traders that don’t even notice their commissions, this
       effect would have to be so small that it’s just a tiny blip in the
       risks they’re already taking. I just don’t see anything that points
       to this being an issue of market structure that even comes near the
       scale of the normal risks that every investor has to take in the
       market let alone a lot of things that have been going on for the
       last 100 years that were just as questionable. Those didn’t destroy
       the market. Once in a while they created great buying opportunities
       for investors who were prepared.
       There is a very simple way to outsmart the HFTs. Be a long-term
       investor. The less you trade the less they can take. And the longer
       you hold the faster they lose interest. Unless you’re trying to
       play their game and complaining that someone got a small edge over
       you, you don’t need to follow their rules.

          + Did you read all of it. i said a specific part of it was
            rigged . And i didnt say it was anything but pennys or less.
            And being long term doesnt out smart anyone. All the risk
            impact the performance of your portfolio. Being long term
            didnt outsmart the tech crash or 2008 if you had any needs for
            those funds prior to the years and years it took the market to
            recover
            and electronic trading and decimalization gave you the
            savings, not HFT

   113. Please advise on this video, it involves Forex trading and
       algorithms, not HFT by definition but short term positions:

   114. I trade the indexes, futures and commodities every day. How things
       have changed…years ago things liked value propositions, competency,
       management, etc derived a value; today, it’s who gets to see my
       orders, very quickly buy and then sell me the stock. It’s turned
       into a very large casino with some social interests “guiding” the
       market and NOTHING to do with the company’s. So with HFT, what is
       the value of all the fundamental analysis, Cramer and CNBC?

   116. It’s been going on since the buttonwood tree and trust me it’s
       cheaper than floor brokers they used to front run marathons now
       sprints and the mkt needs the hft bids when it crashes! the hustle
       never ends i was born into it so i know first hand this is nothing!
       Comment by Sean Sheehan - April 3, 2014 at 4:34 pm
   117. Mark, To me it is all about a somewhat level playing field. If my
       Mutual Funds,401K Funds, and TD Ameritrade are all using the same
       High Speed Trading system then we all have a fighting chance at
       benefiting from HFT. The reality is we don’t. Only the well
       financed firms that can afford the fee’s and systems that allow
       then to collocate and get the sub millisecond advantage will make
       the money and manipulate the market. We no longer have pension
       structures that are independent of the stock market. All of our
       retirements accounts plunge most of our hard earned savings into
       the stock market in hopes that it will be on an up swing when we
       actually retire. Not always. Asked those that tried to retire in
       2007/2008 etc..
       The converse of HFT that is even more bizarre is that if a Market
       Maker shorts a million+ shares of stock, the DTCC (Depository Trust
       & Clearing Corporation) gives them THREE DAYS to locate the actual
       shares of stock. If they don’t find those shares or it runs into
       many days they can just cancel the trade and no harm no foul!.
       So you allow both HTF at sub milliseconds and then Days and Days to
       cover if you are pumping phantom stock.
       Neither should be allowed. Pick a reasonable time, 1 second. They
       have to actually locate the shares within that second whether it is
       a buy or sell side order and then charge 1cent per transaction and
       fund the SEC so it can keep everyone honest.
       Comment by grumpy (@GrumpeG0lf3r) - April 3, 2014 at 4:33 pm
   118. Douglas, the short answer is that Exchanges are making more money
       allowing the HFT’s to use their pipes. In turn, the Brokers /
       Market Makers are being paid on trades to use certain exchanges
       instead of paying a flat rate or fee. This has upended the dynamic
       the exchanges have historically created, the overall effect of
       which makes the market that much more ephemeral and opaque. In my
       humble opinion, this short term view taken by Wall Street does not
       lend itself to the long term overall health of the markets, foreign
       or domestic.
       Comment by Jeff Pyzyna - April 3, 2014 at 4:22 pm
   119. It seems there’s a very easy solution to this, and it would be
       good for the economy on all levels: add a trading tax of .001 per
       share sold. This means if you move a million shares, you pay $1,000
       for this tax. For a deep-pocket market investor selling a million
       shares of something, that $1,000 is barely pocket change. A
       rounding error. For the average market investor, selling maybe
       20,000 shares at a time, it’s an added twenty bucks — far less than
       the commission on the sale. For the HFTs, it would grind their
       business to a halt.
       Since the purpose of the markets is to provide companies with
       access to capital and provide liquidity to investors (thus
       encouraging them to provide the capital that companies need), not
       to create trading schemes to make number crunchers rich through
       algorithmic trickery, this would solve all of those problems. And,
       the tax revenues could be used to provide further security for the
       markets, or to replenish pension funds that were wiped out by dicey
       derivatives.

   120. Why anyone is allowed to see other people’s orders, than front run
       ahead of them defies explanation. How the SEC allowed the Exchanges
       to stop serving the public interest is mind boggling
       Comment by Barry Ritholtz (@ritholtz) - April 3, 2014 at 4:18 pm
   121. Douglas- the exchanges like volume. Volume is a huge part of their
       business. They, of course, need to provide stability, but the money
       is in the volume.
       Comment by The Tuna (@OriginalTuna) - April 3, 2014 at 4:13 pm
   122. Mark, this is a very nice summary. The only thing that I want to
       comment on your post, is that in reality algorithm design and
       development for HFT its not really that complicated; and you
       certainly don’t need the smartest people to implement a successful
       one for a given market niche.

   124. Wasn’t HFT the cause of the “Flash Crash” in 2010 also?
       Comment by Ryan Marcum (@ryankmarcum) - April 3, 2014 at 4:09 pm
   125. I’m an equities and futures day trader, and can say I absolutely
       see the repercussions of the HFT bots in the markets. The
       strategies that used to work pre-2008 are now COMPLETELY OBSOLETE.
       The main way I make money trading stocks is by staying away from
       anything that averages over 10M shares a day. In the futures
       market, we have to make sure we only trade when there’s panic or
       extreme greed. Otherwise we’re just fighting algo’s, which is a
       losing battle every time.
       Mark, thanks for bringing this topic to light!

   126. I agree with Johan – I am not in a position to argue one way or
       the other, but I now know enough to pay attention of the direction
       of the conversation and change/manage my trading behavior
       accordingly, maybe? I hope?…

       This is one of the best blog posts I have read in a long time.
       IMHO, this post achieves 100% of it’s intended goal/purpose. Very
       informative and very, very clear (the ‘clear’ part is the one which
       is most difficult to achieve for any writer/expert).

       real market innovators…for society, it’s a tragic waste of talent.
       Comment by Dan Schmisseur - April 3, 2014 at 3:46 pm
   130. I think most of your points are on target. HFT is completely fair,
       legitimate, and legal. The investor with the fastest information
       has always had the advantage and this problem will never go away.
       There will likely always be a price you can pay to get faster
       information and “beat” the market. Nanex has covered a lot of the
       questionable things that have been done by high-frequency traders.
       There are many strange things that have occurred that have baffled
       even industry experts.
       I’m not sure how the SEC is going to apply their rules to an
       algorithm. Math and law don’t really correlate. Back-testing
       methods that “work” is creating algorithms that always beat the
       competition. How can the SEC be sure that an algorithm isn’t
       manipulative or deceptive?
       Regardless, I think they are here to stay. In a perfect work,
       high-frequency traders would comply with all rules and create a
       market that is so responsive that it’s impossible to cheat or
       “game” it. They are the final solution to our real-time markets of
       the future.
       Comment by Andrew Strubhar - April 3, 2014 at 3:45 pm
   131. Nice post. Question: If HFT causes most market participants to be
       worse off, why don’t the exchanges regulate it? Note that this
       could be limited to not providing the asymmetric advantages that
       you indicate accrue artificially to HFT.
