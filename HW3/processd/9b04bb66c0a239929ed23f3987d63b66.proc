Four Ways to Look at Global Carbon Footprints

   Fourteen nations and Europe account for about 80 percent of world
   greenhouse gas emissions.

Current Emissions

   (millions of metric tons)

   China is the world's top contibutor of greenhouse gases, followed by
   the United States.

Per Capita

   (metric tons per person)

   Countries with large populations, including fast-developing nations
   like India, have low emissions per person compared to many
   industrialized countries.

Intensity

   (metric tons per millions of dollars GDP)

   Energy efficiency has helped many developed nations reduce their
   greenhouse gas "intensity"—their emissions per unit of gross domestic
   product.

Cumulative Emissions

   (millions of metric tons)

   Measured from the year 1850, reflecting historical industrialization,
   the emissions of the United States and Europe far surpass those of
   other nations.

   About this graphic Graphics by Stephen Rountree and Adam Marr
   Source: World Resources Institute CAIT 2.0 climate data explorer
   Emissions data and national boundaries are from 2010. For current
   emissions, per capita emissions, and intensity, the data are measured
   in tons of "carbon dioxide equivalent." That is, they include carbon
   dioxide and five other greenhouse gases (methane, nitrous oxides,
   hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride) as
   measured by their global warming potential. Cumulative emissions are
   measured in tons of carbon dioxide only. The emissions of Brazil and
   Indonesia may be understated because the numbers do not include
   calculations on land use change and forestry. There are high
   uncertainties in current measures of deforestation's contribution to
   greenhouse gas emissions, as international authorities work to develop
   a consistent methodology.
   This original version of this graphic was developed for the
   International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, and was
   reprinted with its permission. Each of the four charts is scaled
   independently.
