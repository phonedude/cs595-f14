This is the right thing to do.

CVS/pharmacy will stop selling cigarettes and all tobacco products at its
more than 7,600 stores nationwide by October 1, 2014

   Ending the sale of cigarettes and tobacco products at CVS/pharmacy is
   simply the right thing to do for the good of our customers and our
   company. The sale of tobacco products is inconsistent with our purpose
   – helping people on their path to better health.

   As the delivery of health care evolves with an emphasis on better
   health outcomes, reducing chronic disease and controlling costs, CVS
   Caremark is playing an expanded role through our 26,000 pharmacists and
   nurse practitioners. By removing tobacco products from our retail
   shelves, we will better serve our patients, clients and health care
   providers while positioning CVS Caremark for future growth as a health
   care company. Cigarettes and tobacco products have no place in a
   setting where health care is delivered. This is the right thing to do.

   Larry Merlo, President and Chief Executive Officer

   Troy Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Medical Officer

   Helena Foulkes, Executive Vice President, CVS Caremark and President,
   CVS/pharmacy
