It’s now a crime to let your kid play alone at the park

   Earlier this month a South Carolina mom was put behind bars after being
   arrested for allegedly allowing her 9-year-old daughter to play at a
   park unsupervised by an adult. The girl was equipped with a cell phone
   and playing at a park near her mother’s place of work but this didn’t
   stop police from charging Debra Harrell of North Augusta with unlawful
   conduct toward a child. Now, Harrell’s daughter is in custody with the
   department of social services.

   The story has outraged many who think the authorities made a bad
   decision in taking a child away from a mother. Over at Slate, Jessica
   Grose writes:

     It angers me, as a citizen, to see the police overreach this way.
     How is it benefiting this child to be put in the custody of social
     services? And since I’m a parent, Harrell’s arrest scares me: How
     can I appropriately parent my child when doing something that seems
     relatively safe, if out of fashion, can get you arrested?

   I’m also angry. Putting a mother behind bars and taking away her child
   is far worse than allowing a child to play alone at a park. Harrell’s
   daughter was in very little danger at the park. Gosh, she could have
   broken an arm, and if she did Harrell says this was a busy park with at
   least 40 or more children and parents present at all times. I’m sure
   someone would have helped her. The absolute worst thing that could have
   happened is a kidnapping and the possibility of that occurring was next
   to none. I always love quoting the statistics gathered by Free-Range
   Kids author Lenore Skenazy who advocates for parents letting their kids
   do confidence-building activities like go to the park alone and says
   there’s a 1 in 1.5 million chance of a child being abducted. A family
   has been completely torn apart here on the off chance that this girl
   might have been abducted — that’s criminal.

   Harrell, 46, was in a tough situation. Harrell works at McDonald’s and
   at the start of summer she was bringing her daughter to work and
   keeping the child occupied with a laptop she saved up for. This plan
   stopped working after Harrell’s home was robbed and the laptop was
   stolen. Harrell’s daughter asked if she could play at the park adjacent
   to Walmart while her mother worked. The next day, Harrell dropped her
   child at the park with a cell phone. Her daughter returned the next day
   and then next but on the third day an adult asked where her mother was
   and when she responded at work, the police were called, according to
   WJBF-TV.

   Harrell’s financial situation hasn’t been revealed but she’s working at
   McDonald’s so it can be assumed that her salary likely doesn’t provide
   her with enough income to cover childcare in addition to housing and
   food. Rather than take away her daughter why didn’t authorities ask if
   they could find a way to help Harrell find childcare? I have a feeling
   this should have been treated as more of a child welfare matter than a
   crime.

   Harrell made the best possible decision for her daughter and that was
   to allow her to play at the nearby park. Actually, I think this was a
   much better decision than forcing her daughter to stay at home in front
   of a television. In fact, I would argue that allowing your kid to do
   things such as go to the park alone helps build self-reliance,
   confidence, responsibility, and decision-making skills. Most of today’s
   kids are raised in bubbles, always under their parents’ noses, and they
   never learn how to fend for themselves.

   Growing up in the 1980s, I was riding my bike to the park that was at
   least a mile from our house at age 7 or 8. I was always with a pack of
   kids and together we climbed trees, swung from the monkey bars, and
   slid down the twisty slides. Nobody ever got hurt or kidnapped. I did
   lose the top of my big toe once when I rode my bike with flip-flops,
   but it healed and I never did that again.

   My brother once broke his arm after falling from the top of a slide at
   a park, but my mom was there and saw the whole thing. I have a theory
   that kids become less cautious when their parents are present and when
   you give them freedom to do things on their own, they take extra
   special care of themselves because they’re aware that an adult isn’t
   present to help.

   Being taken away from your mother, this doesn’t build confidence. This
   only creates depressed, heart-broken children. I can only hope that the
   authorities sort this situation out and find a way to reunite Harrell
   with her daughter.
