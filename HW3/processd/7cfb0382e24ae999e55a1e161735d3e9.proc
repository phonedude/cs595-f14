Summary

   That’s it from me for today. Here is a summary of key events:

   • David Miranda has lost his high court appeal in which he had sought
   to establish that his nine-hour detention at Heathrow airport in August
   last year was unlawful and breached his right to freedom of expression.

   • The three judges admitted that the stop constituted an interference
   with press freedom – but said this was trumped by national security
   concerns.

   • Miranda, the partner of former Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald,
   one of the key reporters behind the first Edward Snowden leaks, has
   applied for permission to appeal to the court of appeal. But the court
   may decide not to allow him to appeal.

   • Numerous civil liberties and press freedom groups have spoken out
   against today’s decision.

   Thanks for all the comments.

   2.45pm GMT

   Antoine Héry of campaign group Reporters Without Borders said his group
   was appalled by the ruling.

     Once again, press freedom in the UK suffers from a confusion between
     journalism and terrorism by the authorities.

     It is a practice very well known and used in countries where
     authoritarian regimes are in power. It is a shame to say, but the
     United Kingdom has several times descended to that level in the past
     six months.

     The UK dropped 3 places in the 2014 edition of the World Press
     Freedom Index, and if nothing happens to protect the Guardian and
     its collaborators in the future, we are afraid that press freedom
     will be more and more seriously challenged in the country.

   2.43pm GMT

   Former Tory shadow home secretary David Davis MP has sent more on his
   reaction to the Miranda ruling:

     Today’s judgment in the high court in the case of the detention of
     David Miranda is to my mind disappointing. That the court has found
     that his detention “fell properly within schedule 7” [of the
     Terrorism Act 2000] is of concern as there can be no suggestion that
     Mr Miranda was a terrorist or that he was seeking to abet terrorism
     and it was for these purposes that this power was given to the
     police and the security agencies.

     As Lord Falconer, the former Labour lord chancellor, wrote last
     year: “Schedule 7 powers can only be used ‘for the purpose of
     determining’ whether the detained person is a terrorist.”

     When the 2000 Terrorism Act was debated, the House of Commons did
     not consider at all these powers would be used against journalists.

     Much less did it consider that it would be used dragnet-fashion –
     almost 70,000 times last year. I note that in his judgment Lord
     Justice Laws acknowledged that he accepted that “the schedule 7 stop
     constituted an indirect interference with press freedom” and that
     “the fact that the outcome of a schedule 7 examination is open-ended
     is (I think) of some importance”. These aspects of the judgment
     indicate that it is likely to be overturned by the supreme court and
     indeed the ECHR.

     This case is yet another example of heavy-handed overuse of
     terrorism powers that parliament entrusted the agencies with,
     notably stop and search, retention of DNA and the increasing mass
     storage of our metadata.

     We have to question whether these actions of government agencies are
     actually increasing the security of the British people more than
     they are undermining our traditional liberties.

   12.56pm GMT

   Robert Mahoney of the US-based Committee to Protect Journalists said
   today’s ruling risked “bracketing journalistic activity together with
   terrorism”.

     The judges themselves acknowledged that Miranda’s detention and the
     seizure of the journalistic material he was carrying was ‘an
     indirect interference with press freedom’. It would be unfortunate
     if it set a precedent.

   11.47am GMT

   Vincent Peyrègne of the World Association of Newspaper and News
   Publishers has said today’s ruling deals a “serious blow” to public
   interest journalism in the UK:

     With this ruling we’re even less likely to see the vital public
     debate - that has so far been lacking in the UK - into the nature of
     the Guardian’s revelations and what they mean for our society.

     The future of serious public interest journalism in the UK has been
     dealt a serious blow by the court’s refusal to recognise that
     journalists also have a vital role in defending democracy.

   11.46am GMT

   David Miranda has applied for permission to appeal to the court of
   appeal, his solicitors, Bindmans, have confirmed in a statement.

   Miranda’s solicitor Gwendolen Morgan, said:

     We look forward to the court of appeal considering the fundamentally
     important legal issues raised in our appeal in due course.

     Despite recognising that the proper functioning of a modern
     participatory democracy requires that the media be free, active,
     professional and enquiring, this judgment leaves little room for
     responsible investigative journalism which touches on national
     security issues.

     Journalism is currently at risk of being conflated with terrorism.
     Therefore, our client has no option but to appeal.

     In the meantime, whilst the courts consider our appeal, we
     understand that journalists are making alternative travel plans to
     safeguard their material, sources and confidential working systems
     when they have to travel via the UK.

     The government should be very concerned about this and the message
     it sends internationally.

   Bindmans added:

     The court also made some general observations, which journalists may
     welcome. Lord Justice Laws recognised that the protection of
     journalistic sources is one of the basic conditions for press
     freedom, that leaked or stolen material may need protection as
     journalistic material, and finally that non-journalists including
     cameramen, interpreters, and assistants may also need the law’s
     protection.

   11.38am GMT

Guardian statement

   A Guardian News & Media spokesperson said:

     We’re disappointed by today’s judgment, which means that an Act
     designed to defeat terrorism can now be used to catch those who are
     working on fundamentally important issues.

     The judgment takes a narrow view of what ‘journalism’ is in the 21st
     century and a very wide view of the definition of ‘terrorism’. We
     find that disturbing.

   Updated at 12.46pm GMT

   11.35am GMT

   Julian Smith MP added that Julian Huppert’s remarks (see earlier) were
   “a load of wishy washy Lib Dem rubbish. This guy apparently had our
   state secrets and agents on a games console.”

   11.29am GMT

   Julian Smith, the Conservative MP who has been a fierce critic of the
   Guardian since it began breaking the Snowden stories, said:

     This aways seemed a bizarre complaint for Mr Miranda to have made
     since he was transporting such sensitive information about our
     national security.

     Let’s hope the full truth about the risks to which he and the
     Guardian continue to expose the UK is now given the full focus it
     deserves. That is where there is a real legal case to be made.

   11.25am GMT

Summary

   Here’s a summary of what has happened this morning.

   • David Miranda has lost his high court appeal in which he had sought
   to establish that his nine-hour detention at Heathrow airport in August
   last year was unlawful and breached his right to freedom of expression.

   • The three judges admitted that the stop constituted an interference
   with press freedom – but said this was trumped by national security
   concerns.

   • Miranda, the partner of former Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald,
   one of the key reporters behind the first Edward Snowden leaks, has
   announced he will appeal. But the high court refused him permission to
   do so, meaning he must petition the court of appeal directly to hear
   the case. It may decide not to.

   11.16am GMT

   Michelle Stanistreet of the National Union of Journalists said Miranda
   was stopped as part of a “fishing expedition which had nothing to do
   with the prevention of terrorism”. She added:

     It is clear from the evidence presented to the court of appeal that
     even the Metropolitan police had doubts about the propriety of
     stopping and searching Mr Miranda.

     Today’s judgment represents a serious attack on press freedom and
     the protection of journalists’ sources. That can only limit the
     public’s right to know what is done in its name, and is a real
     threat to democracy.

     We believe there must be an urgent public inquiry into the use of
     anti-terrorism legislation as a battering ram against press freedom.

   11.15am GMT

   Nick Pickles of campaign group Big Brother Watch said:

     What is bizarre is that the security services twice declined to tell
     the police David Miranda was involved in terrorism, and then changed
     their mind after being told by the police that they could not use
     schedule 7 if he was not. This looks like making the facts up to fit
     the law, rather than using the appropriate power to do what was the
     ultimately goal, namely seizing the material in David Miranda’s
     possession.

     This is exactly why independent judicial oversight of terrorism
     powers is needed and parliament should revisit the legal framework.
     It is clearly remarkable for a British court to equate journalism
     with an act of terrorism and if the law is so vague as for that to
     be reasonable then it should be abundantly clear how badly in need
     of reform the law is.

   11.13am GMT

   Julian Huppert, a Liberal Democrat member of the home affairs select
   committee, said the judgment indicated that the problem was with the
   2000 Terrorism Act itself, which was clearly written in too broad a
   fashion, as with so much anti-terror legislation. “We have already made
   some changes to the law which are about to take effect, but I think
   there is still more to do,” he said.

   Updated at 11.14am GMT

   11.09am GMT

   Greenwald’s statement confirms that Miranda will appeal against the
   ruling “until the end if necessary – up to the highest UK court and
   then to the European Court of Human Rights”.

   10.56am GMT

   Greenwald also put out a statement via the Intercept, saying the UK had
   equated journalism with terrorism. He wrote:

     The UK government expressly argued that the release of the Snowden
     documents (which the free world calls “award-winningjournalism“) is
     actually tantamount to “terrorism”, the same theory now being used
     by the Egyptian military regime to prosecute Al Jazeera journalists
     as terrorists.

     Congratulations to the UK government on the illustrious company it
     is once again keeping.

     British officials have also repeatedly threatened criminal
     prosecution of everyone involved in this reporting, including
     Guardian journalists and editors ...

     The UK government routinely threatens newspapers with all sorts of
     sanctions for national security reporting it dislikes. Its Official
     ... Secrets Act makes it incredibly easy to prosecute journalists
     and others for disclosing anything which political officials want to
     keep secret.

     For that reason, it was able to force the Guardian to destroy its
     own computers containing Snowden material precisely because the
     paper’s editors knew that British courts would slavishly defer to
     any requests made by the GCHQ to shut down the paper’s reporting ...

   He attacked British political culture for clinging to “17th century
   feudal traditions” such as the monarchy and peerage, adding:

     That journalism disliked by the state can be actually deemed not
     just a crime but “terrorism” seems a natural by-product of this type
     of warped elite mindset, as does the fact that much of the British
     press led the way in demanding that the Guardian’s journalism be
     criminalised (not unlike how many members of the American media have
     become the most devoted defenders of the NSA and have taken the lead
     in demonising the journalistic transparency brought to that and
     other government agencies).

   He continued:

     As we made clear along ago, the obvious objective of these attacks -
     to intimidate the journalists working on this story and deter future
     disclosures - will remain completely unfulfilled.

     Since David’s detention and the destruction of the Guardian’s
     computers, there have been a spate of top secret GCHQ documents
     reported on and published around the world, many of which, to their
     credit, have been published by the Guardian.

   Updated at 11.07am GMT

   10.54am GMT

   In a statement published on Greenwald’s new website, The Intercept,
   Miranda said:

     I will appeal this ruling, and keep appealing until the end; not
     because I care about what the British government calls me, but
     because the values of press freedom that are at stake are too
     important to do anything but fight until the end.

     I’m of course not happy that a court has formally said that I was a
     legitimate terrorism suspect, but the days of the British Empire are
     long over, and this ruling will have no effect outside of the
     borders of this country.

     I’m convinced they’ve hurt their own country far more than me with
     this ruling, as it emphasises what the world already knows - the UK
     has contempt for basic press freedoms.

   He added:

     I am very proud of the work I did. In fact, in light of today’s
     decision equating journalism with terrorism, I am more certain than
     ever that I did the right thing, since governments like this really
     need transparency.

   10.52am GMT

   The Metropolitan police have also put out a statement welcoming the
   ruling. It reads:

     Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000 is a key part of our national
     security capability and a vital tool used by the police to help keep
     the public safe.

     The court upheld the relevant policies and practices of the police
     together with their implementation in this case. We are committed to
     ensuring these powers are used appropriately and proportionately.

     Our officers act in good faith when being called upon to make
     difficult decisions, often under great pressure.

     We carefully considered the use of schedule 7 in this case and our
     assessment was that the use of the power was legally and
     procedurally sound. We are pleased that the court recognised that
     “the schedule 7 stop was a proportionate measure in the
     circumstances, its objective was not only legitimate but very
     pressing”.

     There is a clear legal framework for the police to work within
     whilst protecting national security at UK borders. The powers are
     also subject to robust safeguards.

     All ports officers receive comprehensive training on use of powers
     under schedule 7 to ensure that they adhere to the Codes of Practice
     that accompany the legislation.

     Oversight of the use of schedule 7 is provided by the independent
     reviewer of counter-terrorism legislation, David Anderson QC.

     The MPS fully supports proposed changes to the legislation,
     currently being considered by parliament following a Home Office
     consultation on the use and scope of the power.

     The criminal investigation continues and therefore it would be
     inappropriate to comment any further at this stage.

   The police are investigating the material taken from Miranda at
   Heathrow and have said it may result in “some people” being found to
   have committed an offence

   Deputy Assistant Commissioner Helen Ball added:

     This was a very important case that has attracted considerable
     public attention. Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000 is vital in
     helping to keep the public safe. We are pleased that the court’s
     judgment states that “the stop was lawful; it was also on the
     evidence, a pressing imperative in the interests of national
     security”.

     Some commentators have characterised the stop as an attack on
     journalistic freedom; this was never the case. The judgment is a
     clear vindication of the officers’ conduct, demonstrating that they
     acted lawfully and in good faith throughout.

   10.46am GMT

   Home secretary Theresa May welcomed the ruling, saying:

     This judgment overwhelmingly supports the wholly proportionate
     action taken by the police in this case to protect national
     security.

     If the police believe any individual is in possession of
     highly-sensitive stolen information that would aid terrorism, then
     they should act. We are pleased that the court agrees.

     Although the courts have fully supported the use of schedule 7 in
     this case, we constantly work to ensure that our counter-terrorism
     powers are effective and fair. That is why parliament has recently
     approved further safeguards proposed by the government for the use
     of this essential border and ports security power.

     The police and our intelligence agencies do a vital and difficult
     job protecting our lives and freedoms from terrorists, serious
     criminals and hostile states. Their job has been made much harder as
     a result of intelligence leaks.

   10.44am GMT

   Lord Justice Laws said it was plain that the purpose of stopping Mr
   Miranda “was to ascertain the nature of the material he was carrying”
   and fell properly within schedule 7.

   Steven Kovats QC argued on behalf of the home secretary, Theresa May,
   that her national security duty to establish the nature of Miranda’s
   activity was “consistent” with use by the police of schedule 7.

   Agreeing, Lord Justice Laws said the schedule was “capable of covering
   the publication or threatened publication ... of stolen classified
   information which, if published, would reveal personal details of
   members of the armed forces or security and intelligence agencies,
   thereby endangering their lives.”

   10.38am GMT

   Alan Travis adds:

     Lord Justice Laws said he noted that the seized material included
     personal information that would allow staff to be identified,
     including those deployed overseas.

     Glenn Greenwald told the judges that the security services were well
     aware that the seized material was in connection with journalism and
     not terrorism.

     He said that there was no evidence to indicate that any disclosure
     had actually threatened or endangered life or any specific
     operation.

     “In my view, this is not surprising, given the care we took not to
     create such a risk,” he said in his witness statement. Miranda said
     the material was so heavily encrypted that he was unable to open it
     himself.

     But the judges dismissed Greenwald’s claims, saying there was “no
     perceptible foundation” for the suggestion that they were not
     putting national security or lives at risk by possessing the
     material.

     Laws accepted that agreeing not to publish material simply because a
     government official had said it might damage national security was
     antithetical to the most important traditions of responsible
     journalism – but said this was trivial compared with the threat to
     security.

     He went on to say that neither Greenwald nor Miranda was in a
     position to form an accurate judgment on the matter because that
     would depend on knowing the whole “jigsaw” of disparate pieces of
     intelligence.

     Laws said he had no reason to doubt any of the evidence from Oliver
     Robbins, the deputy national security adviser at the Cabinet Office,
     that the material was likely to cause very great damage to security
     interests and possible loss of life.

     “In my judgment the schedule 7 stop was a proportionate measure in
     the circumstances. Its objective was not only legitimate but very
     pressing,” he said.

     The judges also dismissed arguments from Liberty, the National Union
     Journalists, English PEN and others that the schedule 7 stop and
     search powers were arbitrary and lacked any safeguards or express
     protections for confidential journalist sources or materials.

     They said that a claim that there should have been prior approval by
     a judge was “pointless and ineffective”.

   Updated at 10.40am GMT

   10.36am GMT

   Gus Hosein of lobby group Privacy International said:

     Schedule 7 is a law intended to fight terrorism, and was not drafted
     to target people like David Miranda.

     In this instance however the government used it to seize the devices
     of journalists to intimidate the reporting of mass and unlawful
     surveillance practices of the British government.

     To equate journalism with espionage, as the government has, is truly
     shameful.

     Today the court endorsed the practice of arbitrary use of power —
     that anyone passing through the border, Briton or not, can be
     subjected to a search and their devices seized for whatever purpose
     the government sees fit.

   10.35am GMT

   Human rights pressure group Liberty said it had long argued that
   schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act was “over-broad ... ripe for misuse and
   discrimination”. It is currently challenging the powers at the ECHR.
   Rosie Brighouse, legal officer for Liberty, said of today’s ruling
   against Miranda:

     If such a barefaced abuse of power is lawful then the law must
     change. Miranda’s treatment showed schedule 7 for what it is: a
     chillingly over-broad power, routinely misused.

     People are held and interrogated for hours, their property
     confiscated while they’re swabbed for saliva – all without any
     suspicion that they’ve done anything wrong.

   Updated at 10.35am GMT

   10.33am GMT

   David Davis, the former Conservative shadow home secretary and
   campaigner on civil liberties issues, said:

     When parliament debated these laws in 2000 [the Terrorism Act] it
     did not consider at all these powers would be used against
     journalists.

     Much less did it consider that it would be used dragnet fashion –
     60,000 times a year [for schedule 7]. There can be no suggestion
     that Mr Miranda was a terrorist or that he was seeking to abet
     terrorism and it was for these purposes that this power was given to
     the police and the security agencies.

     Clearly parliament has to look at the powers it has given these
     agencies since as with a number of other counter-terrorism powers it
     has been misused and over used. I suspect the supreme court and and
     the ECHR [European court of human rights] will overturn this
     judgment.

   Updated at 12.41pm GMT

   10.24am GMT

   Here is the ruling in full.

   More details soon ...

   10.15am GMT

   Peter Noorlander of the Media Legal Defence Initiative said:

     The court has failed to recognise that David Miranda and other
     journalists have played a crucial role in uncovering an
     international system of state surveillance that encompasses the
     entire world and is arguably unlawful. This would not have come to
     light without them. Their journalism deserves protection, and this
     judgment fails to provide it.

   10.15am GMT

   Tom Hughes of Article 19 said:

     The Guardian’s reporting has revealed programmes of mass
     surveillance allowing security agencies around the world to spy on
     the internet and mobile phone use of millions of people. This lack
     of effective democratic oversight for these programmes is a story of
     international public interest. Worryingly, today’s judgment suggests
     that the law fails to give sufficient protection to serious public
     interest journalism, such as this, and risks dangerously devaluing
     the important role of the media in a democratic society.

   10.15am GMT

   The three groups also put out individual statements on the ruling.

   Jo Glanville of English PEN said:

     The Snowden leaks are one of the most important public interest
     stories of recent years. The court’s dismissal of the case may
     discourage both whistleblowers and journalists from covering similar
     news stories in the future, and undermines the media’s essential
     role as a watchdog in our democracy.

   10.14am GMT

   Lobby groups Article 19, English PEN and Media Legal Defence Initiative
   have put out a joint statement expressing their disappointment with the
   Miranda ruling. They said:

     As organisations that work to defend the right to freedom of
     expression in the UK and around the world, we intervened in the case
     as third parties since we believed that the detention of David
     Miranda under schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act and the retention of
     his property, including sensitive journalistic materials, was a
     disproportionate interference with his right to freedom of
     expression.

     Miranda was assisting his partner Glenn Greenwald in his reporting
     for the Guardian of the revelations regarding the NSA’s and GCHQ’s
     surveillance programmes, a continuing story of national and
     international importance that is clearly in the public interest. The
     stopping of an individual assisting the reporting of the story, and
     the seizure of their materials, has profound implications for press
     freedom in the United Kingdom.

     While the court recognises the substantial importance of the issues
     raised by the case, the judgment will expose any journalist covering
     a story on national security, who passes through a port in the UK,
     to being detained under schedule 7 and having their sources or
     material seized. It therefore threatens to undermine protections for
     journalists that are recognised in international law and may deter
     future sources from providing information to the media in the public
     interest.

     We are equally disappointed with the statements of the court
     regarding the role of journalists in a liberal democracy. In
     particular, the judgment questions the media’s authority to decide
     on publishing material relating to national security, stating that
     this is a constitutional role reserved for governments. We believe
     that this would limit journalists’ ability to cover stories of the
     greatest national importance and public interest.

   Lobby group Index on Censorship expressed disappointment at the high
   court’s dismissal of David Miranda’s application for a judicial review
   of the use of anti-terror laws to detain him at Heathrow airport. Chief
   executive Kirsty Hughes said:

     This ruling represents a dangerous elision of terrorist activity and
     legitimate journalistic practice. We must hope that it will not
     stand as precedent, as it could seriously endanger journalists
     working in the public interest.

   10.08am GMT

   Alan Travis has more:

     The ruling says that Miranda was stopped in transit as he headed to
     Rio de Janeiro from Berlin, where he was to meet the film-maker
     Laura Poitras, who had been involved in breaking disclosures based
     on documents leaked by the US National Security Agency contractor,
     Edward Snowden.

     Miranda was carrying encrypted files, including an external hard
     drive containing 58,000 highly classified UK intelligence documents,
     “in order to assist the journalistic activity of Greenwald”.

High court dismisses Miranda challenge

   David Miranda’s claim that he was unlawfully detained under
   counter-terrorism powers for nine hours at Heathrow airport last August
   has been dismissed.

   The judges said they accepted that the detention of Miranda and the
   seizure of computer material was “an indirect interference with press
   freedom” but they said this was justified by legitimate and “very
   pressing” interests of national security.

   The three judges, Lord Justice Laws, Mr Justice Ouseley and Mr Justice
   Openshaw, concluded that Miranda’s detention at Heathrow under schedule
   7 of the Terrorism 2000 Act was lawful, proportionate and did not
   breach the European human rights protections of freedom of expression.

   More details soon ...

   9.16am GMT

   David Miranda was questioned under schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act
   2000. Here is the full text of that schedule.

   This is what it says about who can be detained under these powers:

     2 (1) An examining officer may question a person to whom this
     paragraph applies for the purpose of determining whether he appears
     to be a person falling within section 40(1)(b).

     (2) This paragraph applies to a person if—

     (a) he is at a port or in the border area, and

     (b) the examining officer believes that the person’s presence at the
     port or in the area is connected with his entering or leaving Great
     Britain or Northern Ireland [F1 or his travelling by air within
     Great Britain or within Northern Ireland].

     (3) This paragraph also applies to a person on a ship or aircraft
     which has arrived [F2 at any place in Great Britain or Northern
     Ireland (whether from within or outside Great Britain or Northern
     Ireland).]

     (4) An examining officer may exercise his powers under this
     paragraph whether or not he has grounds for suspecting that a person
     falls within section 40(1)(b).

     3 An examining officer may question a person who is in the border
     area for the purpose of determining whether his presence in the area
     is connected with his entering or leaving Northern Ireland.

     4 (1) A place in Northern Ireland is within the border area for the
     purposes of paragraphs 2 and 3 if it is no more than one mile from
     the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.

     (2) If a train goes from the Republic of Ireland to Northern
     Ireland, the first place in Northern Ireland at which it stops for
     the purpose of allowing passengers to leave is within the border
     area for the purposes of paragraphs 2 and 3.

     5 A person who is questioned under paragraph 2 or 3 must—

     (a) give the examining officer any information in his possession
     which the officer requests;

     (b) give the examining officer on request either a valid passport
     which includes a photograph or another document which establishes
     his identity;

     (c) declare whether he has with him documents of a kind specified by
     the examining officer;

     (d) give the examining officer on request any document which he has
     with him and which is of a kind specified by the officer.

     6 (1) For the purposes of exercising a power under paragraph 2 or 3
     an examining officer may—

     (a) stop a person or vehicle;

     (b) detain a person.

     (2) For the purpose of detaining a person under this paragraph, an
     examining officer may authorise the person’s removal from a ship,
     aircraft or vehicle.

     (3) Where a person is detained under this paragraph the provisions
     of Part I of Schedule 8 (treatment) shall apply.

     (4) A person detained under this paragraph shall (unless detained
     under any other power) be released not later than the end of the
     period of nine hours beginning with the time when his examination
     begins.

   The reference to section 40(1)(b) is to another part of the Act which
   explains what “terrorist” means in this context. It reads:

     40 Terrorist: interpretation.

     (1) In this Part “terrorist” means a person who—

     (a) has committed an offence under any of sections 11, 12, 15 to 18,
     54 and 56 to 63, or

     (b) is or has been concerned in the commission, preparation or
     instigation of acts of terrorism.

     (2) The reference in subsection (1)(b) to a person who has been
     concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of
     terrorism includes a reference to a person who has been, whether
     before or after the passing of this Act, concerned in the
     commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism within
     the meaning given by section 1.

   Here Alan Travis summarises schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act:

     The schedule 7 powers are extremely widely drawn, allowing police to
     stop and detain individuals for up to nine hours to determine
     whether they appear to be involved in terrorism.

     There is no need for the officers to have any grounds to suspect the
     person stopped is involved in terrorism or any other criminal
     activity. There is no right to silence.

   Good morning.

   At 10am David Miranda is due to find out the result of his high court
   claim that his detention at Heathrow airport last August was unlawful
   and undermined his freedom of expression.

   Miranda is the partner of former Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald,
   who was one of the paper’s key team reporting the initial leaks from
   NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden.

   He was held and questioned for nine hours on Sunday 18 August 2013
   under schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000. In November his lawyers
   argued that his detention for the maximum period allowed was a misuse
   of schedule 7 and breached his human rights.
   Miranda had nine items, including his laptop, mobile phone, memory
   cards and DVDs, taken from him while detained.
   He was stopped while changing planes on a journey from Berlin to Rio de
   Janeiro, where he lives with Greenwald. In Berlin he was visiting Laura
   Poitras, a filmmaker who had also worked with the Guardian on the first
   Snowden revelations.
   Before his high court challenge in November, judges ruled that the
   material seized from him could only be examined for national security
   purposes and the protection of the public, and no other.
   Miranda’s legal action was against the home secretary and the
   commissioner of the Metropolitan police.
   At the high court, lawyers for the Home Office argued that schedule 7
   of the Terrorism Act was “surely also capable of covering the
   publication, or threatened publication, of stolen classified
   information which, if published, would reveal personal details of
   members of the armed forces or security and intelligence services
   thereby endangering their lives where that publication or threatened
   publication is designed to influence government policy on the
   activities of the security and intelligence agencies”.
   Steven Kovats QC, for the home secretary, said that if publication of
   material obtained by Snowden was capable of being an act of terrorism –
   and the home secretary “submits that it is” – then “seeking to
   establish the nature of the claimant’s activity” was both meeting the
   home secretary’s national security duty and discharging the police’s
   schedule 7 function “of seeking to determine whether the claimant was
   or appeared to be a person who was or had been concerned in the
   commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism”.

   Home Office lawyers also argued that border controls existed to check
   on travellers where there was insufficient information to justify an
   arrest.
   Lawyers for the Metropolitan police said they had “legitimate” concerns
   about how the encrypted material Miranda was carrying had been
   “arranged” as they feared all of the Snowden material could be
   released, endangering lives.
   Miranda’s lawyers argued that counter-terrorism powers under schedule 7
   to the act should not have been used, insisted Miranda was not involved
   in terrorism and said that his right to freedom of expression was
   curtailed.
   Lord Justice Laws, Mr Justice Ouseley and Mr Justice Openshaw also
   heard arguments about what constitutes journalistic material under
   recent court precedents and whether all documents handed over would
   have specific protection.

   Matthew Ryder QC, for Miranda, told the judges:

     This claim is about the use of counter-terrorism powers, that can
     only be used at ports and airports, to seize journalistic material.

   The “dominant purpose” of the examining officers was not to determine
   whether he was a person involved in the commission, instigation or
   preparation of acts of terrorism, but to “assist the Security Service
   [MI5] in accessing material in the claimant’s possession”, Ryder said.

   This was also a “disproportionate interference with his right to
   freedom of expression”.
   I’ll cover the result live as it happens here.
