Digital Transformation Review n° 6

   Share:

Crafting a Compelling Digital Customer Experience

   It is the age of the digital customer. And digital customer experience
   is something that most companies have on top of their agenda. It is not
   hard to see why. In a survey, 70% of respondents said that good service
   had a considerable influence on their loyalty and 69% would recommend
   the company to others[1]. The reverse is also true. Poor customer
   experience drives customers away. Research shows that nearly 89% of
   customers walk away from a company after a single poor customer
   experience[2]. And this can have a significant impact. Businesses are
   estimated to lose as much as 20% of revenue from poor customer
   experiences[3]. And this is precisely the reason we chose to focus the
   sixth edition of our Digital Transformation Review on Customer
   Experience. How can organizations create compelling digital customer
   experiences that work? We posed this very question to a diverse panel
   from around the world. Our panel for this edition includes industry
   leaders, academics, startup founders, platform vendors and technology
   gurus. They come from all over the world, including the home of
   innovation in the digital age — Silicon Valley
