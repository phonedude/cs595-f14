Virus from Siberian permafrost revived

   Rebirth of 30,000-year-old virus suggests more, possibly harmful ones,
   could emerge in global warming, Arctic drilling

   French scientists have revived a giant virus that had been locked in
   the Siberian permafrost for more than 30,000 years, a breakthrough that
   may serve as a warning that long-dormant, possibly harmful pathogens in
   frozen soil could be revived by Arctic drilling and global warming.

   The scientists thawed the virus, Pithovirus sibericum, and watched it
   replicate in a culture in a petri dish, where it infected an amoeba, a
   simple single-cell organism, according to a study published Monday in
   the U.S. journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

   The study’s lead author told The Los Angeles Times that the discovery
   proves “that we could eventually resurrect active infectious viruses
   from different periods.”

   “We know that those nondangerous viruses are alive there, which
   probably is telling us that the dangerous kind that may infect humans
   and animals — that we think were eradicated from the surface of earth —
   are actually still present and eventually viable, in the ground,” said
   microbiologist Jean-Michel Claverie of Aix-Marseille University in
   France.

   The work detailed in the article shows that viruses can survive being
   locked up in the permafrost for extremely long periods, according to a
   statement released by France's National Center for Scientific Research.

   "It has important implications for public-health risks in connection
   with exploiting mineral or energy resources in Arctic Circle regions
   that are becoming more and more accessible through global warming," it
   said.

   "The revival of viruses that are considered to have been eradicated,
   such as the smallpox virus, whose replication process is similar to
   that of Pithovirus, is no longer limited to science fiction,” the
   statement continued. "The risk that this scenario could happen in real
   life has to be viewed realistically."

   Scientists found the virus in a 98-foot-deep sample of permanently
   frozen soil taken from coastal tundra in Chukotka, near the East
   Siberian Sea, where the average annual temperature is minus 7.8 degrees
   Fahrenheit.

   Radiocarbon dating of the soil sample found that vegetation grew in the
   area more than 30,000 years ago, when mammoths and Neanderthals walked
   the earth.

   P. sibericum is, on the scale of viruses, a giant. It has 500 genes,
   whereas a flu virus has eight. It is the first in a new category of
   viral whoppers, a family known as Megaviridae, for which two other
   categories already exist.

   The revived virus gets its name from "pithos," the ancient Greek word
   for "jar," since it has an amphora shape. It is so big that scientists
   can see it using optical microscopes rather than the more powerful
   electron microscopes usually needed.

   Unlike flu viruses, P. sibericum is harmless to humans and animals
   because it infects only a type of amoeba called Acanthamoeba, the
   researchers said.
