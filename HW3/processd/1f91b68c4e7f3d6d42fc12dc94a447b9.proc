App Helps Boston Parents Track School Buses through Blizzards

The Where's My School Bus app allows parents to track a student's school bus
through their smartphone.

   Not knowing where a child is can be harrowing for a parent. Not knowing
   where a child is in a blizzard can be even more frightening.

   This was the situation Boston Public Schools (BPS) found themselves in
   during the winter of 2010 when the East Coast was rocked by a series of
   snowstorms that cut power to hundreds of thousands and delayed school
   buses for hours. The series of storms, labeled “Snowmaggedon”, left an
   indelible impression on the school system that later turned into a call
   to action.

   Chris Osgood, co-chair of the Boston Mayor’s Office of New Urban
   Mechanics, explained to Government Technology that the city's
   experience during the storms led to the creation of a mobile app for
   parents called Where’s My School Bus?, that rapidly and securely relays
   student bus locations to parents. The app came about with the help of
   Boston's 2011 Code for America (CfA) fellowship, a program designed by
   the civic tech organization to outfit municipalities with technical
   support for IT improvement projects.

   Boston CfA fellow Joel Mahoney said the team’s first task was to triage
   the city’s needs and pair the highest priority needs with possible tech
   solutions. This analysis put parent and student travel communication at
   the top of the list.

   “The idea was to take this very complex but repetitive process and be
   able to answer that question, ‘Where’s my child?’” Mahoney said.

   The essential challenge, Mahoney explained was to automate a series of
   tasks: transportation staff authenticating a parent’s identity, finding
   a child in the school’s database, locating that student’s ID number,
   locating the appropriate bus using GPS, and last, relaying that bus
   location to the parent.

   It was a labor-intensive process, Mahoney said. Considering the limited
   amounts of staff and phone lines, it was nearly impossible to complete
   when multiplied by hundreds of callers per hour.

Data Security Concerns

   After a collaborative brainstorming process between the city and the
   CfA team, a proposal for the app was sent to BPS for the go-ahead.
   While the green light did eventually come, it wouldn’t be until the app
   had been well vetted and fears around data security were addressed.

   Scott Silverman, a CfA designer within the fellowship and currently an
   interaction designer at Airbnb, said school officials raised
   significant concerns about the app.

   “There was a lot of concern coming from many different angles, a lot of
   privacy, security and regulatory concerns,” Silverman said.

   BPS leaders loved the concept of the app and understood the need for
   it; however, Silverman said there were fears the app may be hacked and
   its sensitive data, including the identity and location of minors,
   could be stolen and misused. BPS also worried that the app would be too
   unwieldy for IT staff to install and manage.

   “The point that we were trying to get across ... was you can have
   highly sensitive data and you can have a highly secure and private way
   of making that data available to just the right people,” Silverman
   said.

   “Not only did we create greater efficiency and access to this data but
   we also improved security behind it … putting the data behind a
   firewall with a username and a password that could only be
   authenticated by the parent.”

   Convinced that the app could be secure, BPS officials consented and an
   initial version was created in the course of a weekend. Later, after
   some tinkering, the app would launch as an official pilot app for
   parents.

Polishing the Product

   Since the app's successful launch, Osgood reported that it’s garnered
   acclaim from parents and been fully embraced by Boston and BPS as a
   whole. According to Osgood, only a year after the pilot was released,
   the city and BPS invested $25,000 in a contract with Boston development
   firm Vermonster, to enhance the app further with a more user-friendly
   interface and an easier sign-on method for parents. Plans are now under
   way to enhance the app further with travel time estimates.

   Officials report more than 1,000 uses of the app per day, a number that
   Osgood calls significant.

   Mahoney and Silverman report that validation for the open source app
   has also come from the commercial market. Zonar, the GPS provider for
   BPS buses, has since released its own version of the Where’s My School
   Bus app called ZPass+ that has been used in the Freeport School
   District of Sarver, Pa., and others.

   "I think that's incredibly validating. I think it's exciting and I
   think it proves the point that there is a real need for this type of
   service,” Silverman said of ZPass+.

   As for Boston and its schools, Osgood said stakeholders are pleased to
   be providing a useful service to parents which grants them peace of
   mind and helps avoid long and frigid waits at bus stops.

   “Our hope for parents is that in a small way this is making their
   day-to-day experience better, and over time, making it even easier to
   engage with the district as a whole,” Osgood said.
