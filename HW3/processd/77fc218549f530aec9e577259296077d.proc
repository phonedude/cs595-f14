What Is Public?

It’s so simple, right?
     __________________________________________________________________

   Someone could make off with all your garbage that’s put out on the
   street, and carefully record how many used condoms or pregnancy tests
   or discarded pill bottles are in the trash, and then post that
   information up on the web along with your name and your address.
   There’s probably no law against it in your area. Trash on the curb is
   public.

   If an addiction recovery group decided to take advantage of the summer
   weather by meeting in a park across the street instead of their usual
   church basement, you could record the entire conversation and post it,
   along with photos of the group’s members, on the Internet in real time.
   You could tag it with the names of their employers, friends and family
   members, to make sure no one missed it. Conversations that take place
   in public parks are public.

   A stranger could park a drone with a webcam outside your window and
   live-stream video footage from inside your house to the world, complete
   with sound. In fact, it’s probably not illegal. The view from the
   street is public.

   There’s no real restriction preventing Google from popping up your home
   address, likely place of work, a recent photo, and accurate political
   donation data when someone searches for your name. Public data is
   public.

   You can talk to your friends about an issue in your life, even exposing
   information about how you’re vulnerable or affected by a circumstance.
   And if that conversation with friends happens to occur online, various
   publishers might capture it, remove it from its context, attach it to
   your real name, mention your employer or other affiliations, and then
   build their own narrative around it without your consent. Because
   social media is public.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Public is not simply defined. Public is not just what can be viewed by
   others, but a fragile set of social conventions about what behaviors
   are acceptable and appropriate. There are people determined to profit
   from expanding and redefining what’s public, working to treat nearly
   everything we say or do as a public work they can exploit. They may
   succeed before we even put up a fight.

We are all public defenders.

   Oh, we love “public”. From public schools to public servants, we are
   all public defenders.

   In popular discourse, most debate assumes either you are doing
   something that is public, or you are not. But in reality, the vast
   majority of what we do exists on a continuum that is neither clearly
   public nor strictly private. So why do we get this disconnect between
   rhetoric and reality? Because there are two communities keenly
   interested in reducing the complexity of publicness:
     * The media industry benefits from things that are in a gray area
       being treated as “public”, because this makes it (at best) fair
       game for discussion or (at worst) raw materials to feed the
       insatiable need for new content.
     * The technology industry benefits from treating “public” as a binary
       state because handling more complex forms of privacy can be more
       expensive to accommodate in software, and because tech companies
       increasingly rely on the same advertising model which supports
       media, where public information is more valuable because it can be
       monetized.

   These two powerful industries are enabled by a third: Policy. Policy
   makers and regulators are the only remaining group that could
   significantly affect the definition of what’s “public”. Thus far they,
   like all of society, have chosen to ignore the fact that our laws are
   wildly out of date in this regard. Everything from harassment laws to
   copyright battles to judicial decisions around privacy are all grounded
   in pre-Internet criteria of what constitutes public behavior or a
   public person. But educating lawmakers about the new, complex world of
   what’s public would be expensive, especially since it would be a battle
   against the combined force of the technology and media industries.

   It’s no wonder that voices arguing for a more complex, nuanced
   definition of “public” aren’t being heard.

The Public vs. Media

   Recent months have provided no shortage of reductive
   oversimplifications of “public”, usually voiced as condescending
   scolding. Some examples, based on an appealing-but-wrongheaded
   interpretation of social networking activity:

   Hamilton Nolan, Gawker:

     The things you write on Twitter are public. They are published on
     the world wide web. They can be read almost instantly by anyone with
     an internet connection on the planet Earth. This is not a bug in
     Twitter; it is a feature. Twitter is a thing that allows you to
     publish things, quickly, to the public.

   Conveniently omitted in these articles is a definition of the word
   “public” in this context. Because in both cases what the author means
   by public is “suitable for use as a hook for this article”.

   IFRAME: /media/ed3bdb0f05d52bc14eb43ff08892415b?maxWidth=700

   Jason Calacanis, CEO and publisher of Inside, makes explicit that
   appropriation of social media conversations by corporations for profit
   happens without consent.

   It has so quickly become acceptable practice within mainstream web
   publishing companies to reuse people’s tweets as the substance of an
   article that special tools have sprung up to help them do so. But
   inside these newsrooms, there is no apparent debate over whether it’s
   any different to embed a tweet from the President of the United States
   or from a vulnerable young activist who might not have anticipated her
   words being attached to her real identity, where she can be targeted by
   anonymous harassers.

   What if the public speech on Facebook and Twitter is more akin to a
   conversation happening between two people at a restaurant? Or two
   people speaking quietly at home, albeit near a window that happens to
   be open to the street? And if more than a billion people are active on
   various social networking applications each week, are we saying that
   there are now a billion public figures? When did we agree to let media
   redefine everyone who uses social networks as fair game, with no
   recourse and no framework for consent?

     The same public sharing that constitutes investigative journalism
     against a politician can be destructive and demeaning harassment
     against ordinary citizens.

   The conventional wisdom is “Don’t publish anything on social media that
   you wouldn’t want to see on the front page of the newspaper.” But this
   is an absurd and impossible standard. The same tools are being used for
   person-to-person conversations and for making grand pronouncements to
   the world, often by the same person at different times. Would we say
   “Don’t write anything in a sealed letter that you don’t want to see on
   the front page of the newspaper” simply because the technology exists
   to read that letter without opening it?

   Most media outlets routinely take semi-public, gray-area conversations,
   and the information implicitly or explicitly revealed in them, and
   consider them to be fodder, with no need for approval from the creators
   of the messages. We see the exact same behavior happening from online
   harassers and activists, both of whom have a name for the act: doxxing.

   The phenomenon of doxxing (revealing personal information about a
   person online) has made clear that public information exists in a
   context of power and consent, and we must construct our ethics in that
   context. We can’t do that if we are still pretending that taking
   information that was merely available and instead making it easily
   accessible is an act without any moral or ethical consequences.

The Public vs. Tech

   Programmers and engineers who create software with controls for privacy
   have moved in recent years to an on/off model where content is either
   viewable to the entire world or only to a list of people whom a user
   identifies as “friends”. Obviously, reducing public status to a binary
   consideration is convenient for a medium where everything must
   ultimately be represented in binary code. But we can’t let society’s
   norms be defined by which features are least expensive for storing on a
   database server in the cloud.

   At a deeper level, we have not reckoned with the fact that technology
   can make public things that were private in the past. The most common
   way this happens is because social networks like Facebook change their
   privacy controls unilaterally over time, making information that used
   to be private suddenly become public.

   While it’s usually discussed as a matter of changing privacy settings
   on Facebook, it’s important to note that the company is also redefining
   what public means on an ongoing basis. Indeed, the most consistent
   efforts Facebook has put into its Terms of Service changes over the
   past several years have been about cementing their ability to
   unilaterally make such changes while eliminating methods of recourse
   for users, such as prohibiting class action suits from being filed
   against the company.

   But there’s another, more subtle, way in which the big technology
   companies are making formerly-private actions public. Because so many
   processes that used to happen in phone calls or on paper have now moved
   to digital systems that are connected to the Internet, many actions
   have become much more tangible and detailed.

   Many smartphone users don’t realize that the photos they take often
   include the user’s geographic location hidden in the image. A regular
   user of a smartphone photo-sharing app who thinks she’s merely
   revealing her fondness for latte art may not realize that she’s
   providing a clear map of her exact location, stamped with the date and
   time accurate down to the second. By the standards of contemporary tech
   and media companies, displaying this information to the world in the
   form of “Here is a map showing where this person is every Tuesday at
   9am ” is a perfectly acceptable thing to publish about hundreds of
   millions of people, without their consent, because these companies
   consider this information public.

   This isn’t a theoretical concern — I’m cofounder of a company that
   gathers and analyzes a lot of social media data for users of our
   product. Even as a tiny startup, choosing not to publish user
   information that’s technically public can directly impact how many new
   users sign up and how much existing users come back to use the service.
   When we imagine those impacts for services that have hundreds of
   millions of users, when a tiny percentage increase in these metrics
   could materially impact what they report to shareholders, it’s easy to
   understand how the giant technology companies make their decisions.

The Public vs. Policy

   Given that both the media and the tech industry have been claiming for
   years that “public” is a clear-cut, resolved concept, it is no surprise
   that government officials have believed them. Agencies, legislators and
   regulators aren’t going to proactively stir up the pot over such an
   esoteric concept.

   Clearly, one reason law has stayed out of date in regard to what’s
   public is because two of our biggest industries profit from that
   anachronism. But another key reason is because a creeping expansion of
   what’s considered public enables one of the most effective tools for
   expanding the power of the state: surveillance.

   Advancing technologies have made it cheaper than ever to harvest
   enormous quantities of data about nearly everyone. Much has rightly
   been written about the NSA’s monitoring of citizens, but precious
   little attention has been paid to the fact that their monitoring was
   made easy because tech companies routinely record everything that they
   can about the actions, activity and communications of the people who
   use their services. By continuing to stretch the definition of what’s
   public, and to expand the realm of what’s considered acceptable use of
   public information, we enable a pervasive surveillance culture.

Public Secrets

   We’ve spent so many years being indoctrinated in this new, false
   definition of what is public that most people will still not concede
   that there is any complexity to the issue.

   Users of social media are commonly portrayed as preening, self-absorbed
   wanna-be celebrities, so there is always an audience who will delight
   when those on social media are “punished” by having their words or
   actions used to shame or embarrass them in public. Even more
   kindhearted souls can find it seductively appealing to adopt the
   seemingly-straightforward logic of “if it’s visible online, it must be
   completely public”.

   There are a lot of behaviors that are not entirely illegal that are
   profoundly destructive to an individual’s life, or to society’s fabric.
   Relying on legalistic definitions of “public” would only make sense if
   our legal system were thoughtful and current in its definition of the
   concept.

   Yet the last, loudest argument of the apologists for abusive
   exploitation of nominally public information is that “it’s technically
   legal!” It is, in fact, usually completely legal to be a total asshole
   about other people’s activity in “public” places. In fact, very few
   forms of harassment fall under the narrow confines of what legally
   constitutes harassment.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ultimately, we rely on a set of unspoken social agreements to make it
   possible to live in public and semi-public spaces. If we vent about our
   bosses to a friend at a coffee shop, we’re trusting that no one will
   run in with a camera crew and put that conversation on national TV.

   And similarly, in a personal dialogue with friends online, any of us
   might throw in a hashtag to gather our thoughts or indicate that
   there’s a larger context to an issue being discussed. But as we’ve seen
   with moments such as #yesallwomen, what starts as a conversation
   between friends or within a community can grow to be both expanded and
   exploited without the consent of its creator.

   When people, especially those in marginalized communities, have
   conversations with one another online, the fact that it’s possible to
   view those conversations might make them “public” by some definition.
   But certainly we can’t concede that every utterance we make in the
   presence of others is automatically fodder for aggregation and
   monetization by media and tech companies, without our consent or even
   the opportunity for remuneration. But while the ethical issues of, for
   example, outing victims of sexual assault in a media story without
   their consent has been discussed, there are far less dramatic
   circumstances that should still be raising questions. In the rare cases
   when these issues are discussed, the framing predictably becomes about
   a definition of “private”, rather than what our obligations are around
   something that is public.

   The business models of some of the most powerful forces in society are
   increasingly dependent on our complicity in making our conversations,
   our creations, and our communities public whenever they can exploit
   them. Given that reality, understanding exactly what “public” means is
   the only way to protect the public’s interest.
