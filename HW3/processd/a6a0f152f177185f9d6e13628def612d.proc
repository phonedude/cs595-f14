White House in no mood to debate big data and privacy at MIT

   The White House says it wants a spirited debate about the benefits and
   risks of large-scale data collection. But the government officials who
   showed up at MIT Monday to kick off a 90-day federal review of big data
   and privacy displayed little appetite for substantive conversation.

   The kicker came during an afternoon panel discussion, when John DeLong,
   the National Security Agency’s director of compliance, should have been
   awarded an honorary degree in tongue biting. DeLong sat right next to
   Carol Rose, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of
   Massachusetts, yet refused to engage when she made pointed comments,
   like this one: “Everything’s being done in secret. But for Edward
   Snowden, we wouldn’t even be having this conversation.”

   DeLong would look down and away (perhaps there was an interesting piece
   of metatada on the floor of Wong Auditorium), waiting silently for
   another panelist to move the discussion away from his agency.

   It wasn’t just him, either. Before DeLong’s group took the floor, US
   Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker made a brief speech in which she
   barely touched on the subject of privacy, then exited quickly without
   fielding questions.

   Someone seated near me, in one of those fake whispers that’s really
   meant to be heard by a lot of people, summed things up nicely: “No
   questions? Why have a real discussion, right?”

   Snickers rippled a few rows in every direction.

   Monday’s event was the start of a big data and privacy review President
   Obama outlined in January, in the same speech in which he announced new
   limits on NSA phone surveillance. The review, led by White House
   counselor John Podesta (who delivered bland remarks by phone from
   Washington), is not confined to intelligence gathering but is meant
   also to examine how private entities collect and use mass quantities of
   personal information, such as health records and Internet browsing
   habits.

   On the latter subject, the conversation was robust. Experts from places
   like MIT, Harvard, Nielsen, and Koa Labs traded pros and cons, and
   proposed high-tech compromises that could allow people to contribute
   personal information to big data pools anonymously. If you’re into
   cryptography and want the details, you can watch the whole thing here.

   Just don’t bother looking for deep thoughts from federal officials. You
   won’t find any.

   Maybe they’ll start participating in their own review at NYU or
   Berkeley. Those are the other two stops on a tour where, so far,
   participants appear to be taking privacy seriously only when it comes
   to their own opinions.

   MIT spinout Superpedestrian has added $4 million, including investments
   from actor Jared Leto and General Catalyst Partners, to produce its
   wheel that converts bicycles into electric-hybrids for easier
   hill-climbing and long-distance rides.

   “What we need are manufacturing jobs, not stupid social apps.”

   That was a comment appended to a column I wrote in August about two app
   start-ups in Boston, and I thought it raised a good question: Who is
   creating those new manufacturing jobs? If you want to weld, rivet, or
   stamp for a living, rather than code and upload, where will you work?

   Throughout his talk at the EmTech MIT conference today, Boston Dynamics
   chief executive Marc Raibert carefully avoided mentioning the
   robotic-elephant in the room — Google, which just so happens to own his
   company.

   One hurdle to the large-scale adoption of renewable wind and solar
   energy is that storing the juice—capturing energy collected during
   sunny, windy times, to be used when the sun sets or when the gusts
   die down—is a challenge. Read More

   Astro Teller, chief—no, Captain of Moonshots—at Google's secretive
   skunkworks shared some behind-the-scenes info about the Google's
   incubation zone for Really Crazy Ideas. It makes sense for Google to

   Jason Pontin, editor in chief at MIT Technology Review, at the
