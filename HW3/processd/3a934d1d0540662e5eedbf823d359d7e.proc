Solid Conference: Hardware and the Networked Home

   Written by
   Patrick Sisson
   February 24, 2014
   Networking technology and internet-powered apps mean interior design
   and architecture are about to become more personal. But with this
   technological shift, it’s the homes and devices that will be doing the
   personalization.
   Solid Con 2014 software technology conference
   Solid Con 2014—a conference promoting "software, hardware,
   everywhere"—arrives in San Francisco on May 21, 2014, and presents a
   range of speakers from Google, MIT, and more.

   Positioning itself at the nexus of hardware and software, the first
   Solid Conference (May 21-22 in San Francisco) will unite makers,
   thinkers, designers and developers from Google X, MIT and an array of
   tech firms to discuss developments such as smart sensors, networked
   homes and adaptive intelligence, all of which have the potential to
   disrupt and reshape the world of design. It’s “software and hardware
   uniting to bring intelligence into our lives,” according to O'Reilly's
   Jon Bruner, who chairs Solid with MIT Media Lab's Joi Ito.

   Multiple factors have brought us to this nexus of technology, according
   to Bruner: better supply chains, pervasive networking and cloud
   computing, a growth in wifi connectivity and the evolution of
   machine-learning algorithms. A wave of intelligent hardware and
   software technology and devices will bring about new concepts of
   connectivity and new ways to interact with previously passive objects.

   “The interesting thing is you’ll see intelligent products intended to
   interact with us less,” says Bruner. “Think about how the Nest
   thermostat learns from your behaviors. Interaction will become natural
   and pre-emptive. It’ll work beyond the screen. Lighting appliances and
   energy saving applications are a compelling place to start.”

   Guest speakers include Astro Teller (Head of Google X research
   division, i.e. “Chief of Moonshots"), Ivan Poupyrev (Google research
   scientist, interactive technology), Nadya Peek (MIT Center for Bits and
   Atoms), Tim O’Reilly (Founder of O'Reilly Media), Andra Keay (Founder,
   Silicon Valley Robotics), Joi Ito (Director of MIT Media Lab), Hiroshi
   Ishii (Computer scientist, Tangible Media Group at MIT), Neil
   Gershenfeld (Director, Center for Bits and Atoms at MIT), Renee DiResta
   (Associate at O'Reilly AlphaTech Ventures), Rodney Brooks (Founder,
   Chairman and CTO, ReThink Robotics), Ayah Bdeir (Interactive artist,
   engineer, and founder/CEO of LittleBits), and Carl Bass (President and
   CEO, Autodesk).
