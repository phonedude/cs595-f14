Amazon v. Hachette: Everyone Is Wrong But Me

   Submitted by Christopher Wright on Fri, 2014-08-01 13:46

   Update 5:12 PM (CST): Global edit, Hatchette->Hachette. Because
   apparently I thought the publisher was actually named after an axe.

   Updated 5:18 PM (CST), 11 August: Someone popular linked to this and
   site traffic is crazy. Load times are slow. Apologies. Also, see the
   addendum at the end.

   I hoped I’d be able to stay out of this whole Hachette/Amazon mess. It
   should be easy: I’m not a recognized authority on publishing, after
   all, and my soapbox isn’t really pointed in that direction. But as it
   happens, no one in this argument is saying what I want them to say, so
   I’m going to have to say it myself, and leaving comments on other
   people’s blogs just isn’t going to cut it for me.

The Short Version

   This is a horrible fight. No matter who wins we’re probably screwed.
   Hachette isn’t the hero, and Amazon isn’t the hero either.

The Long Version

   Looking at this fight all by itself, without any context at all, Amazon
   probably deserves to win--and honestly, I think it probably will win
   whether it deserves to or not. There’s no legitimate reason an ebook
   should cost the same as a paperback. “Well we really want to” is not a
   legitimate reason. “Because we can get away with it” is only legitimate
   from a business perspective if you can actually get away with it, and
   the current fight between Amazon and Hachette suggests that they can’t.

   As reader of books I want ebooks to be cheaper than paperbacks because
   a) they’re obviously cheaper to make and b) when I “buy” an ebook I
   have fewer rights to do what I want with it than I do when I buy a
   paperback, so please don’t try to pretend it’s the same thing. If the
   first sale doctrine doesn’t apply to an ebook purchase, or doesn’t
   apply as completely, then it better be cheaper. So strictly within the
   boundaries of the current argument between a publisher that wants to
   charge stupid prices for their product and a retailer that wants to
   sell a product at less-stupid prices, regardless of their actual
   motives, as someone who buys ebooks I gotta hand Amazon the win.

   That said: an Amazon win is probably not in anyone’s long-term
   interests.

   Here is the secret to understanding my take on Amazon: they’re not part
   of the publishing industry, although the things they do certainly
   affect it. They’re not a service and retail company, though that is the
   way they make all their money. At its core, Amazon is and always has
   been part of the computer industry, and if you view them from that
   perspective their business practices should scare the shit out of you.

Amazon: The Good

   I’m not going to describe my opinion of Amazon as “nuanced,” because it
   really isn’t. At the end of the day I’m a fan.

   I remember using them back when all they sold were books. I loved them,
   because I could find any book I wanted and I didn’t have to drive
   anywhere to get it. I guess that makes me a horrible person as far as
   local book stores go, and honestly I can see their point, but I could
   go to a book store and not find what I wanted, and wait for them to
   order it for me, which would take a few weeks, or I could go to Amazon
   and buy the book and even if they didn’t have it in their warehouse
   they’d get it to me in less time than the book store could.

   Then they started selling everything else under the sun, and that made
   it better. Honestly, the only thing I don’t buy from them is food,
   because buying food over the internet strikes me as a Really Bad Idea
   For Various Reasons Which Probably Belong In A Separate Post.

   As far as customer experience goes, Amazon has the complete package.
   Even their customer support is outstanding: I once accidentally shipped
   a gift to the wrong address and the Amazon representative was able to
   change the shipping address in mid-route to make sure it got to the
   right place. That’s incredible. Any time I’ve ever had a problem with
   Amazon, even as a self-published author (when CreateSpace kept
   insisting I wasn’t naming the titles of my books correctly) as soon as
   I was able to communicate with an actual human being the matter was
   resolved promptly and professionally. While I know that not everyone
   has had this experience (customer support outcomes depend as much on
   whether or not the CS Rep is good at their job, or is having a good day
   overall, as much as it does on the system put in place by the company)
   this experience has been consistent enough to convince me that Amazon
   puts a lot of effort into making sure Customer Support is actually
   focused on supporting the customer.

   This is fantastic, and this is one of the reasons so many people are so
   happy to use them. And this is in direct contrast to my experiences
   with customer support at Barnes and Noble, which once resulted in me
   shouting obscenities at the top of my lungs (much to the amusement of
   my co-workers) after being transferred to yet another subdivision of
   B&N customer support for the eighth time.

   So yeah, as a customer, Amazon is fantastic. And as a customer I’m
   pretty loyal to them, not because I think Jeff Bezos is my bestest
   personal friend forever but because I’ve yet to use another service
   that works as well as they do.

   But stepping away from being a customer... let’s talk about
   self-publishing. I started self-publishing in 2011 when I published Pay
   Me, Bug!, which may or may not continue to be published under that
   name, and I continued self-publishing when I started serializing
   Curveball. Of course, self-publishing existed before Amazon supported
   it, but I think it’s fair to say it wouldn’t be where it is now without
   Amazon jumping in the way it did. I tend to believe that
   self-publishing would still, over time, have become increasingly
   viable, but Amazon forced the issue, and I for one am grateful for
   that.

   Most of my sales are on Amazon. I sell on other stores, too, but Amazon
   is by far the most profitable: Amazon, distantly followed by Kobo (most
   months), followed by Google Play (which may wind up taking the #2 spot
   soon), followed by B&N, distantly followed by Smashwords, and finally
   the one guy in Norway who buys my books on iTunes (thanks dude). If you
   combined all the profits form all the other storefronts together,
   Amazon would still come out ahead most months.1

   Amazon makes it as easy as it can possibly be to get your book up
   there, and the level of support it provides, while it tends to be
   restricted to email, is still prompt, responsive, and professional.

   CreateSpace, which I also use, is also good. It’s improved dramatically
   since I first started using it. It’s not quite at the level of Ingram
   in terms of book quality (and it doesn’t do hardback) but it’s cheaper
   and easier to use, and the quality is high enough to make it come out
   ahead.2

   It is good enough and aggressive enough that there are self-published
   authors who have been able to quit their day jobs and self-publish full
   time, focusing only on the Amazon market. Think about that for a
   second. They don’t need to sell anywhere else, and they’re supporting
   themselves.

   That’s a success story, and Amazon deserves credit for it. What they
   did was pretty bold and it changed the market. Kudos.

Amazon: The Bad

   So after saying all those glowing things about Amazon I should be
   firmly in their camp, basking in the reflected glow of my adoration as
   it bounces off Jeff Bezos’ shining, chrome-silvered armor, right? Well,
   no. This is where my fellow self-publishers accuse me of having “Amazon
   Derangement Sydrome,” because despite my enthusiasm for their company,
   I’m pretty sure they’re going to turn on us all the minute they get
   their lock on the market.

   Which is what they’re trying to do: make no mistake: Amazon wants to be
   the next monopoly. They want it all. They’re convinced they can do it
   the best (and so far they can) and the prize of doing it the best is to
   Get All The Money. If you think monopolies are OK then this entire
   argument will mean nothing to you. My bias is that monopolies only work
   when they are heavily regulated, and even then it’s debatable.

   This is an argument that is frequently used by companies who are
   directly competing with Amazon, and many people who defend Amazon’s
   business practices like to point out that the motives of those
   companies are suspect. This is a fair observation. My
   counter-observation is that the argument is still true.

   This goes back to my declaration that Amazon is best observed within
   the context of the computer industry. I make this argument because
   because Amazon acts like a company in the computer industry. I will go
   so far as to say that Amazon acts a lot like a scrappy little company
   called Microsoft, back in its early days.

   I don’t make this comparison lightly. When Microsoft first really got
   momentum under its belt, when it started to become a power in its own
   right in the market place, what it was doing was, in some ways, heroic.
   The industry leader at the time was IBM, and it was a very bad IBM. It
   ruled the market with an iron and fairly uninspiring fist. It could
   wreck companies. It could destroy emerging ideas it didn’t like. It had
   so much control that the Department of Justice had to step in and
   severely restrict the way it did business.

   Microsoft represented a refreshing alternative. It recognized a new
   business line that allowed a lot more people to get involved, start
   businesses, make money. It decentralized computing to the point that
   people could start businesses and sell computers and software and
   services and things without having to play by IBM’s rules.

   They also—and I want to be absolutely clear that I am freely and
   cheerfully giving Microsoft credit for this—recognized that the way to
   make their business successful was to help make computers look more
   accessible. If you compared Apple to Microsoft back in the days of DOS,
   and even the days of Windows 3.0 and 3.1, Apple would win on
   reliability and usability. But Microsoft did a lot more work on selling
   the idea that computers were useful for everyone, and people responded
   to that. And in the very beginning, Microsoft’s technical and customer
   support was unparalleled. Not to mention they produced some of the
   finest technical documentation I’ve ever read.

   Of course, Microsoft was also ruthless when it came to business, and
   that ruthlessness was adopted by the computer industry at large as
   Standard Operating Procedure. I won’t get into that side of it—those of
   you who read Help Desk already know my opinions on those tactics. Those
   of you who aren’t familiar with my comic, well, the archives are over
   there.

   For those of you unwilling to go through 18 years of comic archives,3
   here’s the short version: every company in the computer industry
   behaves like a sociopath. They will do good things for you for as long
   as there’s profit in it, but as soon as it reaches the point where they
   don’t have to, they immediately flip to abusing you, relentlessly, all
   the while telling you there’s nothing they can do about it, and it’s
   probably all your fault.4

   Keep in mind that this description applies to every for-profit company
   in the computer industry. This includes companies I like, like Google.
   There’s a reason I changed their company motto.

   That’s where Amazon comes from. It has adopted all the nasty little
   tricks every computer company uses to try to lock in its customer base
   to its chosen platform. Let’s look at those tricks below:

EULAs

   An End User License Agreement is that thing that pops up any time you
   try to install a piece of software or activate a proprietary piece of
   hardware. It’s something you probably don’t read, because they put a
   lot of words in it and use lawyer-speak to describe what you’re
   agreeing to... so even if you did read it you probably didn’t
   understand what you’re reading. It is, essentially, a contract without
   a signature. Clicking “Accept” takes the place of your signature. It is
   a lot more legally binding than it probably should be.

   Amazon is full of EULAs. They don’t call them that specifically, but
   you “sign” one when you create an account as a customer, and you “sign”
   another when you create a KDP account as a self-publisher, and you
   “sign” a third when you create a CreateSpace account, and a fourth when
   you decide to try to sell things on Audible, and now that they own
   ComiXology there’s a fifth for using that, and that’s just off the top
   of my head. And in every single one of these agreements, you will find
   at least two things that potentially spell trouble:
     * Arbitration Clauses. If you ever decide that Amazon is playing
       dirty pool and you want to pursue legal action against them, well,
       you probably can’t, because you’ve agreed that any dissatisfaction
       will be resolved not through the legal system, but through
       arbitration. Amazon has already chosen who the arbitrator will be.
       The deck is stacked against you, and even if you win, that doesn’t
       mean Amazon has to change their practices: arbitration doesn’t set
       legal precedent.
     * Terms are not set in stone. Every EULA contains language that says
       something to the effect of “company reserves the right to update
       these terms at any time, for any reason, without consulting you
       first, and it’s up to you to keep up with these changes.” Many
       (though not all) EULAs also contain language that says “we will
       assume you agree to these changes unless you uninstall the
       program/cancel your account/do something drastic to remove yourself
       from the market and/or community.” In other words, even if you read
       the entire EULA and decide you’re willing to live with it, there’s
       nothing, absolutely nothing, that prevents Amazon (or any other
       company that uses this) from changing it later, and keeping up with
       those changes is entirely your responsibility. I’d like to note
       that in this respect, Hachette actually has a much better
       bargaining position than self-publishers do. They can actually
       negotiate agreements. And Amazon is trying to weaken that position
       and put them in a position where Hachette has to play like everyone
       else.

   So there’s that.

Use of patents against competition

   This one is a little murky, and lawyers versed in intellectual property
   and patent law will be able to argue more convincingly in either
   direction than I will. Amazon gets sued a lot by other companies over
   patent issues, and Bezos has spoken out over the need for patent
   reform, but they aren’t innocent of using patents to stop competition.
   In 2009 (correction: 1999) Amazon sued Barnes and Noble because B&N had
   set up a feature they called the “Express Lane.” If you were on their
   website and you only wanted to buy one thing, you clicked on the
   Express Lane button and you bought it automatically (assuming your
   purchasing information was already entered into your account.) Amazon
   claimed this violated their “One-click” patent, and they fought like
   hell to keep B&N from using a similar technology to provide an
   equivalent user experience.

   In other words: B&N studied something Amazon did that its customers
   liked, it tried to compete, and Amazon sued them for doing it.

Pursuit of lock-in on all levels

   “Lock-in” is where a company introduces proprietary and
   strictly-controlled tools and environments that give them absolute
   control over their market. Anything Amazon does in the digital market
   is done with lock-in in mind. Let’s look at some examples:
     * Use of proprietary file formats—the file formats that Amazon uses
       to sell ebooks are proprietary. Only Amazon controls them. If you
       buy an ebook on Amazon.com you are locked into that ecosystem. If
       you want to build a reader or file converter that can use those
       file formats independently of Amazon products, the only legal way
       to do so is recreate it from scratch without actually looking at
       any of the original code or libraries. This is a slow, agonizing
       process and can be immediately negated... all Amazon has to do is
       change the file format, and all your previous work is broken.
     * Use of proprietary hardware—their Kindle e-ink reader is great as
       long as you only buy Amazon. Their Kindle tablet would be a great
       general-use tablet, except that it’s not possible to install any
       other e-readers from any other company (B&N, Kobo, etc.) on it,
       unless you figure out how to jailbreak it and even then results are
       mixed. If you buy an Amazon device, you are committing to the
       Amazon environment, and that environment only.
     * Encouraging exclusivity—Amazon wants to be the only company that
       sells your ebook. The only one. It doesn’t force you to do it, but
       if you decide to use KDP Select you get more powerful promotional
       tools at your disposal, you get a higher percentage of the sales in
       more Amazon markets, and you get access to some genuinely
       interesting new tools like Kindle Serials or Kindle Unlimited (“The
       Netflix for Books.”) The trade off is you can’t make it available
       anywhere else, even on your own website. In other words, if I were
       to publish Pay Me, Bug! or Curveball on KDP Select, I would have to
       remove them from Eviscerati.Org. I would also have to stop
       distributing them with a Creative Commons License, since the CC
       license grants you, the reader, distribution rights that KDP Select
       doesn’t even grant me, the author and publisher.

   File format, hardware, and content providers—all three areas that
   Amazon tries to make exclusive, so that they and only they control it.
   They aren’t the only company that has ever tried to do this. Apple
   works this way, in almost exactly the same way, though they aren’t as
   aggressive about pushing into other markets. Microsoft invented this
   approach, and they had the same aggressive marketing strategies. The
   proprietary .doc format is one of the reasons it has been almost
   impossible for me to use anything other than Microsoft Word for most of
   my professional career... for the longest time it just wasn’t practical
   for other companies to try to figure out a way to correctly import and
   export .doc files—whenever they got something right, Microsoft was
   tweak the file a little to break whatever they’d figured out. That’s
   what lock-in allows you to do. If you signed on to be a “Microsoft
   Preferred Partner” you got access to all kinds of goodies and perks
   that made it easier for you to create software that ran in the
   Microsoft environment.

   … and then, when they decided they could make more money doing it
   themselves, they’d create a competing version of your product, change a
   few APIs, stop talking to you, and within a year you were out of
   business.

   “Lock-in” only benefits monopolists, and companies that want to be
   monopolists. The only reason you pursue it is to make it harder to lose
   customers. If you have 500 Amazon ebooks and you stumble across an
   ereader or tablet that is functionally superior your current one in
   every way, with the sole exception of not having a Kindle Reader
   app—you’re probably not going to buy it, because doing so would throw
   away your current investment of ebooks.

   “Lock-in” ultimately screws other people trying to do business because
   once it’s achieved, there is no way to negotiate terms. Once it hits
   that point, you need to invent a new market first. All the other
   markets are gone.

Hachette: The Ugly

   OK, so now that I’ve exposed my wild-eyed crazy to the world and
   accused Amazon of trying to enslave all of humanity with its dastardly,
   monopolistic schemes, it’s reasonable to assume that ultimately I’ll
   take Hachette’s side because Monopolies Are Bad. It’s reasonable, but
   it’s wrong. I do not take Hachette’s side in this. My official position
   is that neither of these companies deserve to win this fight. But one
   of them will, because I can’t think of a way to resolve this as a draw,
   and since one of them will it’s probably going to be Amazon, and as I
   said above, taking only this fight in context, Amazon probably has the
   stronger claim.

   Here’s why:

   Amazon can articulate a solution to a problem, and Hachette can’t
   articulate anything other than “Amazon is bad.”

   Amazon has pointed out that charging huge prices for ebooks—prices
   that, cost-wise, make them indistinguishable from paperbacks—is stupid.
   My apologies to all the publishers and writers who will be offended by
   this, but Amazon is right. They are absolutely making self-serving
   statements, but those self-serving statements are, from the perspective
   of a reader who likes buying books, and prefers buying more books with
   the same amount of money, 100% indisputably true. Their vision advances
   the market in a way that is better for customers. They have a position
   that has a solution.

   Hachette’s position is “Amazon is trying to control the market.” Well,
   I actually agree with that position. But they haven’t offered a
   solution to that argument. They have no vision on how to create a
   market that effectively competes with Amazon that answers any of the
   claims Amazon has made about how their vision is better for consumers,
   or about how their vision is better for other publishers, like me.
   Sure, Amazon is opening the market wide only until they can sew it back
   up again, putting a nice little monogramed “Amazon” on the side of the
   duffel bag that will store the severed heads of all the publishers who
   dare cross them in the future, but their vision includes a description
   of how this change will make everything better while Hachette’s vision
   includes a description of how everything will remain exactly the same.

   Siding with Hachette, in other words, doesn’t stop Amazon from being a
   monopoly. It does exactly nothing to stop Amazon’s growth or its power
   because Amazon is still the place everyone goes to buy everything
   because they still have the best game in town. Hachette’s argument in
   this fight is “we shouldn’t have to have a game, come on guys, I mean
   what do you expect us to do, things?” They want status quo, and they’re
   using “ARGH AMAZON IS MONOPOLY COME DEFEND US FROM THEIR EVIL WAYS” in
   order to justify continuing to use Amazon’s evil ways in exactly the
   same way they did last year.

   In other words, Hachette views Amazon’s power as bad only when it gets
   in their way.

In Conclusion

   I will not sign a letter in support of Hachette. I feel bad for the
   authors who are suffering financially and I hope they get paid soon,
   but Hachette’s accusations are manipulative plays to our paranoia, no
   matter how justified that paranoia might be, because they have exactly
   zero plans on how to correct all the things they currently think are
   wrong with the market.

   I will not sign a letter in support of Amazon. While as a customer I
   think they are fabulous and while they have the best deal in town for
   most self-publishers out there today, that environment is becoming
   increasingly more dependent on using Amazon and only using Amazon. I’ve
   seen that market before, and my historical perspective makes me more
   than suspicious, it makes me alarmed. Too many arguments in support of
   Amazon run along the basic theme of “Yeah I know they’re not my best
   friend, but basically they’re my best friend.” Too many other arguments
   run along the lines of “they would never do that!” which in my
   experience generally leads to “they,” whoever they are, doing exactly
   that. The fact that there is a really good thing happening right now
   doesn’t mean it will remain a good thing, that they intend it to remain
   a good thing, or that there aren’t better things out there somewhere,
   but if Amazon continues to succeed at its lock-in strategies then we’ll
   never get a chance to figure out what those better things might be.
   Market forces are great for surfing, but man, that undertow is a bitch.

   Everyone taking sides in this argument is wrong. Every single one of
   you. You are taking sides for the wrong reasons, supporting the wrong
   people, endorsing the wrong philosophies, and choosing either path is
   ultimately bad for everyone. You are wrong, I am right, and this is
   why.

   ...either that, or I’m a paranoid crank. This is also possible.

   Addendum, 8/11/14: I wanted to take the opportunity to link to a piece
   by Dave Bryant who points out that there are other factors beyond the
   cost of printing a book that affect bottom line costs. It's a fair
   point -- I don't think that the labor costs in book production would
   necessitate ebooks being $14 a pop, but it's worth keeping in mind
   there is a minimum threshold you need to clear in order for a book to
   be profitable.

       virtue.

Question: is it legal to

   Submitted by Mike (not verified) on Fri, 2014-08-01 19:15

   Question: is it legal to reverse engineer the kindle format? I thought
   it included DRM, and reverse engineering that was made illegal by the
   DMCA. Hachette can't even provide a tool to unlock it on the books they
   sold through Amazon.

   Comment: How can you possibly think a regulated monopoly works? Think
   of the large monopolies you absolutely hate to deal with, that
   consistently screw their customers: the cable companies, the phone
   company, most of your utilities, the post office. Those are monopolies
   that are so heavily regulated that it's illegal to compete with them!

   Final note: I don't care. I'm a huge fan of Amazon, been a prime member
   pretty much since day one, but I won't buy electronic media from them.
   I won't buy media that I can't play on the player of my choice, and I
   won't buy media that has DRM.

     is it legal to reverse engineer the kindle format?

   It is if you black box it, which I think is what Calibre did.

     Comment: How can you possibly think a regulated monopoly works?

   What I specifically said was "My bias is that monopolies only work when
   they are heavily regulated, and even then it’s debatable." I don't
   think that's a very strong endorsement. I think you can make an
   argument that monopolies are a necessity in some situations, but in
   those situations the only chance you have is to regulate it up and
   down.

   Cable companies are not regulated, not to the degree utility companies
   are, and utility companies are a lot easier to deal with. The post
   office actually works pretty well. Phone companies are on the same
   level as cable companies--not heavily regulated.

   The solution is to keep your powder dry. Monopolies can only extract
   monopoly profit to the extent they do not exceed the difference between
   their prices and practices and the next most efficient possible
   producer. That difference is both in operating the competing business
   and setting it up in the first place. Keeping that space small will
   keep Amazon's future monopoly depredations small. It won't stop them.
   Nothing will stop them from happening. But they're the least cost route
   to reducing them to a minimum.

   Finally on a machine I can comment from :)
   I find myself in agreement with you on a lot of this. I'm from rural
   Alaska, so getting any sort of new books at all was generally a pain.
   When Amazon came along, it was amazing for me -- not only because of
   the vast selection, but, as things grew, we could still get it shipped
   to us, and for free at that. If I wanted to buy a twenty-five dollar
   stick of memory, I could go to website A, and pay $32 for it, and get
   charged $75 shipping, or I could buy it from Amazon for $28 and get it
   shipped for free. They've recently raised the threshold to $35 I think,
   but it's still the most consistent place to be able to order goods from
   without a massive surcharge.
   That all said, I realize that at some point they may well reach
   critical weight and not be so friendly. I buy physical things from
   Amazon, and I buy music. I like being able to download my music
   DRM-free, and they have some things I listen to. I have a tablet -- on
   which I utilize Aildiko for my e-books, the large majority of which are
   from Project Gutenberg. My copies of your books, Chris, I picked up
   from Smashwords partly because how multiple format friendly they
   appeared. I have no desire to buy into the Kindle eco-system. I bought
   my tablet precisely because of how free it was of from bloatware or
   anything except Android basic OS and apps. And while I don't think I've
   ever read any books by this particular publisher and wouldn't miss not
   seeing their books on Amazon, I'm also cautious that maybe the next
   house that Amazon leans on is mine.
   My rambling aside, is there a takeaway from all this? The case will
   likely be decided in court, but are there things that we, as consumers
   can do to try to keep Amazon on a favorable path? Supporting
   alternatives? Strongly worded letters sent to Bezos's house? :P

   I believe it is. I remember reading a piece of legislation on the books
   that said that any file format that was not openly published could be
   reverse engineered in any manner that anyone wanted and that the
   provision superseded any contracts, agreements, or anything else to the
   contrary. Of course, most companies just publish their formats on their
   web page and have done. Now, of course, if they have published their
   format (making it non-proprietary) you can't reverse engineer the

For what it's worth, I once

   Submitted by stjen on Mon, 2014-08-04 21:08

   For what it's worth, I once read/heard about the "safe" way to reverse
   engineer anything. You need two teams of people. The first team gets
   down and dirty, studies the original code from the provider, reads the
   assembler, runs disassemblers, runs test cases thru the code, discovers
   exactly how the code behaves in each and every possible case -- and
   then they document it completely, to the last detail, how it behaves,
   Without saying a word as to how the original code does it.

   The second team is strongly skilled, but has absolutely No Connection
   or Knowledge of anything from the original publisher (they are
   "Virgins"), never worked for them, or with them, or with the original
   development platform, or anything at all that could tie any of them to
   any knowledge of the original provider and their code. They take that
   detailed specification, and write code that behaves exactly as
   specified in the design docs. (Perhaps their results run thru the same
   test cases developed for the original deconstruction, to prove that
   they behave exactly the same.)

   If you do that, and can prove that, then there is no way the original
   provider can sue you for doing reverse engineering on a basis of theft
   of proprietary information.

   On the other hand, doing it this way takes forever, and again, as you
   mentioned, if they change the underlying formats and such, you may have
   to start from scratch. You'll usually be a whole version behind in your
   efforts. But you can't be sued, although they may try, or try to get
   you on patent infringement, or some such.

The black box method (more

   Submitted by bugstomper on Sun, 2014-08-10 02:50

   The black box method (more commonly called "clean room" development)
   only works for certain things that are protected by copyright. If
   Amazon has some software that reads a proprietary file format and you
   have a team that looks at it to figure out how it works, write up
   functional specs, and have a separate team that never looked at
   Amazon's software write their own implementation from the specs, then
   the new software is an independent production and does not violate
   Amazon's copyright in the software. However, patents do not have the
   loophole that copyright does for independent invention. If Amazon has a
   patent on something that is necessary for reading their file format,
   even if you come up with the idea all by yourself they still have the
   right to stop you from using it. The DMCA is another block to that
   loophole - If Amazon has something in their software that can be
   considered to be a protection against people copying the content of the
   books in violation of copyright, then even a clean room implementation
   that manages to work around the DRM is a violation of the DMCA. If the
   only way to read the book is to unlock the DRM then clean room
   practices may still not allow you to write your own reader software.

   This is a letter I would write to Amazon, since they're asking:

   Gentlemen,

   While Amazon is to be commended for variety of products, price and
   customer service, the present spat with Hachette is a tad surreal.

   Hachette has little to stand on, while Amazon purports to lower prices
   to consumers, increase sales figures... on the basis of lower
   production/distribution costs. Amazon has even proposed to funnel funds
   to the creators directly, up to 100%.

   But the picture is not complete. On one hand, Amazon pushes services to
   have writers be able to distribute ONLY through Amazon. The Kindle
   platform is a closed silo. Terms and conditions of most services are so
   slanted towards Amazon. Put all items together. There is only one
   conclusion: the strategy is to replace the oligopoly of printing majors
   to become a monopoly of e-distribution.

   This is confirmed by Amazon's admitted practices of 'bumping down'
   Hachette products unless they meet your demands. Amazon enticed them
   into your service, now Amazon wants to modify terms. Way to go!
   Market forces state that if publishers maintain high prices, then they
   will wither away if competition beats them on price. Whatever, if it's
   too expensive, their sales will drop; it's their management
   consequences.

   I cannot encourage Amazon to pursue such a strategy/tactic. Guess why I
   don't own a Kindle?

   As usual, reality stands somewhere in the middle. If Amazon were truly
   interested in its clients and its producers it would:
   • allow publishers to set their prices
   • could refuse access to some publishers (it's fine, you don't have to
   do business with everyone)
   • publish the amount of the price that goes to the author. If it is
   unknown, state so.
   • release Kindle from its silo.
   • publish the number of items sold (the author can thus track earnings)

   Consumers can make their decisions accordingly. Amazon would,
   incidentally be much appreciated by the entire marketplace (rather than
   risk the boomerang it may have launched).

   than the marginal cost of creating an e-book (the latter being,
   essentially zero), but manufacturing is really the least of the costs
   of producing most books (putting aside lavish print editions with
   six-color plates throughout and the like). The cost of that e-book also
   includes editorial costs, promotional costs, and a whole host of other
   non-obvious requirements beyond mere manufacturing. It also, for better
   or for worse, includes the cost of producing books which might not earn
   back their own costs. If we lose publishers, then books will end up
   falling into the awful morass of click-bait level production that we
   see now with apps and websites. I for one would not like to lose Karen
   Russel or Adam Levin to a flood of buzzfeed-style dinosaur erotica.

   the market will bear, and there's nothing wrong with that unless you
   think capitalism is a fundamentally flawed system. As a writer, I'm
   surprised you think that the marginal cost of producing e-books should
   dictate the retail price, as there is so much more to publishing than
   just moving bits.

   I'm concerned that you, like nearly everyone else, are approaching this
   situation only from the perspective of "who is right about the cost of
   e-books?" For me, that's a complete non-issue. First, because I don't
   own a Kindle or care to--I still buy paper books. But second and more
   imporantly, because I have been an avid Amazon consumer, like you,
   buying nearly everything but food from them--drugstore-type items,
   clothes, electronics, household goods, books, DVDs and Blu-Rays, etc.

   I don't view this as an argument about e-books. To me, this is a
   monopolist HURTING ITS CUSTOMERS by punishing its partners during a
   disagreement about pricing. They're now doing it with Disney DVDs, and
   they did it with Warner DVDs a few months ago. What makes Amazon WORK
   for me is the one-stop shopping--that I can find anything there,
   reliably. This arrogant policy of "punishing" suppliers that they're
   negotiating with, by making that supplier's items unavailable for
   pre-order, or backlogged for weeks, or dropping off recommendation
   lists, is the bigger problem. That HURTS CUSTOMERS. It's a crappy way
   to do business, too.

   I went from making about 25 purchases a year from Amazon to ZERO since
   May. I have an Amazon credit card accumulating bonus points that I
   won't spend. I'm gradually shifting my purchases to another card. I've
   sought out alternate websites to buy my office supplies, household
   goods, clothes, books and media, etc. I've gone from assuming I'll
   return to Amazon when this incident is over, to realizing that Amazon
   will continue to behave this way, and I may have to give it up
   permanently.

   Nothing I've tried to buy has been affected by their throttling their
   partners' inventories like Hachette and Disney--but I'm vehemently
   against this as a principle. If your company seems to be headed toward
   being a monopoly, Microsoft is NOT the company you should use as a
   model.

   I'm assuming those editorial costs will be the same as the editorial
   costs, promotional costs, and the "whole host of other non-obvious
   requirements beyond mere manufacturing" that a book would get as a
   paperback, trade paperback, hardback.

   And I'd still expect the editorial process of the physical books to be
   higher because you'd have to print out galleys in order to do it
   properly.

     If we lose publishers, then books will end up falling into the awful
     morass of click-bait level production that we see now with apps and
     websites. I for one would not like to lose Karen Russel or Adam

   Aside from that, I'm not sure how you're interpreting my argument. My

   argument is that Hatchette is making a poor case on its side of this

"Hachette can’t articulate

   Submitted by Glenn Fleishman (not verified) on Mon, 2014-08-11 16:32

   "Hachette can’t articulate anything other than “Amazon is bad.”"

   Not quite. What they've said (including in a letter from the CEO a few
   days ago released in response to Amazon encouraging people to write
   him) is that they want the flexibility to charge what they think makes
   market sense instead of agreeing to Amazon's $10-or-bust strategy.
   Amazon's presentation of the numbers about what ebooks cost, etc.,
   ignores the reality that ebooks decline in price over time. Publishers
   who produce books across multiple media rely on early hardcover sales
   as part of the way a given book produces a positive return above
   production cost, general overhead, and author's advances and royalties.

   Most ebooks don't cost $15 to $20. They're mostly $10 plus or minus a
   couple books. If you see a $12 to $15 ebook, wait a few months or a
   year, and it's $10 or less most of the time.

   What Amazon is fighting for in its negotiations is the right to
   eviscerate the business model of publishers that still leans on
   hardcovers. By doing so, this makes it less likely publishers can
   produce as many books. Most books make little or no money. Most books
   are a risk. Only the blockbusters and some evergreens produce the bulk
   of the profit that keeps them moving forward.

   Most of the books being sold have zero utility. People purchase them
   for entertainment. If the pricing were incorrect, people would stop
   buying them in the same quantities. Amazon's argument is that making
   all books no more than $10 (apparently in the adult trade
   fiction/nonfiction category, about $15 billion a year of sales in the
   US, of which about 27% is currently ebooks by revenue), sales will
   increase. That is a fiction: even if their analysis is correct, the
   last several years of book sales, including ebooks, show that there's a
   fairly close to zero-sum game.

   Amazon's $10 ebook pricing shifts sales from bricks and mortar stores
   of hardcovers, along with shifting them from their heavily discounted,
   less profitable own sales of hardcovers, to cheaper-to-fulfill,
   higher-margin ebooks.
