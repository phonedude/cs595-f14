“Lean” Urbanism Aims to Slim Down Regulation for Small-Time Builders and
Business Owners

   Last month, I reported on a proposed pedestrian plaza in South
   Philadelphia that, despite community support and a secured city grant,
   isn’t going to happen. The plaza would have taken away parking spaces,
   and city law requires 100 percent support from nearby property owners
   to change street uses or remove parking. One neighbor objected, and the
   project was iced.

   Puzzling through regulations and legalese, not to mention seeking
   permissions from multiple overlapping authorities, can be a
   discouraging and expensive slog. Yet it’s a necessary step in bringing
   even the smallest projects to life. The upshot? Local regulations are
   losing a race with the zeitgeist.

   “The biggest problem, and the one that makes cities feel the most
   vulnerable, is the liability culture,” said Andrés Duany, founder of
   the Congress for the New Urbanism, the premier organization promoting
   mixed-use, walkable communities. “They think ‘if we take any risk
   whatsoever — if there’s any slack in the interpretation of this code —
   we’ll get sued.’”

   Duany is a real estate developer, which means he knows what it’s like
   to get caught in red tape. Navigating out of it is impossible without a
   small army of lawyers and expeditors. “You can’t do anything without
   hiring a professional or a specialist in the regulations and the laws,”
   he said.

   Enter the new Project for Lean Urbanism. Administered by the Center for
   Applied Transect Studies and funded by a three-year, $600,000-plus
   grant from the Knight Foundation, PLU will devise tools and strategies
   designed to help small-time business and development types work
   through, and around, city regulations to achieve their visions more
   cheaply, quickly and easily.

   “Over time we’ve let regulation get too bloated, and it then becomes
   too expensive for young adults, young architects, young business people
   and immigrants to participate in the economy,” said Carol Coletta, vice
   president of community and national initiatives at the Knight
   Foundation. “The idea is to preserve what’s good about regulation —
   health, safety and respect for neighbors — but balance that with a
   reduction in unnecessary bloat that adds costs to all of our projects.”

   “Lean urbanism” represents a departure from prior strategies. In the
   past, CNU has worked to win policy changes from federal, state and
   local governments. Other urbanists have employed the “tactical”
   approach, or forcing changes through unsanctioned interventions from
   the ground up. This new method, however, aims to help small developers,
   entrepreneurs and neighborhood activists achieve what is possible
   without breaking the law or getting the city sued. The operating idea
   is that the city’s goal — avoiding liability — can be satisfied through
   a workaround, rather than outright bans that crowd out small-scale
   enterprise.

   “There’s nothing clean about this initiative,” Duany said. “Wherever we
   find an impediment, we’ll try to secure a patch or a workaround.”

   For an example of how lean urbanism will help cut through red tape, I
   ask Duany how it would benefit someone like my wife.

   My wife is a baker. She makes a mean chocolate pecan pie and has
   thought about launching an online store. She’d use Etsy to open a hand
   pie shop, but prefers to use our home kitchen so as not to lose money
   on rent payments to a commissary kitchen. But in Philadelphia, it’s
   illegal for her to sell food cooked in our house — even though she’s
   passed a food safety course for work.

   “You could get a half-page contract that the lean urbanism group would
   provide in a standard format,” Duany explained, “and that goes to the
   city and says, ‘I will take responsibility for any illness that this
   causes, and I will carry insurance. This is my responsibility.’ And you
   take the liability clearly so the city has none.”

   “You don’t have the money to hire a good lawyer to write a little
   contract,” he added, “but we can write that contract and make that
   freely available.”

   The concept is nothing if not timely. On New Years Eve, an Uber driver
   fatally struck a 6-year-old girl in San Francisco, raising questions of
   accountability for deregulated hired cars. A 2011 plane crash in
   Ireland raised similar questions when it turned out the company that
   sold the tickets was an Internet-based sales outfit that didn’t want
   the regulatory complexity of a standard airline. Instead, it aimed to
   serve as a matchmaker bringing customers to plane operators. The
   arrangement worked fine until the crash, which killed six.

   Who was responsible? At a moment when cities, individuals and companies
   must confront all sorts of new questions about accountability and
   public safety, the Project for Lean Urbanism could reorient the
   conversation.

   To Duany, the key is establishing safety standards that protect the
   public while also allowing smaller enterprises to compete. He offered
   the example of the Light Sport Aircraft regulations passed in the early
   1980s, which set up a flourishing market for small planes that didn’t
   have to meet the same standards as big commercial airlines.

   He also envisions designating “pink code” areas within cities. Similar
   to business improvement districts, these are areas where cities could
   try out leaner regulations and where business owners and planners could
   pursue opportunities more freely.

   “Anyone who has the success of their city foremost in their mind can
   understand why clearing out unnecessary bloat and regulation could only
   be a good thing,” Coletta said. “When you have a district that is
   thriving and there are more jobs available and the tax revenue is
   growing, I think most elected officials would celebrate that.”

   In its first year, PLU will begin compiling a body of research and
   reports on opportunities for workarounds in real estate development,
   business, liability and risk management, infrastructure, and education.
   The following two years will involve creating tools and strategies
   based on the findings, as well as field testing them via pilot
   initiatives and demonstration projects in select cities.
