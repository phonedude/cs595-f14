Apple Hires Chief Medical Officer From Pulse Oximetry Company Masimo,
Possibly for iWatch Team

   Thursday January 30, 2014 2:10 pm PST by Juli Clover
   Over the course of the last year, Apple has made several hires from the
   medical and sensor field, presumably to bolster the team of experts
   working on its much-rumored smart watch project, and MacRumors today
   learned of another high-profile sensor expert that has joined the
   company.
   Michael O'Reilly, M.D., formerly the Chief Medical Officer and EVP of
   Medical Affairs at Masimo Corporation, left his position in July of
   2013 to take on a role at Apple, possibly on the iWatch team. News of
   O'Reilly's employment at Apple was first leaked to MobiHealthNews last
   week and when contacted for comment earlier today, Masimo told
   MacRumors it "could not dispute" what had been reported.
   While O'Reilly was at Masimo, the company developed several cutting
   edge pulse oximetry devices, including the iSpO2 Pulse Oximeter that
   connects to the iPhone and gives readings via an accompanying app. The
   iSpO2, which takes its readings from a finger, is designed to measure
   both oxygen saturation in the blood and pulse rate, with technology
   that allows it to take readings during movement and with low blood
   flow.

   While it is not clear what position O'Reilly holds with Apple or how
   his pulse oximetry expertise will be used by the company, he does join
   a number of other hires in the medical field that have reportedly been
   recruited for the iWatch team. In 2013, Apple hired several scientists
   and executives from notable sensor companies like AccuVein, C8
   MediSensors, and Senseonics, and two weeks ago, another report pointed
   to two additional hires in the sensor field.
   Reports have suggested that Apple's smart watch project, the iWatch,
   could focus heavily on health sensors and biometrics, possibly
   including features like a pedometer and a heart rate monitor. Apple's
   multitude of hires in the health field does suggest, however, that the
   company could include even more advanced sensor technology in the
   iWatch or in a future product.
   With the addition of O'Reilly, Apple has now hired employees with
   expertise in pulse oximetry, vasculature visualization (vein finding),
   non-invasive glucose monitoring, blood chemistry monitoring via
   microneedle, heart/breath rate monitoring, and fitness. Notably,
   several hires have also had experience with low-profile, non-invasive
   biosensor devices.
   On his LinkedIn page, O'Reilly is also listed as both an Adjunct
   Associate Professor of Anesthesiology at the University of Michigan and
   a Professor of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Care at the University
   of California, Irvine.

   The only thing I don't understand is whether or not this will be
   stand-alone device or not.
   The only thing? Nobody knows any thing.

   I hope people can understand the potential of this product by now.
   Yeah, the sad part is that people still don't. 'Watches are useless'.
   Good thing Apple actually has intelligent, imaginative people working
   for them, as opposed to the people who can't even think past 'It tells
   time'.

   it seems that the watch is not nearly as close to being finished as i
   would have hoped. if they are still hiring people for sensors they
   can't possibly be finished with the design or testing of the watch.
   hopefully they speed things up! :apple:
   Note though that the hire was supposedly made last Julyâ€¦.

   At last, the penny has dropped for the watchers.
   The iWatch may well have some form of simple monitoring, but I reckon
   Apple is going much further into the medical field.
   Already iPads are used extensively in hospitals for displaying scan and
   x-ray results. Integrated medical systems could be the next big field
   for Apple, just as instrumentation was for Hewlett-Packard in the
   1960s. Could stray into Agilent
   (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agilent_Technologies)'s backyard.

   I suspect you are onto something This is why I thought Apple might make
   a play for the remnants of Kodak, with their medical imaging products
   and patents.

   I'm still totally unsold on the idea of carrying around a mobile
   medical station. I'm not a professional athlete; I don't need real-time
   statistics on what every organ in my body is doing, how much energy I'm
   using, etc.
   The Tarahumara people (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarahumara_people)
   can run 200 mile-stretches over a couple of days, and AFAIK they don't
   use fitbits, Nike smart watches, iWatches or anything else. They drink
   beer and eat beans and squirrels.
   Not just their young people, either - even the middle-aged and elderly
   can run enormous distances.
   Point is: teching yourself up doesn't make you healthier or fitter.
   Some of the most primitive people on the planet could put our best
   olympic athletes to shame.
   That said, of course, I said I'm not sold on the idea. Maybe Apple will
   convince me, but if this really is a "health" statistics device, then
   no thanks.
