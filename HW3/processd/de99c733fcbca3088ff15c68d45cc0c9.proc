   Watch why we CodeAcross (and why you should too).
   Join us, and hundreds of people, this weekend to help make our
   communities better.
   CodeAcross 2014 is a weekend of events taking place in cities around
   the world. There will be events hosted simultaneously in 47 communities
   this weekend, February 21-23.
   Coinciding with International Open Data Day, the goal of CodeAcross is
   to inspire residents everywhere to get actively involved in their
   community — and to put the massive amounts of public data to good use.
   Find one near you, and join the
   fun: http://codeforamerica.org/codeacross
   Everyone is invited! Bring family and friends.
   This year's CodeAcross is co-hosted with the Sunlight Foundation and
   the Open Knowledge Foundation and is sponsored by Esri and Microsoft.
