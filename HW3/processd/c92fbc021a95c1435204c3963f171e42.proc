Apple Is Taking Action Against Fake Ratings On The App Store

   MakeSpace, the NY-based startup that thinks of itself as a Dropbox for
   physical objects, has recently announced that it secured Fab.com CFO
   David Lapter as new Chief Financial Officer, and SVP of Business
   Operations.

   Lapter is a serial startup CFO, and most recently comes from Fab.com
   where he joined in 2011. At the time, the ecommerce platform was but a
   few months old. Fab.com now brings in revenues of over $100 million
   globally.

   Before Fab.com, Lapter was CFO and EVP of business operations at
   KickApps, as well as CFO at CTSpace. Both companies were acquired
   during his tenure at them.

   Here’s what MakeSpace CEO and founder Sam Rosen had to say in a
   prepared statement:

     Bringing David on board to help guide our growth is a huge win as we
     scale locally in New York and accelerate our expansion to new
     markets. I’m ecstatic to welcome David as an integral part of our
     management team and I look forward to working alongside him to
     implement our long term strategic vision for the company.

   MakeSpace is a service that lets you tag and store items that you own
   with the help of an app and MakeSpace’s on-demand pickup and drop-off
   service. Not only does it save the user time commuting to and from
   storage spaces, but actually saves time based on sheer organization, as
   the folks at MakeSpace know exactly where each item is at any given
   time. When you request your old soccer ball, they just grab it and
   bring it over to you.

   In the past year, MakeSpace has picked up a $1.3 million seed round
   from Upfront Ventures, Lowercase Capital, High Peaks Venture Partners,
   and Collaborative Fund. And in May, the company picked up $8 million in
   Series A.
