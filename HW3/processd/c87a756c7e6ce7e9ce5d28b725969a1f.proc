   Edward Snowden
   By Noa Yachot, Communications Strategist, ACLU at 9:49am

   In his first conversation in front of an audience since his disclosures
   began making global headlines last year, Edward Snowden will appear via
   live video next Monday at SXSW Interactive, the festival that brings
   together tens of thousands of technology professionals and enthusiasts
   every year in Austin. He'll be talking to the ACLU's Ben Wizner and
   Christopher Soghoian.

   The panel will take place on March 10 at 11 a.m. Central Time. A live
   stream will be available on The Texas Tribune's website, and the video
   will be available here afterwards. Here's the full description from
   SXSW:

     Our communications are not secure. Our telephone calls, emails,
     texts, and web browsing activity are largely transmitted without any
     encryption, making it easy for governments to intercept them, in
     bulk. Likewise, the mobile devices, apps, and web browsers that we
     use do not protect our data. In many cases, they intentionally give
     it to third party companies as part of the sprawling online
     advertising ecosystem. This only makes the NSA's task easier.
     Join us for a conversation between Edward Snowden and Christopher
     Soghoian, the American Civil Liberties Union's principal
     technologist, focused on the impact of the NSA's spying efforts on
     the technology community, and the ways in which technology can help
     to protect us from mass surveillance. The conversation will be
     moderated by Ben Wizner, who is director of the ACLU's Speech,
     Privacy & Technology Project and Edward Snowden's legal advisor.
     Audience members will have the opportunity to ask questions.
     Just as technology has enabled our modern surveillance state, so too
     can technology protect us. But regular users cannot make
     privacy-preserving tools themselves. The technology industry and the
     tech community can and must do more to secure the private data of
     the billions of people who rely on the tools and services that we
     build.
     Edward Snowden's revelations have launched a historic debate about
     surveillance practices and democratic controls, in which all three
     branches of government are actively and publicly engaging. But the
     technology community has too often been left out of the debate. It's
     time to fix that.

   We'll be blogging throughout, so make sure to check back here and
   follow us on Twitter (@ACLU and @ACLULive) to get the updates.

   And that's not all for our SXSW presence! The ACLU will be represented
   on three other panels focusing on NSA surveillance, what you can do to
   protect yourself, and the spy movies that are no longer the stuff of
   fantasy.

   If you happen to be at SXSW, visit us at our booth at the trade show
   March 9-12 to talk to our experts, learn more about our work on digital
   privacy and other civil liberties issues, get some of our useful
   resources and fabulous swag, and become an ACLU member.
