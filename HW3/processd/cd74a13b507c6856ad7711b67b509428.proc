Topics

   All Sessions Companies

Companies

   What’s different about building a company with products that integrate
   hardware, software, and data? Plenty, as both nimble startups and
   established power players are discovering. The Companies track will
   explore what’s working: from getting funding to design and marketing to
   moving from an early adopter market into the mainstream—and how to
   build a culture of continuous innovation to sustain and grow your
   business.
   Machines

Machines

   In a connected world, a machine is much more than a machine. To go from
   brilliant ideas to successful physical products, you need to understand
   more than just how to connect sensors to systems and hardware—you need
   to know how to intelligently architect complex systems, anticipate
   human interaction (and interaction between devices), master security
   issues, and design for a post-screen world.
   The Machines track shows you how to make intelligent things real; from
   design and prototyping to manufacturing and shipping.
   Society

Society

   Intelligent things—driven by software and made smarter by network
   connections—are poised to change the world. They have the potential to
   provide services more efficiently and less expensively, and to solve
   some of the most difficult problems our society faces—from helping the
   elderly stay in their own homes longer to conserving energy or
   improving air quality.
   Sessions in the Society track shows you how to build products and
   services that improve our communities, personal health, and the world
   economy.
   Foundations

Foundations

   By definition, the Solid space is interdisciplinary. Far beyond merely
   melding traditional hardware and software, successful products and
   platforms may incorporate sensors, radio waves, 3D printing, and novel
   materials and interfaces.
   The Foundations track will expand your notion of the possible, and show
   how radically new products can spring from re-imagining existing
   services, processes, and machines.
   Tools

Tools

   Success in the Solid space will take more than a visionary idea. It
   will also take some hard-core-technical, roll-up-your-sleeves
   development.
   Solid Tools, our most technical track, covers the protocols,
   technologies, and techniques that you need to understand to make your
   ideas become reality.
   Events

Events

   Network with attendees and presenters and see firsthand the best in
   intelligent hardware showcased at the onsite events happening at Solid.
