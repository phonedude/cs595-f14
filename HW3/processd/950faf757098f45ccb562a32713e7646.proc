   Tao Te Ching

   Written during the golden age of Chinese philosophy, and composed
   partly in prose and partly in verse, the Tao Te Ching is surely the
   most terse and economical of the world's great religious texts. In a

   or the Way -- an idea that in its ethical, practical, and spiritual
   dimensions has become essential to the life of China's civilization.

   Invisible Man
   by Ralph Ellison
   Invisible Man is a milestone in American literature, a book that has

   by an unknown writer, it remained on the bestseller list for sixteen
   weeks, won the National Book Award for fiction, and established Ralph
   Ellison as one of the key writers of the century. The nameless narrator
   of the novel describes growing up in a black community in the South,
   attending a Negro college from which he is expelled, moving to New York
   and becoming the chief spokesman of the Harlem branch of "the
   Brotherhood," and retreating amid violence and confusion to the
   basement lair of the Invisible Man he imagines himself to be.

   To Kill a Mockingbird
   by Harper Lee
   Lawyer Atticus Finch defends the real mockingbird of Harper Lee's
   classic, Puliter Prize-winning novel--a black man charged with the rape
   of a white woman. Through the eyes of Atticus's children, Scout and Jem
   Finch, Harper Lee explores with rich humor and unanswering honesty the
   irrationality of adult attitudes toward race and class in the Deep
   South of the 1930's.

   Journals of the Expedition

   tribes, and natural history of the trans-Mississippi West.

   writing words in her web.

   Romeo and Juliet
   by William Shakespeare
   Romeo and Juliet was the first drama in English to confer full tragic
   dignity on the agonies of youthful love. The lyricism that enshrines
   their death-marked devotion has made the lovers legendary in every
   language that possesses a literature.

   Truman
   by David G. McCullough
   This Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of an extraordinary president,
   Harry Truman, depicts the man who brought the country solidly into the
   20th century. Drawing from archival materials and extensive interviews,
   McCullough chronicles Truman's life, but it is Truman's emergence as a
   decisive and confident president that forms the heart of this book.
