Trope or fact? Technology creates more jobs than it destroys

Will automation beget a jobless wasteland or more stimulating, creative
employment? That's up for debate.

   Editor’s note: We’re trying something new here. I read this
   back-and-forth exchange between Malcolm Gladwell and Bill Simmons, and
   decided we should give it a try. Or, more accurately, since we’re
   already having plenty of back-and-forth email exchanges like that, we
   just need to start publishing them. My friend Doug Hill, author of Not
   So Fast: Thinking Twice About Technology, agreed to be a guinea pig and
   chat with me about a subject that’s on both of our minds (and a lot of
   other people’s): technology and the jobless recovery. We’ll be diving
   into this topic again next week in a debate hosted at Strata. This post
   was lightly edited on 2/6/14 for clarity.
     __________________________________________________________________

   STOGDILL: I saw this Tweet over the holidays while I was reading your
   book. I mean, I literally got distracted by this tweet while I was
   reading your book:

     Techno-utopian vision; bully for the economy, still not clear on
     jobs and wealth distribution. http://t.co/kPc8tfp17e cc /@jstogdill

     — Ari Gesher (@alephbass) January 3, 2014

   It felt like a natural moment of irony that I had to share with you. In
   the article Ari Gesher references in his Tweet, Vivek Whadwa obviously
   has an optimistic point of view, and Gesher was right to call out the
   inconsistency of his claims with our jobless recovery. I also recently
   read George Packer’s The Unwinding, his enlightening and disturbing
   look at the human stories behind our current malaise, and frankly it
   seems to better reflect the truth on the ground, at least if you get
   outside of the big five metro areas. But I suspect not a lot of techno
   optimists are spending time in places that won’t get 4G LTE for another
   year or two.

   I’m not going to ask you what you think of the article because I think
   I already know the answer. I do have a few things on my mind, though.
   Is our jobless recovery a new structural reality brought about by more
   and more pervasive automation? Are Norbert Wiener’s cybernetic
   predictions from the late 1940s finally coming true? He spent the 1950s
   telling politicians, union leaders, and anyone else who would listen
   that robots were the slave labor of the future, and that free men can’t
   compete with slaves for jobs. Or is creative destruction still working,
   but just taking some time to adjust this time around? And, if one is
   skeptical of technology, is it like being skeptical of tectonics? You
   can’t change it, so bolt your house down?

   HILL: Your timing is good. The day your email arrived the lead story in
   the news was the latest federal jobs report, which told us that the
   jobless “recovery” continues apace. Jobless, that is.

   The national conversation about the impact of automation on employment
   continues apace, too. Thomas Friedman devoted his New York Times
   column a couple of days ago to The Second Machine Age, the new book by
   Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee. They’re the professors from MIT
   whose previous book, Race Against the Machine, helped start that
   national conversation, in part because it demonstrated both an
   appreciation of automation’s advantages and an awareness that lots of
   workers could be left behind.

   I’ll try to briefly answer your questions, Jim, and then note a couple
   points that strike me as somewhat incongruous in the current
   discussion.

   Is our jobless economy a new structural reality brought about by more
   and more pervasive automation?

   Yes. Traditional economic theory holds that advances in technology
   create jobs rather than eliminate them. Even if that maxim were true in
   the past (and it’s not universally accepted), many economists believe
   the pace of innovation in automation today is overturning it. This puts
   automation’s most fervent boosters in the odd position of arguing that
   technological advance will disrupt pretty much
   everything except traditional economic theory.

   Are Norbert Wiener’s predictions from the late 1940s finally coming
   true? Or is creative destruction still working, but just taking some
   time to adjust this time around?

   Yes to both. Wiener’s predictions that automation would be used to
   undermine labor are coming true, and creative destruction is still at
   work. The problem is that we won’t necessarily like what the
   destruction creates.

   Now, about those incongruous points that bug me:
    1. First, a quibble over semantics. It’s convenient in our discussions
       about automation to use the word “robots,” but also misleading.
       Much, if not most, of the jobs displacement we’re seeing now is
       coming from systems and techniques that are facilitated by
       computers but less mechanical than the robots we typically envision
       assembling parts in factories. I don’t doubt that actual robots
       will be an ever-more-important force in the future, but they’ll be
       adding momentum to methods that corporations have been using for
       quite awhile now to increase productivity, even as they’re reducing
       payrolls.
    2. It’s commonly said that the answer to joblessness is education. Our
       employment problems will be solved by training people to do the
       sorts of jobs that the economy of the future will require. But wait
       a minute. If it’s true that the economy of the future will
       increasingly depend on automation, won’t we simply be educating
       people to do the sorts of jobs that eliminate more jobs?
    3. Techno optimists argue that our current employment problems are
       merely manifestations of a transition period on the way to a
       glorious future. “Let the robots take the jobs,” says Kevin
       Kelly, “and let them help us dream up new work that matters.”Even
       on his own terms, the future Kelly envisions seems more nightmarish
       than dreamlike. Everyone agrees automation is going to grow
       consistently more capable. As it does, Kelly says, robots will take
       over every job, including whatever new jobs we dream up to replace
       the previous jobs we lost to robots. If he’s right, we won’t be
       dreaming up new work that matters because we want to, but because
       we’ll have no choice. It will indeed be a race against the
       machines, and machines don’t get tired.

   One more thing. You asked if being skeptical of technology is like
   being skeptical of tectonics. My first thought was to wonder whether
   anybody is really skeptical of tectonics, but given the polls on global
   warming, I guess anything is possible — more possible, I think, than a
   reversal of the robot revolution. So yeah, go ahead and bolt the house
   down.

   STOGDILL: Let me think where to start. My problem in this conversation
   is that I find myself arguing both sides of the question in my head,
   which makes it hard to present a coherent argument to you.

   First, let me just say that I enter this discussion with some natural
   inclination toward a Schumpeterian point of view. In 1996, I visited a
   Ford electronics plant in Pennsylvania that was going through its own
   automation transformation. They had recently equipped the plant with
   then-new surface mount soldiering robots and redesigned the electronic
   modules that they produced there to take advantage of the tech. The
   remaining workers each tended two robots instead of placing parts on
   the boards themselves.

   Except for this one guy. For some reason I’ve long forgotten, one of
   the boards they manufactured still required a single through-board
   capacitor, and a worker at that station placed capacitors in holes all
   day. Every 10 seconds for eight hours, a board would arrive in front of
   him, he would drop a capacitor’s legs through two little holes, push it
   over a bit to make sure it was all the way through, and then it was off
   to the next station to be soldiered. It was like watching Lucy in the
   Chocolate Factory.

   I was horrified — but when I talked to him, he was bound and determined
   to keep that job from being automated. I simply couldn’t understand it.
   Why wouldn’t he want to upgrade his skills and run one of the more
   complex machines? Even now, when I’m more sympathetic to his plight,
   I’m still mystified that he could stand to continue doing that job when
   something else might have been available.

   Yet, these days I find myself losing patience with the reflexive trope
   “of course technology creates more jobs than it destroys; it always
   has. What are you, a Luddite?” The Earth will keep rotating around the
   sun, too; it always has, right up until the sun supernovas, and then it
   won’t.

   Which isn’t to say that the robots are about to supernova, but that
   arguments that depend on the past perpetuating into the future are not
   arguments — they’re wishes. (See also, China’s economy will always keep
   growing at a torrid rate despite over-reliance on investment at the
   expense of consumption because it always has). And I just can’t really
   take anyone seriously who makes an argument like that if they can’t
   explain the mechanisms that will continue to make it true.

   So, to my thinking, this boils down to a few key questions. Was that
   argument even really true in the past, at least the recent past? If it
   was, is the present enough like the past that we can assume that, with
   re-training, we’ll find work for the people being displaced by this
   round of automation? Or, is it possible that something structurally
   different is happening now? And, even if we still believe in the
   creative part of creative destruction, what destructive pace can our
   society absorb and are there policies that we should be enacting to
   manage and ease the transition?

   This article does a nice job of explaining what I think might be
   different this time with its description of the “cognitive elite.” As
   automation takes the next layer of jobs at the current bottom, we
   humans are asked to do more and more complex stuff, higher up the value
   hierarchy. But what if we can’t? Or, if not enough of us can? What if
   it’s not a matter of just retraining — what if we’re just not talented
   enough? The result would surely be a supply/demand mismatch at the high
   end of the cognitive scale, and we’d expect a dumbbell shape to develop
   in our income distribution curve. Or, in other words, we’d expect new
   Stanford grads going to Google to make $100K and everyone else to work
   at Walmart. And more and more, that seems like it’s happening.

   Anyway, right now I’m all question, no answer. Others are suggesting
   that this jobless recovery has nothing to do with automation. It’s the
   (lack of) unions, stupid. I really don’t know, but I think we — meaning
   we technologists and engineers — need to be willing to ask the question
   “is something different this go-round?” and not just roll out the old
   history-is-future tropes.

   We’re trying to create that conversation at least a bit by holding an
   Oxford-style debate at our next Strata conference. The statement we’ll
   be debating is: “Technology creates more jobs than it destroys,” and
   I’ll be doing my best to moderate in an even-handed way.

   By the way, your point that it’s “not just robots” is well taken. I was
   talking to someone recently who works in the business process
   automation space, and they’ve begun to refer to those processes as
   “robots,” too — even though they have no physical manifestation. I was
   using the term in that broad sense, too.

   HILL: In your last email you made two points in passing that I’d like
   to agree with right off the bat.

   One is your comment that, when it comes to predicting what impact
   automation will have on employment, you find yourself “arguing both
   sides of the question.” Technology always has and always will cut both
   ways, so we can be reasonably certain that, whatever happens, both
   sides of the question are going to come into play. That’s about the
   only certainty we have, really, which is why I also liked it when you
   said, “I’m all question, no answer.” That’s true of all of us, whether
   we admit it or not.

   We are obligated, nonetheless, to take what Norbert Wiener called “the
   imaginative forward glance.” For what it’s worth then, my answer to
   your question, “Is something different this go-round?” — by which you
   meant, even if it was once true that technological advancement created
   more rather than fewer jobs, that may no longer be true, given the
   pace, scale, and scope of the advances in automation we’re witnessing
   today — is yes and no.

   That is, yes, I do think the scope and scale of technological change
   we’re seeing today presents us with challenges of a different order of
   magnitude than what we’ve faced previously. At the same time, I think
   it’s also true that we can look to the past to gain some sense of where
   automation might be taking us in the future.

   In the articles on this issue you and I have traded back and forth over
   the past several weeks, I notice that two of the most optimistic, as
   far as our automated future is concerned, ran in the Washington Post. I
   want to go on record as denying any suspicion that Jeff Bezos had
   anything to do with that.

   Still, the most recent of those articles, James Bessen’s piece on the
   lessons to be learned from the experience of America’s first
   industrial-scale textile factories (“Will robots steal our jobs? The
   humble loom suggests not”) was so confidently upbeat that I’m sure
   Bezos would have approved. It may be useful, for that reason, to take a
   closer look at some of Bessen’s claims.

   To hear him tell it, the early mills in Waltham and Lowell,
   Massachusetts, were 19th-century precursors of the cushy working
   conditions enjoyed in Silicon Valley today. The mill owners recruited
   educated, middle-class young women from surrounding farm communities
   and supplied them with places to live, houses of worship, a lecture
   hall, a library, a savings bank, and a hospital.

   “Lowell marked a bold social experiment,” Bessen says, “for a society
   where, not so long before, the activity of young, unmarried women had
   been circumscribed by the Puritan establishment.”

   The suggestion that the Lowell mills were somehow responsible for
   liberating young women from the clutches of Puritanism is questionable
   — the power of the Puritan church had been dissipating for all sorts of
   reasons for more than a century before factories appeared on the banks
   of the Merrimack — but let that go.

   It is true that, in the beginning, the mills offered young women from
   middle-class families an unprecedented opportunity for a taste of
   freedom before they married and settled down. Because their parents
   were relatively secure financially, they could afford to leave them
   temporarily behind without leaving them destitute. That’s a long way
   from saying that the mills represented some beneficent “social
   experiment” in which management took a special interest in cultivating
   the well-being of the women they employed.

   Thomas Dublin’s Women at Work: The Transformation of Work and Community
   in Lowell, Massachusetts, 1826-1860 tells a different story. Women were
   recruited to staff the mills, Dublin says, because they were an
   available source of labor (men were working the farms or employed in
   smaller-scale factories in the cities) and because they could be paid
   less than men. All supervisory positions in the mills were held by men.
   Also contrary to Bessen’s contention, the women weren’t hired because
   they were smart enough to learn specialized skills. Women tended the
   machines; they didn’t run them. “To the extent that jobs did not
   require special training, strength or endurance, or expose operatives
   to the risk of injury,” Dublin says, “women were employed.”

   How much time they had to enjoy the amenities supposedly provided by
   management is another question. According to Dublin, mill workers put
   in 12 hours a day, six days a week, with only three regular holidays a
   year. As the number of mills increased, so did the pressure to make
   laborers more productive. Speedups and stretch-outs were imposed. A
   speedup meant the pace of the machinery was increased, a stretch-out
   meant that each employee was required to tend additional pieces of
   machinery. Periodic cuts in piece wages were another fact of mill life.

   Because of their middle-class backgrounds, and because they were
   accustomed to pre-industrial standards of propriety, the first
   generation of women felt empowered enough to protest these conditions,
   to little avail. Management offered few concessions, and many women
   left. The generation of women who replaced them were less likely to
   protest. Most had fled the Irish famine and had no middle-class homes
   to return to.

   I go into this in some detail, Jim, because it’s important to
   acknowledge what automation’s fundamental purpose has always been: to
   increase management profits. Bold social experiments to benefit workers
   haven’t figured prominently in the equation.

   It’s true that factory jobs have, in the long run, raised the standard
   of living for millions of workers (the guy you met in the Ford
   electronics plant comes to mind), but we shouldn’t kid ourselves that
   they’ve necessarily been pleasant, fulfilling ways to make a living.
   Nor should we kid ourselves that management won’t use automation to
   eliminate jobs in the future, if automation offers opportunities to
   increase profits.

   We also need to consider whether basing our economy on the production
   and sale of ever-higher piles of consumables, however they’re
   manufactured, is a model the planet can sustain any longer. That’s the
   essential dilemma we face, I think. We must have jobs, but they have to
   be directed toward some other purpose.

   I realize I haven’t addressed, at least directly, any of the questions
   posed in your email. Sorry about that — the Bessen article got under my
   skin.

   STOGDILL: That Bessen article did get under your skin, didn’t it? Well,
   anger in the face of ill-considered certainty is reasonable as far as
   I’m concerned. Unearned certainty strikes me as the disease of our age.

   Reading your response, I had a whole swirl of things running through my
   head. Starting with, “Does human dignity require meaningful
   employment?” I mean, separate from the economic considerations, what if
   we’re just wired to be happier when we grow or hunt for our own food? —
   and will the abstractions necessary to thrive in an automation economy
   satisfy those needs?

   Also, with regard to your comments about how much stuff do we need —
   does that question even really matter? Is perpetual sustainability on a
   planet where the Second Law of Thermodynamics holds sway even possible?
   Anyway, that diversion can wait for another day.

   Let me just close this exchange by focusing for just one moment on your
   point that productivity gains have always been about increasing
   management profits. Of course they have. I don’t think that has ever
   been in question. Productivity gains are where every increase in wealth
   ever has come from (except for that first moment when someone stumbled
   on something useful bubbling out of the ground), and profit is how is
   how we incent investment in productivity. The question is how widely
   gains will be shared.

   Historically, that argument has been about the mechanisms (and
   politics) to appropriately distribute productivity gains between
   capital and labor. That was the fundamental argument of the
   20th century, and we fought and died over it — and for maybe 30 years,
   reached maybe a reasonable answer.

   But what if we are automating to a point where there will be no
   meaningful link between labor and capital? There will still be labor,
   of course, but it will be doing these abstract “high value” things that
   have nothing whatsoever to do with the bottom three layers of Maslov’s
   hierarchy. In a world without labor directly tied to capital and its
   productivity gains, can we expect the mechanisms of the 20th century to
   have any impact at all? Can we even imagine a mechanism that flows the
   value produced by robots to the humans they sidelined? Can unemployed
   people join a union?

   We didn’t answer these questions, but thanks for exploring them with
   me.

       As someone who agrees that technological unemployment poses
       entirely new challenges to the meaning and availability of work, I
       thoroughly enjoyed this conversation. I suggest that, to begin the
       process of insuring that the productivity increases redound to
       everyone, we explore Basic Income Guarantee and/or Conditional Cash
       Transfers both of which have already been instituted in various
       countries. We also have to transform our education system so that
       children are trained not to be cogs in a machine and consumers, but
       life-long learners who can pursue their passions.
          + Jim S
            Thanks Gisele. I agree, those are really interesting trends.
            VERY difficult to imagine them in our current political
            climate.
               o Gisele Huff
                 Indeed, Jim, but 10 years ago,, it would have been
                 difficult to imagine that gay marriage would now be legal
                 in several states and marijuana in two.
                    # Cole Thompson
                      Spot on. I can recall, not that long ago, smart and
                      reasonable people saying, well, a black man could
                      never be President of course. Not in our lifetime.
                      I’ll just add regarding a Basic Income (I prefer
                      Citizen’s Income) that it’s not hard to justify.
                      Take all the arguments about why the children of the
                      wealthy are entitled to the proceeds of their
                      inheritance, by dint of the hard work of the clan’s
                      founding patriarchs, etc. Just substitute “citizens”
                      for children of the wealthy, “production from
                      robots” for inheritance, and “our ancestors” for
                      founding patriarchs.
                         @ Gisele Huff
                           I like your justification for a Citizens’
                           Income. It’s spot on as well. Is there a way
                           that we can connect off line?
                         @ Cole Thompson
                           Let me see what I can do, I want to respect the
                           privacy rules of Disqus, etc.
                           FWIW I’d say a core question of our age is
                           “ownership.” As currently constituted, in
                           modern civilization ownership of assets (real
                           or virtual) trumps everything else. It’s
                           tempting to say that doesn’t work, rip it out
                           and replace with something else.
                           However…putting one’s pragmatic thinking cap
                           on…I’m inclined to say that evolutionary change
                           is more likely to actually get anywhere. So I
                           think that realistically the most do-able
                           reforms evolve things, rather than break and
                           replace. If we can more fairly spread out who
                           “owns” robots and AI, the problem of humans
                           being outcompeted by machines tends to solve
                           itself.
                           What we do *not* want is a continuation of the
                           current dynamic, where ownership is ever more
                           concentrated. Or if we collectively go that
                           route, then I don’t see an alternative to heavy
                           VAT taxes, etc. to fund Basic Income/ transfer
                           payments to the have nots.
                         @ Gisele Huff
                           My son and I are currently exploring both
                           technological unemployment and universal basic
                           income so your comments are right on line with
                           this. We believe that bringing the two concepts
                           together will be the beginning of a long-term
                           but critically important and urgent “movement”
                           to change the way America (and the world) does
                           “business.”

       Great discussion.
       One thing I notice about this topic in general is that no one ever
       gets around to what the next big thing will be and it is that
       people will be doing in that next big area of “human” endeavor.
       It’s pretty clear that regardless of the subject area and whatever
       successful new industry comes up, to be successful it will be
       heavily automated from the earliest days.
       You don’t get labor bubbles that absorb displaced workers from
       that.
       Here I’ll actually put forward an industry that might be important
       in the future ;) Biotech.
       Anyone want to suggest there are going to be tons of jobs for
       non-elite workers in this field?

       I really liked this discussion.
       I would just like to add that surely if mechanisation makes
       production/calculation cheaper then surely we should compensate by
       valuing more those areas of work where humans are required.
       For instance, why do we pay so little to those who care for our
       elderly whilst its such a social necessity (and growing)? Because
       they aren’t rare skilled is the obvious answer. Currently this is
       the economic reality but its not inevitable, for much of the last
       century labour was organised and could demand minimum pay and
       standards – reserve army of labour or not.
       In a working political democracy gains in productivity would be
       displaced across society, we would hire more people to do research,
       to care, to rebuild our infrastructure. In our current democracy we
       simply abandon a section of society and let the gains all flow up
       to the top 1% and sit offshore or accrue in the value of property
       or art.
          + Jim S
            There are clearly a bunch of things at work here, and
            narrowing on just the technical automation story is
            constraining. There are also lots of “state capture” kinds of
            arguments to make as the wealth->power->wealth->power feedback
            loop does its thing.
     * joeraimondo
       Along with the impact of technology, I think there is a a
       concomitant effect of the ‘financialization of everything’ that
       presents a new variable in the discussion. With enterprise
       decisions increasingly driven by the exigencies of capital —
       whether demand for increased return on assets or from increasing
       focus across the board of the opportunities afforded by various
       means of financial engineering — it’s pretty clear that ‘the
       employment problem’ can be seen as a function of companies no
       longer having any commitment to capitalize on or invest in their
       workforce. Such investments look bad to the capital markets; for
       example, I read the other day how the Japanese were having a hard
       time stimulating return from their public companies because they
       had “too much commitment to their workforce and their existing
       partners.” Well I suppose Wall Street has driven out all that
       abhorrent behavior in the US, but at the cost of labor playing any
       kind of substantial role in setting strategy, other than in the
       areas where there is a shortage (and even those Silicon Valley
       titans were recently called out for colluding to protect their
       privileged role in the tight market for high-tech skills.
          + Jim S
            Really interesting point.
          + DougHill25
            Yes, I agree, an excellent point. A corollary of the
            ‘financialization
            of everything” is a management tendency to see workers as
            figures in an
            efficiency formula — i.e., as part of the machinery — rather
            than as
            human beings. At which point dehumanization becomes a
            byproduct of automation (as in Chaplin’s “Modern Times”).
     * loreleikelly
       Thanks for collecting these important thoughts together in an
       article. This conversation is timely. I wish it were true that
       automation would allow humans to re direct their energy to work
       that matters–but here’s the problem–work that matters or work for
       common goods is often paid for through a negotiated social contract
       called taxation by government–and government is under continual
       attack in the USA. As someone inside the Beltway, its the
       innovative stuff that gets axed by the sequester, the stuff on the
       margins, the progressive “stuff that matters” to move society
       forward. Meanwhile, old obsolete programs embed themselves even
       more comfortably inside the budget process (getting rid of earmarks
       made this worse, btw, though it was very satisfying to talk about)
       I did defense budget work on Capitol Hill for years–why are we
       still paying for missile defense again? The Stealth bomber was
       defeated by flocks of geese…The Joint Strike Fighter, btw, probably
       couldn’t even fly in extreme weather–a major threat that we’re
       going to have to contend with over the coming years. The New Yorker
       just ran a fantastic piece on how the entire process of
       policymaking can be gamed by a commercial
       interest…http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2014/02/10/140210fa_fac
       t_aviv?currentPage=all “work that matters” would be figuring out a
       way for people to strive for a transparent, accountable public
       square where living things are valued more. I work in tech now, and
       something I would say to all of us who are delving into this
       question of balance and prosperity–the pot of gold at the end of
       the rainbow in civic life is health and inclusion…its giving people
       a destiny and not just a fate, you choose one and the other chooses
       you. You can’t monetize civics and not become a hideous distortion
       of democracy–In the workplace, technology could lead to a new
       organizational model–the horizontal workplace dictatorship–and
       you’ll be lucky if the boss is a benevolent one.
          + Jim S
            Great points. And you’re so right about the fact that killing
            earmarks was actually a net negative.
            “you can’t monetize civics.” Well said.
     * http://singularity-2045.org/ Singularity Utopia
       Jobs turbulence circa 2014 is merely an issue of people failing to
       realise how everything in the future will be free. Every job will
       be completely automated in the future. The automation in
       combination with technology becoming ultra-efficient will entail
       resources becoming essentially limitless, which is why everything
       will be free, scarcity will be abolished (note Drexler “Radical
       Abundance” and Diamandis/Kotler “Abundance” for an intro to these
       issues).
       So the future means nobody will need to work and everything will be
       free. The transition to this state is basic income, which is a
       non-withdrawable welfare payment given without any conditions or
       obligations whatsoever for the recipient, it’s basically free money
       without any catches. Basic income seems very radical but it is
       closer then you think. MLK advocated it and there is currently a
       pending Swiss referendum for the possible implementation of it.
       On the issue of automation, you may ask if there is any evidence of
       this. Where is Wall-E? We already have the Roomba and Nao is being
       tentatively used to help elderly people and autistic children.
       Google recently bought Boston Dynamics, which has a variety of
       notable robots. Google is also investing heavily in artificial
       intelligence, note the recent DeepMind acquisition of the input of
       Ray Kurzweil. Intel is in the process of launching a competitor to
       Siri, called Jarvis; and then there is the classic IBM Watson who
       won Jeopardy! IBM have opened up Watson to app developers. So
       regarding all the automaton, AI and robotics, the question is have
       we reached the limit of progress or have we hardly scratched the
       surface, is this the beginning or the end?
          + Jim S
            You may be making the mistake of thinking technology and
            economics occur in a vacuum with no relationship to humans and
            politics. Also, not having jobs isn’t necessarily the same
            thing as distributed abundance.
               o http://singularity-2045.org/ Singularity Utopia
                 The ignorance of politicians is very problematic, but
                 abundance and no jobs is inevitable, eventually. The
                 question is can we avoid the turbulence regarding
                 political ignorance? Can we achieve a smooth or turbulent
                 transition into a free future?
                 Basic income is being debated in various aspects of the
                 media, there is even a Swiss referendum (pending) to
                 implement it. Political ignorance can be overcome via
                 public awareness. Automation will reach a point where it
                 is clear all jobs are being eroded, hopefully via insight
                 (intelligent forward-planning), we can implement basic
                 income before a disastrous situation occurs.
                 The economic reality of the future is clear, it’s a free
                 future, but similar to politicians economists may not
                 realise it. Resources will become more abundant via
                 technology thus the only opposition to our free future is
                 mere ignorance, blind loyalty to tradition.
                    # Cole Thompson
                      Good points, there is the Swiss referendum, and
                      further some German politicians have toyed with the
                      idea of an “unconditional basic income.”
                      The notion of a citizen’s income has featured in
                      “steady state economics” for a while. I won’t say I
                      speak for everyone in the SSE community, but some of
                      us have had discussions on pragmatic transition to a
                      citizen’s income via VAT taxes on robot output and
                      more.
                      Some of this is captured in a color slide
                      presentation here:

                      “the only opposition to our free future is mere
                      ignorance, blind loyalty to tradition.”
                      Seriously, you really should read the Italian
                      futurists of the 1930’s. You’ll find their certainty
                      and “Future, hell yeah!” vibe reassuring.
                      Also, can I just summarize your argument here?
                      1) A singularity is a coordinate in space time where
                      the math breaks down. Where things go so non-linear
                      we can’t predict anything.
                      2) I know that the singularity is coming in 2045.
                      Precisely.
                      3) After the singularity, on the other side of that
                      unknowable boundary, we are going to have no
                      material needs and our political system will
                      magically line up with the new reality of perpetual
                      abundance.
                      4) Thus sayeth the Lord. QED.
                      Did I get it right? :)
                         @ http://singularity-2045.org/ Singularity Utopia
                           1) There are various schools of Singularity
                           thought (note how “MIRI intelligence” lists the
                           three “major” schools). My view of the
                           Singularity is a modernist view (see my article
                           “Singularity Defined and Refined,” which is a
                           beginning for my refutation regarding how the
                           traditional Singularity theory is flawed). The
                           Singularity is a newish theory, currently
                           evolving. Basically my viewpoint is the
                           unpredictable outlook is wrong, there will be
                           no event horizon beyond which you cannot see.
                           2) 2045 is a deadline, a latest date regarding
                           when the Singularity should have occurred by.
                           It is a conservative date, cautious, based on
                           the evidence of progress, to avoid anticlimax.
                           Very probably the Singularity will happen
                           before 2045.
                           3) Again I state the Singularity is not
                           unfathomable or unknowable. Looking at various
                           examples of progress it is easy to logically
                           predict everything will be free no later than
                           year 2045. For example in 1983 mobile phones
                           were priced at $3,700 approximately whereas in
                           2014 a significantly more sophisticated phone
                           costs only $6. I have responded to you with
                           greater depth on my Medium post: “No Jobs In
                           the Future! Everything will be FREE!”
                           4) You are not wrong to link
                           Singularity-traditionalism to the Lord.
                           Mysterious event horizons are very much the
                           realm of cosmic-teapots, but
                           Singularity-modernism, my viewpoint, is very
                           atheist, very clear without any hand-waving
                           unfathomableness.
                           So you got almost everything wrong :)

       Let’s expand this idea to something that’s inevitably coming, which
       is that in the not too distant future, computers will likely
       design/program themselves and all those who currently think their
       jobs are secure because of their intellect and engineering/coding
       prowess might find themselves in the same position of factory
       workers who have watched automation reduce jobs in their workspace.
       Programmers will become the “auto worker/plant workers” who will
       likely unionize at some point only to see their numbers steadily
       decrease and once again we’ll have an argument over what value we
       see in labor…and why aren’t we just teaching these old dogs new
       tricks?
       There is certainly incredible power in automation and it does
       reduce our costs which are later passed on to consumers, but the
       cost of that is the erosion of the middle class. The new middle
       class seems to be the tech worker who is paid a very good wage for
       the work they do…but we question our values…
       What is the value of work that pays a fair and comfortable wage for
       a job well done and how will we measure our own value when we keep
       moving the method by which we measure that?
       As we get older and we face greater longevity and a future where
       keeping up in a fast paced work force becomes harder and
       harder…what place will any of us have in that? I guess since I’ve
       always been on the ideas/marketing side of technology…I’ll may be
       okay, but it doesn’t look good for everyone else. Best to start
       saving now for a very early retirement…er…redundancy.
