   Shreyas Joshi originally shared to Mathematics (Videos/Pictures):

   Ever wondered how a sewing machine worked, how a needle going up and
   down, tracing the same path again and again can pass a thread through a
   piece of fabric in a chain like pattern. This gif explains the simple
   mechanics and a little bit mathematics behind a sewing machine.
   The needle tears through the fabric, beneath it, a circular hook
   rotates in one direction, capturing the yellow thread from above and
   looping it around the green thread, this one reeling from the bobbin
   below. The two threads interlock around the layers of fabric, binding
   them to one another.
   Definition extracted form Wikipedia: A sewing machine is a machine used
   to stitch fabric and other materials together with thread. Sewing
   machines were invented during the first Industrial Revolution to
   decrease the amount of manual sewing work performed in clothing
   companies. Since the invention of the first working sewing machine,
   generally considered to have been the work of Englishman Thomas Saint
   in 1790, the sewing machine has greatly improved the efficiency and
   productivity of the clothing industry.
