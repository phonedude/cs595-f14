Exclusive: Google to Buy Artificial Intelligence Startup DeepMind for $400M

   Google is shelling out $400 million to buy a secretive artificial
   intelligence company called DeepMind.

   Google confirmed the deal after Re/code inquired about it, but declined
   to specify a price.

   Based in London, DeepMind was founded by games prodigy and
   neuroscientist Demis Hassabis, along with Shane Legg and Mustafa
   Suleyman.

   This is in large part an artificial intelligence talent acquisition,
   and Google CEO Larry Page led the deal himself, sources said. According
   to online bios, Hassabis in particular is quite a talent, a child
   prodigy in chess who was later called “probably the best games player
   in history” by the Mind Sports Olympiad.

   DeepMind has only a landing page for a website where it describes its
   business as building learning algorithms for simulations, e-commerce
   and games. Profiles on LinkedIn indicate the company is about three
   years old.

   Sources said Founders Fund is a major investor in DeepMind, along with
   Horizons Ventures. Skype and Kazaa developer Jaan Tallinn was an
   investor and adviser (not a founder, as we initially described him).

   Other Google AI experts include Jeff Dean and Anna Patterson. The
   company also recently hired Geoffrey Hinton part-time.

   Update: Though DeepMind may not be a household name in tech, sources in
   the artificial intelligence community describe the company as a
   formidable AI player and say it has been aggressively recruiting in the
   space. One source said DeepMind has a team of at least 50 people and
   has secured more than $50 million in funding. This person described
   DeepMind as “the last large independent company with a strong focus on
   artificial intelligence,” and said it competed with companies like
   Google, Facebook and Baidu for talent.

   Multiple sources said the company has been developing a variety of
   approaches to AI, and applying them to various potential products
   including a recommendation system for e-commerce.

   It is obvious that Google is missing intelligence, but do they know
   that you can't buy it for money?

   Tying this to the Nest acquisition, and Perkins' comment indicating he
   finally understands how bad the Holocaust was, my "99% concern" with
   all of this is how any of this BIG money supposed to "Trickle Down"?
   How does this kind of wildly ridiculous valuation benefit any bottom
   folks? It's OK if it doesn't or that Trickle Down is nothing more than
   weak theory, and that none of this will ever reach the floor.  I can
   handle that.

   I'm just tired of hearing that it eventually will.

   If Google does not kill the Nest, and somehow manages to figure out and
   get into the hardware business without screwing it up, I am sure some
   of the newly minted millionaires at Deep can now afford a $299
   thermostat.

   Man, Google looks to making all the right moves. They will completely
   transform the human mind soon here.

   I am the inventor of the laser level 5836081. My latest invention is a
   device that will not allow any  video source to record the person with
   said device.  Bizarre as this may  sound...it works perfectly.  I will
   not license to Google due to the aggressive  direction I feel this
   mammoth is leaning.

   It's unconstitutional for the US government to track their citizens
   each and every move. But if the government gets selective data directly
   from a private enterprise (Google), it is perfectly lawful. That may
   explain why the FTC and USDOJ seem to be turning a blind eye to
   Google's aggressive expansion into areas that will further increase
   their capabilities to monitor individuals.

   This could be Google's response to IBM's stepped up investment in
   Watson.  Will be interesting to follow....

   Interesting - I wonder if there was a bidding war. Does DeepMind have
   any government contracts? I can't imagine Google buying more AI so they
   can make search better. ;-)

   @Screwgle I would love to hear more about it. More of us have to stand
   up to this BEAST of an electronic assault. It takes courage to do it.
   It's Rainmaking Time!

   @SteveMahoney This more likely means the end of free will as we know
   it. We will be totally controlled if we don't stop it now.
