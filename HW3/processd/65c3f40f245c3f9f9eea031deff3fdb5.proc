Code for America Fellows Connecting Citizens and City Hall

   Miriam Sitz
   on 4 February, 2014 at 05:01

   eg

   Sitz-2014 Sitz-2014 If some of the nation’s sharpest young minds spent
   a year working together to find a technological answer to a real and
   specific problem facing San Antonio, what might be accomplished? Thanks
   to Code for America, the 80/20 Foundation and the City, we’ll soon find
   out.

   Last night on the 11th floor of the Weston Centre, the collaborative
   co-working space Geekdom played host the kick off reception of Code for
   America’s fellowship program in San Antonio. Code for America (CfA) is
   a national nonprofit that fosters civic technological innovation by
   partnering with local governments and organizations to create new tools
   and solutions to age-old problems.

   The arrival of the program in San Antonio means citizens will be given
   easy-to-use web-based interfaces to access government records and
   information if the CfA team is successful with partnering with city
   officials to design and build user-friendly tools. Public access to the
   vast databases maintained by the city would be a major advance in
   transparency on the part of local government. Code for America believes
   such enhanced public access will help build more trusting and
   productive relationships between taxpayers and public servants.

   IMG_0776 IMG_0776 The fellowship program places small teams of
   service-minded developers, designers and product managers in cities
   across the nation. The three-person CfA team assigned to San Antonio
   will work for 11 months, collaborating with local governments and
   residents both here in town and back at their headquarters in San
   Francisco, to build an app that tackles a local problem.

   In the past, CfA fellows have improved access to social services,
   proposed alternatives to incarceration and designed new avenues for
   public input.

   “It’s undeniable that our city is a city on the rise,” said District 1
   Councilman Diego Bernal at the beginning of last night’s reception. The
   uptick in organizations and endeavors that focus knowledge and energy
   in the city, such as Geekdom, he said, indicates a positive trend for
   future growth and increased brain gain. “This is not us trying to be
   someone else,” he added; “we’re trying to be the best version of
   ourselves.”

   Speaking to the three CfA fellows in the room, Bernal concluded:
   “There’s an opportunity here to contribute and make this place the best
   version of itself that it can be. I really believe in my heart that you
   guys are really going to help us accelerate that process.

   So who are these fellows? Thirty participants spread over ten locations
   (eight US cities, Rhode Island, and San Juan, Puerto Rico) comprise the
   2014 fellowship class.

   Software engineer Amy Mok has a “passion for space and social impact.”
   A graduate of both UC Berkeley (BA computer science) and Carnegie
   Mellon University (MS software engineering), she most recently worked
   with Lockheed Martin and hails from San Francisco.

   “Our team will go into the community and we’ll go into city hall and
   we’ll listen and learn,” she said, “and we’ll solve problems together.”

   David Leonard, a southern California native, is a project manager and
   designer. He shared the basic question CfA fellows ask: “How do we
   create the easiest experience for people to interact with their
   government?” The answer to that query gets at the root of the CfA
   mission. “The key really is making people feel like they’re part of the
   system and they own the system, not just that they’re on the outside
   looking in.”

   As an example, Leonard described how in 2012, fellows in New Orleans
   created an app called “Blight Status” that accomplished this mission by
   allowing regular citizens to become an easy but integral part of the
   process of identifying (and eventually rehabilitating) blighted
   properties.

   Web designer and developer Maya Benari of Los Angeles works to make a
   positive impact ton the world by creating beautiful and functional
   online spaces. “The way people interact with each other has changed,”
   she said. “The way government interacts with their citizens is still
   evolving. We want to help you, the government and the people of San
   Antonio, to work better together.”

   Hugh Miller, chief technology officer of the City of San Antonio,
   explained that the fellows had their first meeting with city staff and
   leadership and hinted at two potential projects they could explore: an
   application that allows users to see what city services are available
   to a specific address or a volunteer management system that allows
   citizens who want to volunteer to view available opportunities.

   In conjunction with the City, the 80/20 Foundation, established
   by Rackspace Hosting co-founder and chairman Graham Weston, provided
   support for San Antonio’s participation in CfA. Weston and 80/20
   Foundation executive director Lorenzo Gomez both gave remarks at the
   reception.

   A major proponent of entrepreneurship and innovation in San Antonio,
   Weston described how code affects every aspect of our lives, using the
   pizza delivery business as an example. Ten years ago, he said, Domino’s
   Pizza had to orchestrate delivery drivers, make pizzas and that was
   about it. Today, over half of the orders they receive come in through a
   mobile app.

   “This city is changing into what we want to make it into,” Weston said.
   “We’re becoming a city that you personally influence the future of, and
   that’s really exciting. … It is an honor to have Code for America here
   because code is going to change our city, just like code changed
   Domino’s Pizza. I think the more citizens who understand that, the
   closer [they are to understanding] how the world is going to change in
   the future.”

   Weston then introduced Tim O’Reilly, founder and CEO of O’Reilly Media
   and widely considered the “top publisher of geek learning materials in
   the world.” In O’Reilly’s words, “We’re mostly a company concerned with
   finding interesting people and then taking what they’ve learned and
   spreading it to other people.” He emphasized how Code for America’s
   focuses on helping people more than creating technology by first
   understanding user needs and then solving problems.

   O’Reilly described a conversation he had with CfA Jennifer Pahlka, who
   commented on the amount of distrust some people feel toward government.
   He relayed the question Pahlka then asked him: “What if people felt
   about government the way they feel about their iPhone?” A
   transformative user experience,  he said, one that is seamless,
   attractive and approachable, is what the CfA fellows are aiming to
   create for San Antonio.

   Mok, Leonard and Benari will spend the next four weeks here in San
   Antonio, working with city staff and the community to identify
   challenges and needs before returning to the San Francisco CfA office
   with the other nine fellowship teams. “What’s really unique about this
   program is that our job isn’t to consult or to come in and fix an
   assigned problem,” Leonard told the Rivard Report. “Our job is to work
   with the community and figure out what they need.”

   The fellows welcome feedback on issues facing San Antonio. Email your
   input to sanantonio@codeforamerica.org.

   Want more? Watch CfA founder Jennifer Pahlka’s 2012 TED talk, in which
   she describes how citizenship and technology interact and how the
   internet has the ability to “fundamentally [reshape] the way government
   can work.”

       Could this have come from within? Do we really need an
       intervention?
       I really like what CfA is doing however I am disappointed. It feels
       like a band-aid. San Antonians should have taken the initiative.
