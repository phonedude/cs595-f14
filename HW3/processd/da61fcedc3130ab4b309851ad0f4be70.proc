   Survey: YouTube Stars More Popular Than August 5, 2014 | 09:00AM PT

Susanne Ault

   U.S. teenagers are more enamored with YouTube stars than they are the
   biggest celebrities in film, TV and music.

   SEE MORE: From the August 05, 2014 issue of Variety

   That’s the surprising result of a survey Variety commissioned in July
   that found the five most influential figures among Americans ages 13-18
   are all YouTube faves, eclipsing mainstream celebs including Jennifer
   Lawrence and Seth Rogen. The highest-ranking figures were Smosh, the
   online comedy team of Ian Andrew Hecox and Anthony Padilla, both 26.

   Despite having minimal exposure in the mainstream media, another comedy
   duo, known as the Fine Bros., Benny and Rafi, finished a close second,
   followed by the Swedish videogamer who has the most subscribers on all
   of YouTube, Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg — otherwise known as PewDiePie.
   Interestingly, the highest-ranking non-YouTuber is Paul Walker, who
   tragically died in a car accident late in 2013.

   The survey, conducted for Variety by celebrity brand strategist
   Jeetendr Sehdev, asked 1,500 respondents a battery of questions
   assessing how 20 well-known personalities stacked up in terms of
   approachability, authenticity and other criteria considered aspects of
   their overall influence. Half the 20 were drawn from the
   English-language personalities with the most subscribers and video
   views on YouTube, the other half were represented by the celebrities
   with the highest Q scores among U.S. teens aged 13-17, as of March.

   A score was then assigned to each YouTube and mainstream star based on
   how they fared in respondents’ answers to the questions, and the
   resulting number was translated to a 100-point scale. The top five —
   and six of the top 10 — were YouTube stars.

   Drilling deeper into the survey, Sehdev found that YouTube stars scored
   significantly higher than traditional celebrities across a range of
   characteristics considered to have the highest correlation to
   influencing purchases among teens. YouTubers were judged to be more
   engaging, extraordinary and relatable than mainstream stars, who were
   rated as being smarter and more reliable. In terms of sex appeal, the
   two types of celebs finished just about even.

   Looking at survey comments and feedback, teens enjoy an intimate and
   authentic experience with YouTube celebrities, who aren’t subject to
   image strategies carefully orchestrated by PR pros. Teens also say they
   appreciate YouTube stars’ more candid sense of humor, lack of filter
   and risk-taking spirit, behaviors often curbed by Hollywood handlers.

   That should sound a warning to YouTube celebs looking to cash in on
   their fame via the traditional Tinseltown infrastructure, Sehdev notes.

   SEE ALSO: Survey: YouTube Stars More Popular Than Mainstream Celebs
   Among U.S. Teens

   “If YouTube stars are swallowed by Hollywood, they are in danger of
   becoming less authentic versions of themselves, and teenagers will be
   able to pick up on that,” Sehdev says. “That could take away the one
   thing that makes YouTube stars so appealing.”

   Better perhaps that Hollywood take a page from the YouTube playbook,
   Sehdev observes. By encouraging unvarnished individualism, studios and
   networks can help foster traditional celebs’ appeal among younger
   demographics.

   Q scores were determined to be the most reliable indicator for the
   survey’s selection of mainstream stars, whose popularity can be
   fleeting among teenage demographics. In addition, many prominent
   celebrities well known to younger consumers may not necessarily be the
   most popular among them because their prominence is driven more by
   notoriety, as opposed to true appeal.

            I’d never watched Pewdiepie, though as someone not much older
            than the demographic polled for this piece I may be expected
            to enjoy this kind of media. I watched a few of his videos
            after reading your comment and I have absolutely no idea what
            you mean by “disgusting filth” and “degenerate”. His videos
            are silly and not very sophisticated, but there is no “filth”
            in them. Also, I don’t think you understand how YouTube works.
            YT does not vet or approve videos or users who upload them. If
            viewers believe a video contravenes YT terms of use (e.g.
            pornographic content), they can report it, and YT can remove
            videos and ban the user, but clearly, no one else seems to
            have flagged Pewdiepie as “degenerate filth”.

       Want to understand more about how they do it? Listen the Radio Show
       “Sommar” with PewDiePie describing his rise to fame. It was aired
       9th of august and is about an hour long.
       http://sverigesradio.se/pewdiepie/
       Sommar i P1 is one of the biggest radio shows in Sweden and a
       staple in Swedish culture – everyone knows the well-known signature
       and the show which is on air every year during the summer, and has
       been ever since its start in 1959.
       The show is made up by interesting Swedes who get free hands to
       create their own hour and a half-long show; they get to choose
       their own music and what they want to talk about. Being a host on
       Sommar i P1 has been compared to receiving a knighthood in Sweden.
       Due to his popularity he published his program also in English

       It’s heartening to know that the 4th most popular “celebrity” on
       this list (KSI) is someone who was banned from the UK’s biggest
       gaming expo for his behaviour towards women and is well known for
       participating in a meme called “rape face”.

       Is this really any different than Disney Channel, Nickelodeon, and
       MTV stars being more popular with teens/pre-teens than actual
       celebrities? I have never heard of a single one of the people in
       red and I use YouTube every single day. I am an adult so I just
       naturally filter out all the little childrens garbage. When these
       teens grow up their tastes will mature and they will filter out
       this crap too.

       I think of Laina (OAG) who was highly regarded as an overnight
       Youtube success, who then took a LOT of flak the moment she started
       shilling for KIA and other stores… kids don’t like products, they
       like people. If the industry wants to keep making money off these
       people, they are going to have to find a stealthier “back door”
       approach.

            Actually kids don’t “think” they like products yet they are
            the biggest consumers of the newest, biggest, fastest,
            whatever that is put in front of them via non-traditional
            marketing. Most of the people on this list will fade just
            about as quickly as they have risen to be replaced by the
            newest, biggest, fastest, whatever.

       Beyoncé would be on there at least. or a long list of other

            Beyonce wasn’t an available choice. The participants were only
            given this list of 20 celebrities from which to choose. The
            limited options do make these results questionable though.
            Would’ve been more interesting to have, say, 100 choices and
            just ask the participants to rank their top 10.

       The survey was conducted among children aged 13 to 18. My guess is
       if a survey was done on the 18-to-25 age group and college kids, it
       would produce similar results. My children are younger than 13 and
       the samples in the survey. My children and their friends actually
       spend more time watching YouTube than TV, cable and movies –
       combined. So I know YouTube personalities – affectionately called
       “YouTubers” – have even stronger influences among the below-13 age
       group. So I know this trend will only continue to grow in the near
       future.
       I see from other comments that many adults of my generation are
       offended by the idea that YouTubers are more popular than the
       “real” celebrities with whom they are familiar. The comments accuse
       the YouTube generation of being “stupid”. I disagree. YouTubers are
       certainly smarter and better than the likes of Kim Kardashian and
       Paris Hilton.
       Paul Walker is the mainstream celebrity who has the highest survey
       score. I suspect the reason is he was recently in the news and
       mentioned by many YouTubers. I know because that was how I found
       out about Paul Walker was killed in a fiery car accident. I had no
       idea who he was before I repeatedly heard about him on YouTube.

            As a part of the 18-25 demographic, the only “youtubers” I
            know are Smosh, PewDiePie, Tyler Oakley, and the Harries
            brother. I only know of these people from my cousins who are
            6-10 years younger than me.
            I watch a lot of youtube, but definitely do not consume more
            youtube than TV or Film. In fact, I don’t know many people my
            age who watch more youtubers than TV. Yes, there are a few who
            consume more “Youtubers”, but I’d say that among the 18-25
            demographic, there’s still more of a traditional celebrity fan
            culture than a youtube-celeb fan one.

                 Kim Kardashian and Paris Hilton actually do not have much
                 of a presence on YouTube. I watch a lot of YouTube and
                 very little television. (The only shows I watch on TV are
                 Game of Thrones once a year, The Legend of Korra that has
                 recently become an online-only show, and very few
                 occasions CNN and MSNBC; Hm. Maybe it’s time for me to
                 cut my cable.) I know Kardashian and Hilton are reality
                 TV “stars” who have done nothing worthwhile to deserve
                 their success and wealth. I know they became famous
                 because their sex tapes were “leaked”, and then their
                 publicists leveraged their ill-gotten fame to gain
                 success and money. When YouTubers talk about them, it is
                 almost always to take jabs at their decadence or to use
                 them as examples as to why we need to tax the spoiled
                 rich more.

       Today’s young people are stupid. No doubt in my mind. But, you
       can’t blame them for it. Because just about every parent shoves
       cell phone, tablet/iPads, any kind of computer in the child faces
       so they don’t have to deal with them. In turn, these kids watch the
       dumbest crap out there. These kids can’t tell you what their

       That is true. Like I tell my mom these people on TV are a big lie.
       And Youtubers do more like giving charity to kids that need it.
       When have you seen a Hollywood star give charity? I haven’t seen
       one.

       YouTube superstar stories are B.S. Many of these “Internet
       celebrities” are manufactured by the same old studio system from
       behind the curtain.
       Research shows young consumers don’t want to feel manipulated to
       buy by big corporations, so you camouflage the corporate
       involvement by making the product/star appear a “grass roots
       success story.” The new Brittney Spears is filmed in a set that
       looks like a suburban bedroom in Peoria, talking about her
       boyfriend and her taste in sweaters. Now, put it on YouTube,
       boosting the rankings with Vietnamese click farm views so it
       appears already popular, and plebeians will join in to see what’s
       the hubbub.
       Next, write the story, “17-year-old girl makes six figures talking
       about her cat’s farts on YouTube!” Include quotes from major
       entertainment execs saying, “This little lady has us by the short
       and curlies!” Great story!
       Now launch the mainstream TV show/movie with the “viral sensation.”
       The audience feels bought into the success of the project because
       they helped “elect” the celebrity with YouTube clicks. A million
       Davids have beaten the Goliath from the iPhone their mom bought
       them – or so they feel.
       After reading about the gold rush, the proletarians go spend their
       lawn mowing money on cameras and mics trying to replicate the
       success, but wonder why it’s taking them six months to accumulate
       12 views. (Hint: Because they’re the REAL “viral stars.”) There are
       people with decades-long performing resumes and even Emmys that
       struggle to get a thousand views with personal YouTube projects,
       and you’re telling me some unknown teen has 12 million? Yeah,
       right!
          + avmanm says:
            August 31, 2014 at 1:32 am
            Actors with decades of experience and Emmy winners are
            precisely the kind of “celebrity” younger viewers tend to
            avoid, so I don’t see why you are surprised they can’t get
            views. Other than that, don’t spout nonsense about something
            you are ignorant about. There are no “big studios” behind most
            successful Youtubers, and most of them do not aspire to a
            career in mainstream media. I follow a handful of Youtube
            performers who are unknown in mainstream entertainment and
            have no intention of making the jump. I watch them because
            they are talented and entertaining, not because a “Vietnamese
            click farm” drove up their views and young people will watch
            anything that seems “popular”.
            Also, not everyone is talented, so don’t be surprised all your
            lawn mowing friends’ Youtube channels didn’t work out. For
            every one successful Youtubers, there are thousands who don’t
            achieve popularity. This is not because they are drowned out
            by corporation-backed celebrities, but because they are not
            talented enough. The same thing happens in the “real world”,
            so I am not sure why you are surprised that many aspiring
            Youtube performers cannot replicate the success of others.

            I would really like to know who are these ‘youtube’ stars you
            seem to think are manufactured by studios and big
            corporations. Most of these Youtubers started off small and
            then became big corporations themselves. But they are still
            the ones pulling the strings and putting out content. There is
            no mysterious suit&tie behind them, the ones pulling the
            strings and taking in the income and the ones you see on
            camera. The End.

            Everyone wants to believe they, too, can plug in a $30 webcam
            and become a multi-millionaire movie star, thus they’re
            resistant to my message. But I can point you to a two-time
            Emmy winner who is frustrated her YouTube videos only draw
            about 1,200 views. Or two guys who were instructors at the UCB
            Theater in New York for 20 years, who make videos 10x funnier
            than anything you’ll see on Saturday Night Live, and they only
            get about 350 views. Or a musician who’s played Carnegie Hall
            and huge European festivals who’s YouTubes only get about 200
            views apiece. Former large market radio DJ’s who’s podcasts
            get 300 downloads on a good day. But a teenybopper in Grand
            Rapids has outsmarted them all? Sorry, but large corporations
            setting up fake “indie labels,” and now TV companies setting
            up YouTube channels and manufacturing “homegrown” stars, is
            real.

                 I’ve watched UCB’s videos on Youtube (though maybe not
                 the people you are referring to), they are not that funny
                 and just come across as forced and melodramatic. Playing
                 Carnegie Hall is a great achievement for a musician in
                 certain circles, but most younger people do not
                 necessarily like that type of music. Winning an Emmy is
                 not a guarantee of future success; think of how most of
                 the Seinfeld cast never achieved the same level of
                 success afterwards. At any rate, unless your Emmy winner
                 still has a successful screen career, she is quite likely
                 a washed-up former star who no one has followed in some
                 time, so there is no surprise her YT doesn’t do well.
                 I don’t think you understand something very fundamental.
                 Your age-old definitions of “successful artists” simply
                 does not hold in the online world. You cannot expect Emmy
                 winners or Carnegie Hall players to do well on YT because
                 the viewing demographic just doesn’t care about those
                 achievements. This is not because people are watching TV
                 company backed “fake homegrown stars”, but because people
                 find independent YT performers more
                 relatable/”genuine”/entertaining. The reason your
                 “successful artists” are unsuccessful online is precisely
                 that their success offline has nothing to do with success
                 online.
                 Lastly, I can think of several well-known TV
                 personalities who have successful YT series; the British
                 comedian David Mitchell being one I enjoy (watch “David
                 Mitchell’s Soapbox on Youtube).

            You really don’t get it do you? The only thing that’s bs is
            your cynical perspective in thinking that everything is
            powered by big corporations. Obviously you don’t understand
            that almost every youtube star has built up their success
            gradually and over time the quality of their videos improves.
            Pewdiepie and KSI both started off with pretty hilariously
            awful videos, but then improved them over the course of 3-4
            years and started gaining subscribors. Once they reach 1-2
            million subs by making great videos and being genuine with
            their audience by having q and a’s, more mainstream kids find
            out, and the sub count skyrockets. Many popular youtubers also
            have iconic videos that everyone saw, and this led to rapid
            growth in their channel. If you understood anything about
            youtube stars you wouldn’t have just made that comment.

            The people who get so many millions of views, get them because
            they’re way more entertaining and likeable than those who are
            getting maybe 10 views in days (like me).

       So YouTube reveals that audiences do prefer true over manufactured
       authenticity. But will that make celebrity branding more honest? Or
       even more cunningly deceiving? Wonder what celebrity branding

            Youtube is not always “Authentic” there is a LOT of fakeness
            in online content as there is in more “Traditional” contect
            (I.e. movies, tv). But i do understand your point and there is

       Youtubers are someone people choose to watch by themselves, yet

       I believe Pewdiepie is the most popular figure among teenagers. his
       videos always rank #1 on youtube trends map and his channel gets
       more views than any other youtuber and mainstream celeb including
       shakira, rihanna, pitbull, etc. Currently his channel has the
       biggest amount of views: 5,465,112,448, over 200m more than Rihanna
       5,250,539,864 and he gets over 250-300m every month.

            The reason, I think, that PewDiePie isn’t #1, is because this
            survey only involved US teens. Many of Felix’s fans are
            Europeans, mostly Scandinavians, and Asian.

       I’ve been making fun of Smosh forever, and now they are the #1
       celebrity in America. However, the conclusions of this survey do
       sound correct to me — the snippets I hear directly from teens and
       pre-teens are filled with far more mentions of things like
       pewdewpie and jenna marbles than Leonardo DiCaprio, who probably
       would rather have been #21 just so he wasn’t mentioned on this
       list.
