   Hello, and welcome to another Other Machine Co project tutorial! I'm
   Sam DeRose, OMC's summer intern.

   Engraving text is one of the most versatile and fun uses of the
   Othermill. If you can fit it onto the bed of the mill, you can write
   stuff on it! The possibilities are endless.

   This Instructable will show you the basics of engraving, and open the
   doors to a world of writing messages on anything and everything.

   Included in this post:
     * How to engrave and cut out FR-1 circuit boards using Eagle
     * How to do the same with solid copper sheets
     * A library of letter and number files created specifically for
       engraving copper (G-code)
     * A "Key Tag" template (G-code) for cutting 0.035" copper sheets
       ("outline.tap")

   There are two techniques explained here: one uses Eagle and an FR-1
   circuit board, the other uses Otherplan, the attached library of letter
   files, and a 0.035" thick copper, brass, or aluminum sheet.

   Use the Eagle method if you not only want to engrave, but also want to
   cut out a custom shape around your text. If you're okay with a simple
   key-dongle shape, but want it to be made from metal and have better
   looking text, then use the other method that uses the G-Code letter
   files.

   If you aren't yet familiar with the Othermill, take a couple minutes
   and look through this Instructable to get started on the mill.

Step 1: Gather Tools & Materials

   Method 1: The Eagle method requires these tools and materials:

   Tools
     * An Othermill
     * A computer with Otherplan installed
     * A 1/32" flat endmill
     * A 1/64" flat endmill (optional, for finer detail)

   Materials
     * An FR-1 PCB blank (double or single sided)
     * Double-sided tape

   Method 2: The copper / brass method requires these supplies:

   Tools
     * An Othermill
     * A computer with Otherplan installed
     * An engraving bit (80-degree tapper with a 0.005" tip)
     * A 1/32" flat endmill

   Materials
     * Copper, brass, or aluminum sheet for cutting (0.035 inches thick)
     * Double-sided tape

   Files download from this page, or the intro step
     * The library of G-Code files for each letter and number
       ("GCODE_Letters.zip")
     * The G-Code file for the outline of the key dongle ("outline.tap")

   Gather your supplies and continue to the next step!
