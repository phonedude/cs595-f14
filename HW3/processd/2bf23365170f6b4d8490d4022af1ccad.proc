The Benioff Doctrine

   Marc Benioff has a message for his rich tech friends: Give back or get
   out. A candid conversation with the Salesforce CEO and philanthropic
   alpha dog.
   Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff.

   The people's mogul: Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff.

   On February 12, Daniel Lurie was anxiously awaiting the birth of his
   second child when he received an unexpected phone call. Suzanne
   DiBianca, the executive director of the Salesforce Foundation, was
   ringing to find out if Lurie, the CEO of philanthropy Tipping Point
   Community, had spoken to her boss, Marc Benioff, yet. “I said, ‘Haven’t
   heard from him,’” Lurie recounts, “and she said, ‘Well, Marc has this
   idea called SF Gives. We’ll get 20 companies on board, have them donate
   $500,000 each, and all $10 million goes to Tipping Point.’” Lurie’s
   response? “I said, ‘I like that idea.’”

   More likely, Lurie was doing backflips off his standing desk. His
   nine-year-old charitable organization, which has disbursed $60 million
   to poverty-focused nonprofits in the Bay Area, had just been tapped as
   the cause du jour of the biggest, loudest philanthropist in San
   Francisco: a man who with his wife, Lynne, just announced a second $100
   million donation to UCSF; a guy who told Mayor Ed Lee to “think bigger”
   when Lee lowballed his ask for the city’s middle schools; a mogul who
   has publicly chastised his fellow tech titans for their stinginess;
   whose company just landed the naming rights to the tallest building
   west of Chicago, to be known as the Salesforce Tower—that Benioff. And
   the bear-size CEO, founder of the $33 billion cloud computing company,
   was not only offering to fundraise for Lurie’s charity; he was also
   proposing a strategy that would tacitly pressure dozens of other local
   tech firms to follow suit. (Lurie added to the sense of urgency by
   imposing a 60-day donation deadline, ending May 7.) The initiative was
   framed as a challenge, if not a threat: Join the cause or face the
   consequences.

   Ingeniously, Benioff—whose company employs 4,000 workers in San
   Francisco, more than any other tech firm—was timing the SF Gives
   campaign to a moment when his industry’s public approval ratings were
   bottoming out. For a solid two years, tech companies had been
   browbeaten and shamed, their buses blockaded, their headquarters
   picketed, their goodwill depleted by turkeys like Peter Shih, Greg
   Gopman, and Tom Perkins. Now the Salesforce boss—who is hailed in
   corporate and philanthropic circles for inventing the widely replicated
   1/1/1 system, which mandates donating 1 percent of stock, 1 percent of
   products, and 1 percent of employee hours to charity—was handing his
   tech brethren another readymade tool for giving back.

   Not to mention, a very savvy counter-narrative. SF Gives would not only
   be a boon to Tipping Point—amassing in two months more than 75 percent
   of what the philanthropy raised in all of 2013—and a cudgel for
   fighting poverty and inequality in the Bay Area; it would also be a
   symbol of tech’s renewed commitment to its adopted home. What company
   could say no to that?

   A week after DiBianca’s call, and just two days after his son was born,
   Lurie hit the phones. Using his golden Rolodex (he’s the stepson of
   ex–Levi’s head Peter Haas and chairs the city’s Super Bowl host
   committee) and Benioff ’s platinum one, he was able to quickly sign up
   12 corporations—including major names like Google, Levi’s, LinkedIn,
   Zynga, Box, Jawbone, PopSugar, Dropbox, and, of course, Salesforce. But
   despite the heartening number of assents, he received a fair share of
   polite refusals.

   For Lurie, some of them are understandable: “There have been a couple
   of companies that said, at this stage, $500,000 is a lot,” he explains.
   “They haven’t turned a profit, and they have to protect their
   shareholders. Some of these are really young companies that we’ve
   approached. I get that.”

   But other leaders had something else stopping them, something that
   Lurie is hesitant to discuss, but that Benioff explored at length
   during a recent conversation in his executive suite at Salesforce
   headquarters. That something, he told San Francisco editor-in-chief Jon
   Steinberg, is ideology. A pervasive and pernicious culture of
   selfishness, he asserts, still hovers over his industry. And he has
   made it one of his life’s many missions to expunge it.

   Let’s talk about the genesis of SF Gives: Did it come to you in a
   dream, or was it something you studied and beta tested?
   I just felt it. It started in December, when I got a call from Chris
   O’Brien and Jessica Guynn, two reporters at the L.A. Times. They were
   working on this story about unrest in S.F.—the buses in our
   neighborhoods, the Ellis Act, people getting thrown out of their homes,
   broad gentrification across the city—all because of the tech boom. I
   talked to them on the phone for quite a long time, and they did a
   really good job of researching and writing their story, which then
   inspired a lot of other stories: USA Today wrote about it, the Wall
   Street Journal wrote about it, Bloomberg picked it up, and on and on.
   More and more, there was this conversation bubbling up nationally, with
   people asking, what’s going on with tech in this city?

   Was this conversation giving you a sense of frustration or
   embarrassment about how your industry was being represented?
   No. My opinion is that S.F. has a history of innovation and change. New
   industries and movements come out of S.F. on a regular basis. Everybody
   knows about the Gold Rush, the Summer of Love, gay rights—but it’s also
   where Bank of America was headquartered, Wells Fargo, Levi Strauss.
   It’s a city of innovation, of flamboyance, of transformation, and
   during boom times, S.F. always changes and evolves. But tied into that
   has always been generosity: the Haas family, the Hellmans, the Fishers,
   the Shorensteins. During every one of these boom times, the people who
   benefited the most were also giving back the most. But this time
   around, we haven’t been able to talk about a broad philanthropic effort
   to couple with the growth. So this seemed like a great opportunity.

   I find it interesting that this campaign you’ve come up with isn’t just
   about philanthropy. It’s also a really bold stunt. You’re basically
   calling out tech CEOs to put up or shut up.
   Well, for 15 years, my company has been doing 1/1/1. It has been a
   great program, and many other companies have followed us. But not
   everyone wants to adopt 1/1/1. CEOs look at it like a religion: You
   either believe in it or you don’t. I wanted to make it a little bit
   easier for CEOs to say yes. The first person I called was Ron Conway. I
   said, “Ron, what we’re going to do is get companies to give $500,000,
   and I’m going to raise $10 million, and we are going to give back to
   S.F. en masse with money from organizations, not just individuals.” He
   said, “This is never gonna work. I run sf.citi [a political advocacy
   group for 500 local tech companies], and people won’t even pay their
   dues. You’re not going to raise millions of dollars.” I was actually
   standing by Rincon Center on the street corner with cars rushing by in
   front of me, and I said, “Ron, this is definitely going to happen, I
   can feel this coming through me.”

   So why is it that Ron Conway can’t collect nominal dues from his
   members, but Marc Benioff can collect tens of millions of dollars from
   the same folks?
   Because this is not about any political agenda. It’s not. It’s about
   pure-play philanthropy: giving back to nonprofits and NGOs that can
   make a difference in S.F. That’s why. Tech leaders want to give, but
   they need a good vehicle, and they need to trust that it’ll be done
   with quality and integrity. That’s what Daniel Lurie and Tipping Point
   offer.

   And you were confident of its success because...
   I spend a lot of time with these other CEOs—we do dinners, lunches.
   They’re all very generous individually, and they want to do more, but
   they need vehicles. I think that they could be more generous
   collectively, and that was the premise. So far it’s playing out: We’re
   well on our way to our first $10 million of commitments. Daniel Lurie
   is surprised.

   Yeah, I'll bet he’s giddy.
   I’ll tell you why: We make three calls, we’re getting two yeses and one
   no. So we just keep calling. There are 2,000 tech companies within two
   miles of this building [1 Market Street on the Embarcadero]. We have a
   lot of calls and emails still to make. It’s been super easy to do. We
   have maybe sent a total of 25 emails, and we’ve gotten 14 yeses.

   That brings us to the most obvious question: Why would any tech leader
   say no to this?
   You get CEOs who don’t believe that organizations or individuals should
   give back. There’s a very famous CEO—I won’t give you his name—who told
   me, “Our office is not in S.F., our factory is not in S.F., and we’re
   not going to do this.” I said, “Don’t you think you should give back
   anyway?” And he said, “What have we been given?”

   Hmm.
   Yeah, so I said, “Can I use this quote in my press release?” He said,
   “No, I don’t want the media attention.” I told him I respect that.

   But do you really respect that? it seems like you don’t.
   I respect everybody’s ability to have their own view, and in my view,
   the people who are happiest are the people who do things for others. If
   you choose not to do something for others, that’s fine, but ultimately,
   just having success or being an innovator is not enough. I have a lot
   of friends who are innovators who are not happy, and they’re not happy
   because they don’t give. The ones who give are the happiest.

   I don’t know—it seems like there are a lot of stingy, happy CEOs out
   there.
   When I was at Oracle, I’d have this debate all the time with Larry
   Ellison, who has been a huge influence on my career. He’d always say,
   “Who do you think has done more for the world: the Ford Foundation or
   the Ford corporation?” Larry is very much my teacher of Zen in many
   ways, and that is kind of a Zen koan. It took me a few years until I
   came back to him and said, “I’ll tell you the answer to that question.
   Both. You can add value by having great employees and building great
   products, but you can also add value though philanthropy.” “Both” is
   the answer. There’s not a choice to be made. This is too easy.
