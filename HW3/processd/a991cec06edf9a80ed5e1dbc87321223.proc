Three of the largest tech acquisitions in 2014 are hardware companies
       319462_10150807895075313_1360808361_n By James Robinson
       On June 2, 2014
       doozer Nest, $3.2 billion. Oculus Rift, $2 billion. Beats, $3
       billion.
       Three of the four largest tech acquisitions in 2014 have been
       hardware deals. This is massive, iron clad backing to the
       prevailing “hardware is sexy” narrative. The success stories go
       past these three, too. GoPro — who sold of 8.8 percent of their
       company in 2012 at a $2.25 billion evaluation — have pulled back
       the financial curtain for a coming IPO, to universal praise. A
       Jawbone IPO is rumored, potentially also putting it in the billion
       dollar club.
       Hardware isn’t just cool anymore, it is lucrative. It is an
       entirely new investment dynamic. Trolling through years of
       investment data on venture backed exits in tech, it all tells the
       same story… until now. Hardware deals have been fewer and further
       between and relatively minor in size with Internet and software
       acquisitions making up most of the action and most of the value.
       Google bought eight robotics companies last year but likely paid
       less than $100 million.
       In the first quarter of 2014, Nest’s sale to Google for $3.2
       billion was only one out of 79 acquisitions, but accounted for 43
       percent of the combined disclosed value of all deals. (Granted,
       Facebook’s WhatsApp and Oculus Rift buys were officially cleared in
       April, so don’t technically count to that number.)
       We’ve seen an avalanche of bluster, speculation and op-eds out of
       this action. But inside the bigger hype, we’re really only looking
       at a handful of big stories.
       Meaningfully then, how does the landscape change from here?
       The logical assumption from this flurry of activity is that it will
       change attitudes about the possibilities of hardware and in turn
       lead to more investment. The argument goes that with Oculus Rift’s
       rapid transformation from $2 million Kickstarter campaign to $2
       billion acquisition, in the backs of their minds opportunistic
       investors will look twice at more obscure hardware companies. Which
       will help. Talk to any hardware entrepreneur, no matter how
       promising or inevitable their product and they can run off a
       highlight reel of rejection from venture capitalists reluctant to
       do hardware deals, usually burned in the past by one that went
       badly wrong. Even in the midst of the current hardware boom you
       could still comfortably count the number of VCs doing major
       hardware deals on one hand. If it wasn’t for this dynamic,
       crowdfunding might not have got as big as it has. All of the top
       three, and five of the top ten, largest Kickstarter campaigns are
       hardware related.
       Following the Oculus deal late in March, this progression has
       rolled as if on cue. In mid-May Survios — which makes full body
       motion detection technology for VR platforms — officially closed
       its $4 million Series A, led by Shasta Ventures. Immersive
       360-video makers Jaunt closed a $6.8 million round days after the
       Oculus deal was announced and VR startup Virtuix netted $3 million
       later in April.
       But it is worth pointing out, that what made Nest, Beats and Oculus
       most tempting was that they were all software companies, with a
       hardware hat on them, as many VCs like to say. And the companies
       doing the acquiring — Apple, Facebook, Google — were all
       technological monoliths who bought them as much, or more, for the
       platforms they represented than the technological innovation they
       brought in with them. In an SEC filing uncovered in March, Google
       talked about one day delivering advertisements to cars and
       refrigerators (one could assume, also that this applies to
       thermostats). When Facebook announced the Oculus-deal, Mark
       Zuckerberg talked about it as the post-mobile platform of the
       future and in most analyst’s eyes, Beats’ new music streaming
       services were infinitely more attractive to Apple than its ritzy
       headphones.
       Toys for toys sake hasn’t proven to hold great value. GoPro has its
       media tie ins. Jawbone lags behind FitBit in market share, but has
       made extensive investments in data science and lately has partnered
       with every company under the sun to expand its footprint.
       Maybe the most important factor — and the most impossible to
       forecast — in divining what impact this 2014 spending spree has
       years from now, is how the landscape of innovation is impacted with
       all of this IP hoovered up inside huge companies.
       Investment and speculation in virtual reality has continued even
       after Facebook bought Oculus, but we can’t know how Oculus’
       eventual endgame is changed by having Facebook as it’s owner.
       Nest’s sale made a splash as a possible Internet of Things
       inflection point, but it has set the company outside of the swarm
       of innovation that has happened in the space in the months since.
       Google absorbed eight robotics companies in 2013. You only need to
       look at the slow pace of non-Google innovation around self-driving
       cars to see what can happen when entrepreneurs assume that one
       company has too much of an advantage.
       Forecasting long term, the spike in VR-investment post Oculus’ sale
       suggests that a bigger corresponding spike is probably coming. But
       this isn’t purely a win for hardware. It’s a win for hardware that
       opens up new platforms and new opportunities for data. And as more
       of this hardware gets moved inside the tall walls of Silicon
       Valley’s largest companies, we should always temper our celebration
       with just a dose of suspicion.
