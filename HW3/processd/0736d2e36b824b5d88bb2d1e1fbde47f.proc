   Sounds to me like he simply tried to fight for his own profits against
   the nationalization of telephony.﻿

   /agree Jurgen, possibly even the government could look like it was
   fighting for net neutrality, though I am sure they were thinking of
   profit too.
     It is kind of ironic in light of Jeff's other share about the
   telephone being used to pack in 45 extra minutes of Parliament before
   the Daily Times was printed up﻿

   And now we (in the UK) have a single phone network which can be used by
   any Internet provider. When I want broadband I can choose from 100s of
   suppliers for my home. An unlimited fibre connection costs around £10
   ($18) per month.
   We have competition. How's your internet competition working out in the
   US? you guys must have 1000s of options?﻿

   Government, creating monopolies, stifling innovation, and choosing
   winners, for centuries.
   Tell me again why we need government?﻿

   Goverent, making sure that essential utilities reach everyone, not just
   those people who happen to live in high density areas where companies
   can make big profits. ﻿

   The telephone system was and still is to some extent, seen as a
   strategic military asset and so kept as a government department until
   1984. The government can still take control of it in times of
   emergency﻿
