   Kids Day at OSCON 2014

   This year at OSCON we’re partnering with Devoxx4Kids to host an entire
   day of workshops for school aged children interested in learning more
   about computer programming. Workshops will include Java, Python,
   Scratch, Minecraft Modding, Arduino, and more. Recommended ages for the
   workshops are 6 and up, depending on your child’s skills and abilities.

   Laptops will be provided for the kids to work on. The $20 ticket price
   includes all workshops, a t-shirt, lunch for both the child and their
   parent/guardian, and snacks throughout the day.

   Note: a parent or guardian must accompany their child to OSCON Kids Day
   and stay for the duration. We’ll have wifi available so bring your
   favorite device with you. Parents are encouraged to participate by
   sitting alongside their child as they work.

   NOTE: We’ve reached capacity and Kids Day is now sold out. We look
   forward to welcoming 70 kids and their parents at OSCON this year!

   Python
   Instructor: Aimee Maree
   This workshop is a light introduction to the Python language and to
   programming in general. We will aim to teach the basics of programming
   through both discussion and hands on programming tasks that they will
   run on a computer. By getting the kids to create some basic games they
   will learn by hands on examples the basic concepts of how accept data
   into a program (inputs), how to display it back (outputs) and some
   logic required to create a couple of small games. Laptops with the
   Python environment will be provided. Kids are encouraged to bring a USB
   key to take a copy of the code they created. Information will be
   provided for those who are interested in further training resources
   on-line.

   Raspberry Pi Gaming 4 Kids
   Instructor: Stephen Chin
   The Raspberry Pi is a credit-card sized computer designed specifically
   for teaching programming in schools. We will be using it in this
   session to explore basic programming concepts in the context of a
   simple computer game. Students will get a chance to assemble a mini
   computer from scratch, learn to use the command line to compile and
   execute programs, and to make small enhancements to an existing
   program. Raspberry Pi hardware will be supplied for use during the lab;
   however, you are encouraged to bring your own device that you can use
   at home after the lab to continue exploring and learning.

   Scratch
   Instructor: Howard Abrams
   Come join us as we learn the basics of one of the world’s favorite
   programming environment for students, Scratch. We begin by showing off
   the Scratch Sharing Community web site where we’ll see what other
   students have done, and then “look inside” the projects to see how they
   tick. In this class, the kids will learn Scratch fundamentals like
   sprite animation and “message passing” to create some really cool
   games. Best of all, you can share your creations with friends.

   Dare to Make and Share
   Instructor: Emma Irwin
   The Mozilla Webmaker community believes in the web as a platform for
   learning, sharing, connecting and making, and we believe that open
   practice and participation are key elements to becoming a citizen in
   the digital world. Contribution to open projects begins with the
   understanding of that ‘open’ is an invitation to collaborate, to remix
   and innovate. At this workshop kids will have an opportunity to create
   fun web animations as a contribution to the OSCON Kids Paracommunity
   Wall, we’ll also leverage Together.js built into Mozilla Thimble to
   collaboratively build a website for our session. We’ll cover the
   building blocks of the web learning HTML and CSS, while taking a deep
   dive into open practices with a wrap-up discussion about why this way
   of working is not only fun, but can change the world. Participants must
   be able to read, and should have experienced ‘using’ the web on some
   level (Googling, playing games, doing homework, social media).

   Internet of Things using Arduino
   Instructor: Pradeep Bhatter

   Computers connect to other computers of networks. People connect to
   other people over social networks. “Things” or objects from everyday
   life, like water heater, energy meter, and weather station are now
   connecting to each other and people, computers and the Internet.
   “Things” sense and change the world around them. In the workshop, we
   will cover the basic concepts applied for interfacing the real world to
   the digital world like – like sensors and controllers, circuits,
   voltage, current, analog and digital. Kids will learn these while
   performing hands-on activities using Arduino Uno compatible
   microcontroller, switches, LEDs, light sensor, breadboard etc. Arduino
   is an open-source microcontroller. The attendees learn to write and run
   “Sketches” for Arduino. Activities will also include building
   interaction between Computer and “Things” first directly and then over
   the network using Scratch for Arduino.

   Minecraft Modding
   Instructors: Aditya & Arun Gupta

   Minecraft is a multi-player game about building and placing blocks in a
   three-dimensional environment. The game was originally built in Java
   but has been ported to Android, iOS, and XBox 360. The game allows
   modifications (known as “mods”) that can change the game from what it
   was originally written. These mods can add content to the game to alter
   gameplay. For example, new blocks, mobs, and abilities of player can be
   added. Have you always wondered what it takes to write these mods? This
   workshop is for you! This workshop will teach the attendees how to
   build Minecraft mods.

   @Dan – we will provide the laptops with all the necessary installations
   for all the workshops. We do recommend bringing a USB memory stick
   though in case your child wants to save any of his/her work.

   Should we bring a laptop for the Scratch and Minecraft sessions (the
   Python session says laptop provided). Any pre-work or software
   installations needed?

   Can you provide any guidance/expectations WRT age-range and/or
   skill-level of the students signed up for this?
