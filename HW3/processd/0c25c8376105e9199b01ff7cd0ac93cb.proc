New US Digital Service Looks to Avoid IT Catastrophes

   Bernal)

   At a time when the public's trust in institutions is at historic lows,
   the federal government's use of technology has an unusual place in the
   national discourse. After the first Internet president's administration
   was responsible for the high-profile failure of Healthcare.gov, the
   issue seemed ripe to drive significant reform on Capitol Hill. Even if
   some 10 million adults gained health insurance through the Affordable
   Care Act after "Obama's trauma team" made successful fixes to
   Healthcare.gov, negative public perception has lingered, and for good
   reason. Under the radar, other projects have continued to sputter, like
   a $300 million dollar Social Security government IT boondoggle that
   still has not delivered a working system for submitting disability
   claims. The crash of the FCC's dated website under the weight of 1.1
   million comments this summer didn't help, either. At the same time, the
   confidence of the technology community has been damaged by revelations
   of dragnet surveillance and surreptitious backdoors planted in
   software.

   In the face of those challenges, both the legislative branch and
   executive branch of the U.S. government have taken steps to address the
   endemic failures of large IT projects and systemic issues with the way
   Uncle Sam plans, creates and maintains technology. In July, a
   bipartisan group of lawmakers formally introduced the Reforming Federal
   Procurement of Information Technology Act (RFP-IT), which would codify
   the successful Presidential Innovation Fellows program, establish a
   Digital Government Office and expand competition for federal IT
   contracting. Earlier in the year, the U.S. House of Representatives
   passed H.R. 1232, the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform
   Act (FITARA), which could give federal chief information officer more
   authority, but it hasn't gone anywhere in the Senate, like so many
   other bills in the least productive Congress in the modern era. Both
   RFP-IT and FITARA might be earn consideration in the lame duck session
   of the 113th Congress, however, after the November mid-term elections.

   On the executive side, the White House and federal agencies have made
   several significant moves over the winter and spring, even as the furor
   over the Healthcare.gov mess grew and subsided. The first big public
   initiative was the establishment of 18F, a new unit of the U.S. General
   Services Agency that looks to "fail fast" instead of failing big on
   government IT projects. Working with agencies, fellows and contractors,
   18F is actually building, free and open source government digital
   services, working in public on Github , for the public. Significantly,
   18F has committed to developing free and open source software for Uncle
   Sam, releasing code developed on behalf of the public to the public. As
   I wrote here in April, if 18F can prove that bringing technologists
   into government to buy, build and deploy technology, it will be a huge
   shift from the traditional RFP and contracting model, offering a new
   model for "insourcing" technology and creating new pressure in the
   market for services.

   The second initiative went live on Monday, when the White House
   formally launched a United States Digital Service (USDS) and published
   an open source Digital Services Playbook and a “TechFAR,” a part of the
   guide that “highlights the flexibilities in the Federal Acquisition
   Regulation (FAR) that can help agencies implement ‘plays’ from the
   Digital Services Playbook.”

   While the playbook has earned a lot of attention, the TechFAR component
   of it may have more impact inside of government. If you read between
   the lines the way Red Hat chief public sector strategist Gunnar
   Hellekson does, " The existence of TechFAR implicitly endorses what
   industry has been saying for quite some time: the rules are fine as
   they are," he wrote on his blog. "This is a surprise, since you can’t
   spend five minutes with someone in government IT without a sarcastic
   remark about procurement. With TechFAR, OMB has spoken: We can make do
   with the acquisition tools we have. Reinterpretation and new guidance
   will get us where we need to go."

   That's not to say that no regulatory reform is needed nor that
   legislative action would make no difference. It does mean that the
   White House felt that clarity around the flexibility that federal
   procurement officers already enjoy needed to re-emphasized.

   "The staggering failure rate of government technology projects can
   attributed to a number of factors, but none are as pervasive as
   outdated development practices that put all the planning up front and
   fail to understand the system's actual users," said Jen Pahlka, the
   founder of Code for America, in an interview. Pahlka worked on this
   problem while she was at the White House for the last year, serving as
   a deputy U.S. chief technology officer. "The TechFAR handbook finally
   makes it clear to the contracting community and the federal IT
   community that agile development is not only perfectly legal, but in
   fact the default methodology. This is huge: it gives those responsible
   for creating government digital services access to the same development
   methods that have produced the world-changing consumer services so many
   use today."

   The digital playbook itself is something of a marvel for an official
   government policy: it's elegantly designed, has clear navigation and is
   responsive to any device you choose to view it upon. It's certainly
   strongly evocative of the award-winning design principles promulgated
   by the United Kingdom's Government Digital Service (DGS) last year, a
   parallel that can and should lead to comparisons to the British
   approach to delivering digital services.

   If those GDS principles have inspired those of the USDS, "I feel
   vindicated," said Mike Bracken, the executive director of digital for
   the United Kingdom, in an interview. "The principles by which we work
   are nothing more than applied common sense in the Internet age. If they
   make sense, use them: they're for everybody."

   Whether the USDS and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) can
   create carrots and sticks for agencies to adopt those principles is
   another matter. Unlike the United Kingdom's Digital Government Service,
   the United States has not created a singular new entity with a large
   budget and spending authority. Nor has it hired dozens and dozens of
   top technologists at high pay grades who then set about building core
   digital services for the country, although 18F merits comparison.
   Instead, the USDS will work with federal agencies as they create or
   upgrade services and products.

   "At the end of the day, the agencies own the delivery of their
   services," said U.S. chief information officer Steven VanRoekel, who
   will oversee the USDS in OMB, in an interview. "They crave new
   approaches. They crave having people help them really be state of the
   art and come in at a low cost and high value, high output, and high
   level of effectiveness. The engagement in the ramp-up stage, to get our
   minimally viable product team out there and work with these limited
   number of agencies, will really be on a one-on-one. They're asking for
   us more than we're asking to go into them and deploy this team on
   board. We have, right now, more demand for the service than we have
   supply. We have to be targeted for our ability to go out and work
   directly with them."

   Much in the same way that the "trauma team" drove improvements to
   Healthcare.gov, the USDS will act like a consultancy, in terms of
   analyzing and helping to manage government IT projects and products
   better.

   "I think the Digital Service will go in and work with agencies on
   identifying what level of capability does this agency have to deliver a
   great service," said VanRoekel. "What are the approaches they're using?
   What are different approaches should they be using? What sort of
   technologies and direction are they taking, from open data to open
   interfaces to utilizing open source where they can? Drive that into the
   solutions set. We're not staffing to the bandwidth where they would go
   in and then take over an effort and write the code, where they'd build
   this. The [USDS] is really about being a team of context-shifters."

   In other words, 18F, Presidential Innovation Fellows and agency
   fellows, and contractors working with those agencies will build, deploy
   and maintain technology, while the USDS will strategically engage on
   certain projects to get ahead of potential failures. How that works
   remains to be seen.

   "I salute the effort and admire the strategic direction," said Bracken.
   "The separation of those skillsets seems to me perverse, but I say that
   with a huge asterisk of what I don't know. Why you wouldn't put them
   together is beyond me."

   One component that should help is proven leadership and operational
   efficacy. The White House tapped former Google reliability engineer
   Michael "Mikey" Dickerson to be the first administrator of the USDS,
   reporting to VanRoekel as a deputy US CIO. He'll be working with 7 to
   10 new hires onto this team, according to VanRoekel.

   "We will also be surrounding this team with some detailees from
   government and my other deputy US CIO, Lisa Schlosser, who runs the
   statutory functions in our office," said VanRoekel. "We're also going
   to have great opportunities for her team to rotate in, and they come
   with a deep expertise in procurement, cybersecurity, and other things.
   We'll surround the team with some infrastructure that helps them kinda
   navigate but yet disrupt the status quo." If RFP-IT becomes law, it
   would codify the USDS within OMB, with the United States chief
   information officer at its head as a Senate-confirmed presidential
   appointee.

   By hiring key members of the team that rescued Healthcare.gov, the
   Obama administration proved it could attract top tech talent, following
   its success in attracting other technologists to the Consumer Financial
   Protection Agency, Department of Health and Human Services, and 18F,
   among others.

   "There's a right way to do digital services that work for the people
   they're supposed to serve, and Mikey Dickerson showed how to do that
   with his heroic effort on healthcare.gov," said Pahlka. "Now he's going
   to help us avoid crises like that in the future by leading the U.S.
   Digital Service. Government needs him and those like him. If we can't
   implement the policies we create, we can't govern."

   If the USDS is an effort to make the lessons learned from
   Healthcare.gov endure elsewhere in government, Dickerson will have
   plenty of opportunities to "run that playbook" again.

   "We think that a lot of the same tactics that worked on Healthcare.gov
   will work again at other agencies again and again," said Dickerson, in
   an interview. "We have high confidence that the results will be
   repeatable. If you put one person in charge of a project, that usually
   helps a lot. If you monitor in real time what you're doing, that also
   helps a lot. All the stuff in the Digital Services playbook that we
   released today, that's almost a point-by-point recipe for what worked
   for us on Healthcare.gov."

   A worthwhile hypothetical to apply to the question of impact is whether
   the USDS could have identified the ineffective contract planning and
   oversight practices at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,
   the entity responsible for building Healthcare.gov, and then made an
   impact upon the choices and project management there. One of the top
   consulting firms in the world, McKinsey and Associates, warned the
   administration last spring about critical issues with Healthcare.gov in
   a "red team" report, without apparent significant impact. The CTO and
   CIO at the Department of Health and Human Services warned then
   Secretary Kathleen Sebelius about concerns, and yet the flawed
   marketplace still went live. For the USDS to make a difference, the
   White House tech team will need to be much more closely involved with
   monitoring projects, from the very beginning, follow through if and
   when the President says to make sure a project works.

   In our interview, Dickerson emphasized a strategy that will focus upon
   working with agencies to ensure that IT projects are well planned and
   managed, not just diving in as a "digital SWAT team," as some media
   accounts have suggested.

   "Plan A is always to approach the agencies collaboratively," he said.
   "They want the same things that we want. Most of the time, that's what
   I expect to have happen. Most of the time, that should be sufficient
   for what we want to do. I also think that the Digital Service, ideally,
   is a kind of rallying point and a coordination point for all of the
   different parts, because there are a lot of people interested in
   helping government do better at technology delivery. There's agency
   staff, there's a lot of new blood in the agencies, there's new agency
   CIOs, there's agency CTOs, there's contractors that are new in the
   game, there's the PIFs, there's 18F. There's a lot of energy around
   this right now. Ideally, the Digital Service will a place to coordinate
   and make sure all of those groups are getting what they need."

   On transparency and delivery

   Whether the White House and agencies can find a way to make these new
   components grafted into existing institutions function well is an open
   question, and one that will only be answered if the failure rate for
   government IT projects goes down and the speed and quality of delivery
   increases. So far, the news of the USDS launch has been greeted with
   excitement amongst supporters of the Obama administration and cautious,
   calibrated enthusiasm outside of it.

   "We have to applaud any effort that works to ensure effective delivery
   of IT solutions, particularly efforts that enable industry and
   government to partner together" said David Wennergren, senior vice
   president for tech policy at the Professional Services Council, the
   national trade association of the government professional and technical
   services industry. "If you go through the playbook, a lot of those
   plays really reflect and align with recommendations that PSC has been
   making for some time, including customer involvement, workforce
   training, modular contracting, strong program management, and
   performance metrics."

   Wennergren said that the USDS is a good foundational start but will be
   limited in scope by the number of people there. (OMB estimates 7-10
   staff this year, expanding to 25 if Congress provides funding.) "The
   key to success is recognizing that given a limited number of people,
   how do you select the right projects that deliver the most value," said
   Wennergren. "Picking the right things to work on is very important." He
   also emphasized that the new USDS is just a first step in a process
   that needs a lot of other steps as well.

   "This can't take the place of more substantive IT and acquisition
   reform," said Wennergren. "Other things like FITARA are just the first
   step in a more broad agenda. We want to find ways to institutionalize
   reform. It's hard to not be supportive of something that's going to
   make IT delivery better, though -- this idea of finding experts -- like
   Healthcare.gov example that led to Mikey being appointed - if you can
   get smart people involved, this will get better."

   Wennergren urged the administration and Congress to take more steps
   that allow industry to participate in improving services. "What we see
   is a dramatic shift in the way the technology market is operating," he
   said. "People are looking for broader things than infrastructure as a
   service. We need to tap into broader industry expertise to partner with
   government from the start.

   One of the issues that we face is that there is more flexibility in the
   acquisition process than is used. We are missing out on the
   opportunities afforded by changing to technologies to change how work
   gets done. Buying a weapon system is different than buying a technology
   system in the 21st century."

   “The Healthcare.gov launch was a debacle because politically empowered
   officials who didn’t understand the technology kept meddling instead of
   offering clear direction and letting experts do their job,” said
   Representative Darrell Issa (R-CA), in a statement. As the chairman of
   the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Issa has been a
   leading critic of the administration's use of technology, particularly
   the botched rollout of the Healthcare.gov marketplace.

   “The president is right in looking to the private sector to improve
   federal IT practices, and establishing a collaboration center has been
   a bipartisan proposal in Congress," he said. "To work, this process has
   to be fully transparent and not another episode where appointees try to
   steer technology decisions they don’t fully understand behind closed
   doors.”

   That last bit -- "transparency -- has proven to be far easier said that
   done in government IT, at all levels of government. The Government
   Accountability Office found that one prominent instrument of
   transparency, the highly touted online IT Dashboard launched by former
   U.S. CIO Vivek Kundra to facilitate public monitoring of government IT
   projects, had not been updated publicly for 15 of the past 24 months,
   with inconsistent ratings of risk and progress. In May, VanRoekel told
   the Senate that "Since 2012, our PortfolioStat data-driven
   accountability sessions have resulted in over $2.5 billion in
   identified cost savings and $1.9 billion in realized savings."

   David Powner, the Government Accountability Office's director of
   information technology issues, told the Senate Appropriations
   subcommittee on financial services and general government this spring
   that these goals aren't ambitious enough, given the GAO's estimates of
   some $3 billion more in annual savings that are possible. Powner also
   told the Senate that agencies have major IT investments that are not
   accurately described as "reds," or high-risk, on the dashboard. When I
   asked about data quality issues or whether the dashboard ratings were
   an accurate representation of where projects or initiatives stand, the
   US CIO explained how he was monitoring the health of IT projects.

   "The IT Dashboard is really intended as a tool for agencies to use to
   manage their IT internally, less about how are we checking up on
   things, from the central standpoint, where we are going in and flagging
   stuff based on certain criteria," said VanRoekel, in answer to my
   question about the tool's potential utility for tracking USDS work.
   "There are things we watch pretty closely, like people are not hitting
   budget, if they're changing their due dates or changing their budget
   projections throughout the lifestyle of a project, or things like that.
   Then, I get to see those changes and we can react to those things."

   He expanded a bit more about his thinking on the value of a public
   dashboard in a follow up answer. "The theory is that, sometimes in
   government, if you change from a yellow to a red or something, it
   creates a different dynamic than if you have a thoughtful conversation
   about the approach someone's taking on getting something done," he
   said. "We believe in our heart of hearts that transparency plays a
   positive role in that stuff, as a great mechanism. I just want to make
   sure that we're super smart about how we're doing that and how we're
   manifesting that in insuring that we see great success."

   If OMB is already communicating with agencies directly and plans to
   expand direct audits and engagement through the USDS, it could help to
   prevent some failures or rescue ailing IT investments. The management
   methodology that VanRoekel is applying, PortfolioStat, will be familiar
   to viewers of "The Wire," who may remember the Comstat meetings held by
   the Baltimore Police Department, or the TechStat reviews that Kundra
   held.

   If OMB and the Office of E-Government find that keeping issues with
   projects out of the public eye by not updating dashboards is an
   effective management strategy, the results should show it. At this
   point, it's fair to say that the White House was not closely enough
   engaged in what was happening with the health insurance marketplace at
   CMS until after its launch, nor particularly transparent about the
   status of fixing it over the winter as the media and political storm
   that surrounded the implementation of the Affordable Care Act raged
   online and in cable news.

   Not publishing the actual status of progress towards milestones online
   as open data or updating, however, may not recover public trust. For
   example, look at the digital government spotlight data on the IT
   Dashboard, which tracks some agency progress towards relatively
   uncontroversial national strategy milestones: it has not been updated
   in 2014, despite legitimate agency progress. Even if it's not uncommon
   for a new public official or the second term of a presidential
   administration to let initiatives introduced by a predecessor moulder,
   the shift does highlight how whatever is not institutionalized by
   Congress can shift in priority. (Whether a President Clinton, Bush,
   Paul, Christie, Perry, Ryan, Rubio or Biden would keep the USDS might
   be up for debate in a year or two. Maryland governor Martin O'Malley's
   data-driven style of management makes him, at least, likely to retain a
   governance system that works.)

   If making things "open" makes them better, though, as the GDS's design
   principles explicitly assert that making things "open makes them
   better" and the USDS' 13th play is to "default to open," the public
   should expect to see not only improvements to the IT Dashboard but also
   a clear explanation of what digital services are being transformed and
   where the work stands. Just take a look at the United Kingdom's
   gov.uk's page for electoral registration to see how this can be done
   well, and then compare it to Perfomance.gov to see how much room
   remains for improvement. At least one agency has been demonstrating how
   this works in practice for months: The Consumer Financial Protection
   Bureau's "Open Tech" site shows their work and recruits developers to
   code for Uncle Sam in the process.

   While the playbook's "default to open" is a visible nudge to change
   other federal agency's culture and processes, it's only the latest
   nudge from OMB, going back to the 2009 Open Government Directive or
   more recent Open Data Executive Order. Whether agencies view this as
   more than a compliance exercise is another matter, particularly when
   projects aren't going so well and products don't work as designed.

   "It's difficult," said Bracken. "It's easier to set the dial to open
   when things are fundamentally broken than when they're not publicly
   broken. The question for any group around a central government that has
   a digital remit is whether they're there to make a fundamental change,
   not just a bolt-on, and if they going to put openness at the heart of
   changing the system and culture. Ideally, you do both."

   Dickerson expressed optimism that he'll be able to communicate how the
   work is going throughout the process. "I hope to be pretty open and
   transparent about how things are going as we go along," he said. "I
   don't know what those channels will be, exactly, as we're just setting
   everything up, but hopefully you'll be able to see. You won't have to
   wait two years to ask the question: week to week, you'll be able to
   follow the developments as you want to." Whether the White House
   communications shop lets him engage freely and speak frankly in online
   forums remains to be seen.

   "As far as a clear tactic, and we started it on day 1, is putting the
   TechFAR and the playbook up on Github right away," said VanRoekel.
   "We're already getting comments, we're already closing some comments.
   We're going to check in later today on what that's been looking like
   throughout the day. Making the work we do open and collaborative as
   much as we can, where it has great effect, is something that's
   definitely the spirt of this team."

   Within 48 hours, the administration received 22 pull requests to the
   playbook, closing 13 of them, and 15 issues, closing 5 of them. One
   open pull request to watch comes from new chief data officer for the
   U.S. Department of Transportation, Dan Morgan, noting that "open source
   is commercial."

   Proactivity, reactivity and high expectations

   Fixing projects gone awry has immense value, but stopping them from
   becoming that way might be even more so, given the $80 billion dollars
   spent on information technology every year by the U.S. federal
   government. One answer that became clear in my joint interview with
   VanRoekel and Dickerson is that they both believe that the USDS won't
   just be a reactive entity. If so, that will address of the threads of
   concern I heard from other parties I asked about the initiative.

   "Really, the goal here is less of really taking what has been
   traditionally more of a reactive stance to this stuff and getting more
   proactive on the most important engagements on citizen-facing
   services," said VanRoekel. "How we manifest the oversight that [deputy
   US CIO] Lisa's team will be doing on those projects and projecting that
   outward is to be determined. We're taking a very agile approach. We're
   going to start small and work our way through this. Hopefully, Lisa and
   Mikey are going to work very closely together on how that stuff will
   manifest."

   Red Hat's Hellekson, for one, currently has more questions than
   answers:

     The really interesting questions come when you put the USDS is the
     context of the Federal IT strategy and a longer-term vision for what
     government IT should be. Here, I’m hard-pressed, because I’m not
     really sure how the USDS is meant to succeed. Is it designed to
     accrete web and mobile projects over time, as the UK’s GDS has done?
     Is it meant to be a kind of consultancy to other groups, making them
     more successful? Since it’s led by one of the saviors of
     healthcare.gov, will it become a team of firefighters, rescuing
     faltering websites? Once we understand that, how will USDS serve the
     tactical goals of cloud first, shared first, and the FDCCI? How will
     we know that it’s doing a better job than a private contractor? How
     will we know it’s better than publishing the Playbook and TechFAR
     alone? There’s a lot to be learned from the UK’s experience with
     this, and Mark Thompson has leveled some very important questions at
     GDS which apply just as easily to the USDS. I encourage you to read
     it.

   Another, still-unanswered question is the extent to which the USDS can
   shift how IT projects are scoped out, proposed, bid upon, managed and
   scrapped, if they don't work.

   "The question is to what degree will a small number of very capable
   people paint rusty trains or build new ones," said Bracken. "Now,
   building trains in digital is so cheap; the challenge is shutting down
   the old ones. That's where you need teeth." (If the U.S. CIO proves
   willing and able to power down more IT failures as well save money by
   consolidating IT services, we'll know if the USDS has some bite.)

   "The problem with these groups, especially the consultancy level, is
   the risk that you're the first to the scene of the next accident,"
   Bracken elaborated. "You're a sort of technical ambulance chaser that
   getting ready to fix the next screwup. If people of that caliber do
   nothing else than fix really shambolically broken systems, then that's
   just great. Nonetheless, one has to ask the question if those are the
   best uses of their skills? Or should someone not have decided to spent
   hundreds of thousands of pounds on proprietary technology built by a
   company that has no experience with digital services?"

   The best way to prevent a visit to the emergency room is to get regular
   checkups, focus on preventative health care and identify and mitigate
   high risk behaviors. In the UK, the GDS has made progress on all of
   those fronts.

   "We've made the relationship between technology and government better,"
   said Bracken. "We're part of a shop that saved the country £13.4
   billion pounds last year, and £10 billion the year before." To judge
   the success of the USDS in 3 years, he suggested, "I'd lead with other
   questions: What have you fixed? What have you stopped happening?"

   On that count, the White House told me to stay tuned and judge the USDS
   by its results. "We're brand new," said Dickerson. "I can only speak
   for myself and what I'm hoping for and believing as we get into this,
   and that's if we make -- again, using Healthcare.gov as the reference
   point -- Healthcare.gov-sized impacts on even a handful of government
   projects, then I will like my time has been well spent. Obviously, we
   have ambitions of doing even more than that, scaling up from those few
   projects that we're going to focus on in the first few months into
   things that are generalizable and will really improve the process all
   across the agencies."

   Given the anger, doubt and frustration prevalent in the public
   discourse around government IT, the only way public trust in the
   federal government's ability to use technology well for something other
   than surveillance and warfare will be through the deployment of
   beautiful, modern Web services that work. Jen Pahlka has explicitly
   connected government's technical competency to trust in this young
   century.

   "If government is to regain the trust and faith of the public, we have
   to make services that work for users the norm, not the exception," she
   told to Government Technology, after leaving the White House. Mayors,
   governors and presidents are experiencing the truth of her statement
   around the country, from small towns to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

   "The first thing you have to do is show what's possible," said Pahlka,
   in our interview. "Mikey and others have already done that with
   Healthcare.gov. Then you have to show that those outcomes are
   replicable. That's what the USDS team will do next, working on a few
   key areas that really matter. Then you make that approach the new
   normal, which is going to take a long time. But the important thing is
   to have started, and that enough people believe we can do better."

   The hardest task before the newly launched USDS, along with 18F, the
   Presidential Innovation Fellows, and millions of other federal
   employees, is not only to deliver basic services, but to go beyond,
   remembering that the American government has accomplished the seemingly
   impossible before, and can do so again.

   "What I've said to other engineers, if you could only remember one
   thing from what we've talked about for two hours, it would be that a
   huge amount of what people think is immovable, unfixable, intractable
   -- 'there's nothing we can do here, government will never change its
   behavior, this is just hopeless' there's a lot of people with that
   attitude, both inside and outside -- and a really shocking amount of
   the time, maybe 60% of the time, the thing that you think can't be done
   really can, if you would work on it," said Dickerson. "A lot of the
   stuff people think agencies can't do, because it's prohibited by the
   FAR [Federal Acquisitions Regulation] or this or that, well, it's
   really not. You just had to try. If there was just one thing from
   Healthcare.gov that we learned, I would say it's that: a lot of these
   problems that we've assumed are unsolvable really aren't."

       While the Pirate Party within Germany was facing internal disputes

       Parliament, Julia Reda, is seeking to make the European Commission
       appointment process more transparent by crowdsourcing questions for
       the designated Commissioner for Digital Economy & Society and the

Germany Releases Open Data Action Plan Amidst Grassroots Enthusiasm and
Pirate Party Turmoil
       The German government on Wednesday unveiled its open data action
       plan to implement the open data charter established by the G8, now
       G7, countries. But while German open government advocates welcomed
       its release, for them it does not go far enough. Even as the open
       data movement is taking new hold in Germany on the local level with
       encouragement from the new Code for Germany effort, in the national
       Pirate Party, the supposed German net party, internal leadership
       disputes are overshadowing its digital agenda. GO
