Winston Churchill on arts funding: how Twitter twists history to suit modern
agendas

   No, he didn't say that

   It is incredibly public-spirited of Winston Churchill to provide his
   view on cuts and the arts in 2013. Especially as the great man died in
   1965. Spend enough time on Facebook or Twitter and you'll eventually
   come across a quote which purportedly emerged from that bulldog visage
   in the darkest days of World War II. It has Churchill responding to a
   plan to cut money for the arts to fund the war effort by saying: "Then
   what are we fighting for?"

   It's a pithy line and it sounds a little Churchillian but the great man
   never said it. That hasn't stopped its endless repetition, including by
   Kevin Spacey in speeches and this cringeworthy television interview.
   There is a similar, more nuanced discussion reported in Winston S
   Churchill by Martin Gilbert. In Vol 6, Finest Hour 1939 – 1941:

     The second matter concerned evacuation in the event of invasion or
     even before invasion. This had been raised in several forms. The
     Foreign Office had put forward a suggestion to prepare to evacuate
     the Royal Family, and also the Government, to "some part of the
     Overseas Empire, where the war would continue to be waged". When
     [Desmond] Morton passed on this request to Churchill, the Prime
     Minister answered: "I believe we shall make them rue the day they
     try to invade our island. No such discussion can be permitted."

     At the same moment, the Director of the National Gallery, Kenneth
     Clark, suggested that the paintings in the National Gallery should
     be sent from London to Canada. Churchill was likewise against this
     suggestion and emphatically so. "No," he minuted, "bury them in
     caves and cellars. None must go. We are going to beat them."

   But that anecdote does not so easily play into the screeching rhetoric
   of today's 140-character political ding-dongs. Instead the bogus quote,
   which can be traced back to a Village Voice article from 2008,
   continues to bounce around. It feels true because those peddling it
   wish it to be so. What better stick to beat the Government with than
   the words of Britain's greatest war time leader?

   The distorting effects of social media on historical quotations are
   pronounced but aggressive. Admittedly, fallacious shaping of a
   narrative is nothing new. Slapdash historians have been guilty of it
   ever since Ug The Caveman lied about his mammoth kill on the cave wall.
   The difference now is that the fast repetition of Twitter and Facebook
   gives fake sentiments a quick air of plausibility. Marilyn Monroe
   didn't say "nothing lasts forever", but on social media she will keep
   saying it endlessly. If we want the next generation to have any notion
   of real history beyond warmed-up, fabricated aphorisms, we'd best start
   teaching them to fact-check.
