5 Reasons for the Zephyr Teachout Phenomenon, and 5 Reasons Andrew Cuomo Is
Still Governor
     __________________________________________________________________

   This photo is Zephyr Teachout talking strategy with Eddie Kay,
   legendary labor organizer and former head of SEIU 1199.

   “New York’s a small town run by 1,000 decision-makers.” So says Hank
   Sheinkopf, a consultant in New York politics for more than 40 years and
   bouncer for the billionaire-fueled New York Democratic establishment.
   So how did Zephyr, who was not one of those decision-makers, have such
   an impact? I’ll try to answer that question and offer some observations
   her campaign and what it meant. My first stab at the question was back
   in July, in this Salon piece.

   Here are some more thoughts, now that the primary is over. First, here
   are 5 reasons Cuomo won this primary (though he won it with a
   shockingly low percentage of the vote, roughly 20 points less than
   Spitzer got in his primary for Governor in 2006).
    1. Cuomo “won” because he spent more than $11 million on TV alone
       while Zephyr Teachout spent $500,000 on the whole campaign. Cuomo
       won for one reason — his opponent had no name ID, and he spent
       between $11M and $15M on this election. Money in politics is used
       to talk to voters through mail and TV. Without it, you are mute.
       Zephr Teachout didn’t do one piece of mail, or a single TV ad.
       There was a lot of evidence that primary voters, when given a light
       persuasion message, flipped to Teachout. She got a big chunk of the
       vote without spending very much at all. But there was no money to
       deliver such a message. Given a bit more money, or a bit more time,
       the outcome would have been different. To put it another way, Cuomo
       paid roughly $48 for every vote he got, where Zephyr paid roughly
       $2.70 (UPDATE: Philip Bump has a more accurate count, and
       calculated that it’s $60.62 for Cuomo to $1.57 for Zephyr, though
       all the data isn’t in yet). That’s a very big differential, in
       terms of the power of the messaging. If Zephyr had had a bit more
       money, she could have easily won.
    2. The liberal establishment went for Cuomo. Aside from money, Cuomo
       had the machinery of elections on his side. The list of
       establishment supporters backing Cuomo is long. It includes 1199
       SEIU and the Hotel and Motel Trades Council, two of the most
       powerful unions in New York. Hillary Clinton did a robocall for
       Cuomo, while helping very few other Democrats in 2014. So did Randi
       Weingarten, President of the American Federal of Teachers. New York
       City Mayor Bill de Blasio, City Council Speaker Melissa
       Mark-Viverito, Senator Kirstin Gillibrand, Senator Chuck Schumer,
       House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Emily’s List all
       endorsed the ticket, with women’s group Emily’s List endorsing
       Cuomo’s running mate Kathy Hochul while refusing to endorse Zephyr
       Teachout for Governor despite her gender and pro-choice stance.
       Most Mayors in New York, as well as the entire Congressional
       delegation, went for the ticket. The Working Families Party
       endorsed him. The Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver did. And so on.
    3. The Occupy bloc isn’t enough, but it matters. Zephyr’s base bloc
       isn’t enough to win a primary, but it is part of a potential
       coalition that could do so. It’s the Occupy voter bloc, perhaps
       what Howard Dean had from 2002–2004 but infused with an economic
       justice frame. It is the only organized voting group that is able
       to sit outside the political establishment. They were willing to
       back a neophyte female candidate with no money and no establishment
       support against the marriage equality guy with $35 million in the
       bank who balanced the state budget four years in a row. It’s not a
       complete coalition, but it is a piece of a broader coalition.
    4. Andrew Cuomo will be Governor, but his career is over. Cuomo will
       win in November. He will govern for another four years, or until he
       is indicted. But he will not hold another elected office, because
       he has proven himself a very good machine boss but a very bad
       candidate. The level of petty vindictiveness reflects a brilliant
       man who simply cannot help himself but indulge his desire for
       control. Interestingly, Zephyr won Albany County, and people there
       know him best.
    5. The New York establishment hates and fears Andrew Cuomo. Zephyr
       Teachout is a great candidate, and she ran an excellent campaign.
       But Cuomo had a lot of enemies, and her campaign gave them all a
       chance to vent. It was like a dam broke, and every anti-Cuomo
       sentiment poured through the wreckage. I saw this up close as a
       volunteer for Zephyr; a surprising number of people at her rallies
       had had close experiences with Cuomo, and hated him for his
       micro-managing style and general petty vindictiveness. I heard from
       former state employees who complained of his staffs’ screaming and
       stapler throwing, librarians angry that Cuomo was selling public
       libraries to be bulldozed for luxury condos, and even the
       representative of an ultra-conservative wealthy plutocrat who said
       his boss hated Cuomo because “he is a fucking liar.” But that said,
       while hating him, they went along with him. For instance, New York
       politician Ed Koch still wouldn’t forgive Cuomo for a campaign
       stunt from 1977: “During the ugly 1977 New York City mayoral
       primary battle between Koch and Mario Cuomo, Cuomo campaign signs
       appeared throughout Queens — Cuomo’s home turf — reading, “Vote for
       Cuomo, Not the Homo.” Cuomo’s son Andrew, then 19, worked alongside
       his father on the campaign.” That didn’t stop Koch from cutting
       Cuomo a check for $1000 in 2010. (Koch passed away in 2013). Now
       that Cuomo’s control of the party is in question, his ability to
       govern will be dramatically weakened. He will be Governor, but no
       longer King.

   Then there’s the flip side of the coin. What was this Zephyr Teachout
   thing all about?
    1. Zephyr Teachout’s career is just beginning. Teachout is a star. The
       New York establishment ignored her at first, but was utterly
       charmed by her by the end of the campaign. She’s got a book coming
       out on political corruption, a good platform from Fordham Law
       School, a deep network of connections, a political base, and and
       the clear chops to be an excellent candidate at any level. Her
       campaign, led by the brilliant former WFP operative Mike Boland,
       suggests she has the ability to pull together an effective
       political operation. She is a star, if not a governor. That’s
       powerful. She needs a platform, but she will find one.
    2. This was a real debate of ideas. This was the most interesting
       election I’ve seen since 2006, when Ned Lamont challenged Joe
       Lieberman for the Senate seat. Lamont defeated Lieberman in the
       primary, but lost in the general election. That year, the
       Presidential candidates — Hillary Clinton, John Edwards, and Barack
       Obama — saw that the anti-Bush left that had emerged in the wake of
       the Iraq war to challenge the pro-war hawks was not dominant in the
       party, and resolved to crush it. They did. There has been such
       intra-party agreement for the past six years over policy that Paul
       Krugman and Matt Yglesias both pronounced the party devoid of real
       debate, except over some minor details (Vox’s headline was “7
       reasons the Democratic coalition is more united than ever”). This
       election, in 2014, is the first signal that there’s real dissent
       within the party, over big stuff. While the core disagreements
       incorporate economic justice as well as national security, it’s not
       a coincidence that Zephyr Teachout was the internet director of
       Howard Dean’s campaign in 2003–2004.
    3. The Occupy bloc has emerged. Zephyr drew her strongest — but not
       only — support from white liberals from the ages of 30–45 years.
       This is the Occupy Wall Street demographic. It is teachers,
       librarians, fracktivists, techies, and publishers. It is also
       heavily networked and organized. Some Cuomo insiders were making
       fun of the fact that Teachout couldn’t draw big crowds, while Cuomo
       could. But this is because Cuomo’s machine organizes constituencies
       in union halls, whereas Teachout’s are on listservs and on Twitter.
       It’s just a different frame of reference, union organizers organize
       at union halls, fracktivists organize on listservs.
    4. Antitrust is an extremely potent issue. Zephyr Teachout
       consistently drew her biggest applause line with “It’s time for
       some good old fashioned trust-busting.” She made a point of saying
       that big cable is too big, and that Amazon is a threat to open
       markets. Zephyr often said she is an old school Democrat. What she
       meant is not just that she backs more funding for schools, but that
       she believes in a redesigned relationship between powerful private
       actors and the state similar to the one implemented by FDR. This is
       first and foremost about a strong an antitrust agenda. Much of this
       can be traced to scholar Barry Lynn at the New America Foundation’s
       Open Markets Program, where Teachout was recently a fellow. An
       intellectual foundation rooted in a robust historical outlook has
       given Teachout the means to become a star, and this foundation
       rests on trust-busting in the private sphere and anti-corruption in
       the public sphere.
    5. Bill De Blasio is gunning for the Governorship, and then the
       Presidency. De Blasio played a key role in bringing down Zephyr,
       but also exposing what is different from his Clintonian progressive
       ideology and Zephyr’s intellectual tradition. De Blasio is not a
       throwback Democrat, he’s a slightly more left-wing version of Bill
       Clinton or Barack Obama. His policy choices, such as Pre-K, paid
       sick leave, but continued Muslim surveillance and stock and frisk
       as well as coordination with large banks and real estate interest,
       are classic New Democrat moves. He believes that Wall Street should
       distribute a bit more lucre to the working class, but this is
       different than the Zephyr Teachout school of breaking up the banks
       or reorganizing corporate power and the state. With this campaign,
       De Blasio has made himself essential to the Democratic party in New
       York. The Working Families Party is now his machine, and he is
       going to ride it as far as it can go. He believes, with some
       justification, that he can win back any disaffected progressives
       alienated during this campaign, while at the same time he can bring
       into his fold a lot of the Cuomo world that didn’t trust him when
       he runs for Governor in 2018. (UPDATE: Since I published this
       piece, I’ve heard that there is real grumbling about De Blasio in
       his old district — nickname is OTB, One Term Bill. That will have
       to wait for another time.)

   I had a lot of fun with this campaign, and I hope you did too. At first
   I observed it from afar, but then I got involved on the ground. What a
   glorious ride. Cuomo is a fascinating and dark figure in American
   politics, and the New York political establishment is both hilariously
   parochial and immensely powerful. Thanks, Zephyr, for making this ride
   possible.

   UPDATE: So some New York contacts read this piece and are giving me
   additional insight. One key part I didn’t, but should have mentioned,
   is the role of running mate Tim Wu and the New York tech community. The
   tech world helped finance the campaigns, and Wu played a bridge between
   that world and Zephyr’s world of anti-corruption activists. Wu is a
   serious and credible candidate. He helped propel the campaign when he
   got the New York Times endorsement for Lt. Governor (which Zephyr
   nearly, but did not, receive).

   Micah Sifry and Andrew Rasiej of Personal Democracy Forum are
   organizers of New York tech politics. They wrote this broad letter to
   Cuomo in 2012, and a lot of important venture capitalists signed it. It
   was a request for public financing of campaigns. Many of those people
   backed Teachout/Wu, as well as Larry Lessig’s Mayday PAC. If the tech
   community starts to put serious money into anti-corruption politics,
   that would be interesting. We’re already seeing engagement on public
   financing and net neutrality, but traditionally VCs have also been
   interested in antitrust because their startups are crushed by
   monopolists. There are of course cross-pressures here.

   Micah wrote: What I find most intriguing about this is the way some
   tech VCs and entrepreneurs really seem to understand their success as
   tied to (or born up from) the open Internet and how we may link that to
   open politics or open democracy (defined as a system where the little
   guy can enter and compete on an open playing field, rather than one
   dominated by political and economic monopolists and duopolists). In
   other words, Comcast and Verizon are to the 21st century economy what
   the Democrats and the Republicans are to the political system.

   The second important observation from a few folks is that Zephyr
   crushed it upstate. She won over 20 counties outside of New York City,
   and this is largely due to her stance on fracking, as well as the
   really bad rural economy that results from neoliberal urban focused
   financial politics. Cuomo has tried to assuage this with lots of tax
   credits and development deals, but, according to Hunter College
   professor Ken Sherrill, “it seems like all that vaunted economic
   development hasn’t reached the average voter.” That’s true. It’s pretty
   much common sense — you don’t do tech startups in cow country, you make
   dairy profitable. Also, Zephyr, though portrayed as a big city
   professor from New York, grew up on a farm in rural Vermont. Upstate
   farmers are actually her people. Here are counties she won (or nearly
   won). There’s a great map of the regional breakdown at the New York
   Times site.

   • Putnam- 53.5% • Dutchess- 57.5% • Ulster- 70.0% • Sullivan- 67.6% •
   Delaware- 63.3% • Greene- 62.1% • Columbia- 77.9% • Rensselaer- 63.4% •
   Albany- 61.9% • Schoharie- 71.7% • Washington- 63.8% • Saratoga- 67.3%
   • Fulton- 54.3% • Montgomery- 54.5% • Otsego- 72.7% • Chenango- 49.9% •
   Madison- 46.8% • Cortland- 60.6% • Tompkins- 70.9% • Tioga- 49.7% •
   Schuyler- 60.7% • Yates- 61.5% • Ontario- 50.8% • Seneca- 56.3% •
   Wayne- 49.1% • Warren- 56.7% • Hamilton- 51.7% • Essex- 48.6% •
   Clinton- 49.4% • St Lawrence- 54.6%

   And the third observation is that the Progressive Change Campaign
   Committee really mattered. They did a GOTV campaign and talked to a lot
   of voters, which was Zephyr’s main weakness.

   Below are a few pictures.
