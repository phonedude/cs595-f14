The Monsoon Reading List

Saturday, August 23, 2014

   Nothing suits a grey monsoon day more than a good book, with garam chai
   (hot tea) and garam garam pakoras (hot savories).

   Enjoy our reading list of monsoon inspired stories, travelogues,
   mysteries and a cookbook appreciated by the Good Earth team this
   season.
   Anita Lal Suggests: The fascinating and revealing story of Frater’s
   journey through India in pursuit of the astonishing Indian summer
   monsoon. Frater’s journey takes him to Bangkok and the cowboy town on
   the Thai-Malaysian border to Rangoon and Akyab in Burma (where the
   front funnels up between the mountains and the sea). Alexander Frater's
   fascinating narrative reveals the exotic, often startling discoveries
   of an ambitious and irresistibly romantic adventure.

   Divya Kapoor Suggests: William Dalrymple decides to retrace the epic
   journey of Marco Polo from Jerusalem to Xanadu, the ruined palace of
   Kubla Kahn, north of Peking. For the first half of the trip he is
   accompanied by Laura, whom he met at a dinner party two weeks before he
   left; for the second half he is accompanied by Louisa, his very
   recently ex-girlfriend. Intelligent and funny.

   Anita Lal Suggests: In the seventh century AD, the Chinese monk
   Xuanzang set off on an epic journey to India to study Buddhist
   philosophy from the Indian masters. Travelling along the Silk Road,
   through the desolate wastes of the Gobi desert and the icy passes of
   Central Asia, braving brigands and blizzards, Xuanzang finally reached
   India. By the time he returned to China eighteen years later, carrying
   with him nearly 600 scriptures which he translated from Sanskrit into
   Chinese, Xuanzang had covered an astonishing 10,000 miles. He also left
   a detailed record of his journey, which remains a valuable source of
   historical information on the regions he traversed. Fourteen hundred
   years later, Mishi Saran follows in Xuanzang’s footsteps to the fabled
   oasis cities of China and Central Asia, and the Buddhist sites and
   now-vanished kingdoms in India, Pakistan and Afghanistan that Xuanzang
   wrote about. Travelling seamlessly back and forth in time between the
   seventh century and the twenty-first, Saran uncovers the past with
   consummate skill even as she brings alive the present through her vivid
   and engaging descriptions of people and places. With its riveting mix
   of lively reportage, high adventure, historical inquiry and personal
   memoir, this delightfully written book is a path-breaking travelogue.

   Beenu Bawa Suggests: A.A. Gill is probably the most read columnist in
   Britain. Every weekend he entertains readers of the Sunday Times with
   his biting observations on television and his unsparing, deeply
   knowledgeable restaurant reviews. Even those who want to hate him
   agree: A. A. Gill is hopelessly, painfully funny. He is one of a tiny
   band of must-read journalists and it is always a disappointment when
   the words “A.A. Gill is Away” appear at the foot of his column. This
   book is the fruit of those absences: 22 long travel pieces that belie
   his reputation as a mere style journalist and master of vitriol: this
   is travel writing of the highest quality and ambition.

   Simran Lal Suggests: When Pico Iyer decided to go to Kyoto and live in
   a monastery, he did so to learn about Zen Buddhism from the inside, to
   get to know Kyoto, one of the loveliest old cities in the world, and to
   find out something about Japanese culture today - not the world of
   businessmen and production lines, but the traditional world of changing
   seasons and the silence of temples, of the images woven through
   literature, of the lunar Japan that still lives on behind the rising
   sun of geopolitical power.

   6-Reading List

   Arya Nerker Suggests:
   “This book resees its subject with rare clarity and power as a painter
   for the 21st century.”—Hilary Spurling, New York Times Book Review
   In a bravura performance, Andrew Graham-Dixon explores Caravaggio’s
   staggering artistic achievements, delving into the original Italian
   sources to create a masterful profile of the mercurial painter. This
   New York Times and Washington Post Notable Book of the Year features
   more than eighty full-color reproductions of the artist’s best
   paintings.
   Neeta Merchant Suggests: An unusual collection of travel pieces by
   writers ranging from M.J. Akbar and Aman Nath to Devdutt Pattanaik,
   Jerry Pinto, Rahul Pandita and Advaita Kala.Featured here are essays on
   the changing face of the popular hill resort-Nainital, living as a
   Pakistani in the remote city of Copenhagen, a woman traveller being
   strip-searched at an American airport and traversing the dark interiors
   of the haunted Bhangarh Fort in Rajasthan, among others. Focusing on
   the Indian experience, the book captures a country of shifting
   landscapes – physical, cultural, psychological. A departure from the
   traditional travel narrative, this is a unique collection for the
   travel-book buff.

   Beenu Bawa Suggests: A literary exploration of the Beats’ encounter
   with India in the 1960s, a journey that inspired and influenced
   generations. Drawing from extensive research, undiscovered letters,
   journals, and memoirs, acclaimed biographer Deborah Baker has woven a
   many layered literary mystery out of Ginsberg’s odyssey. A Blue Hand
   follows him and his companions as they travel from the ashrams of the
   Himalayan foothills to Delhi opium dens and the burning pyres of
   Benares. In their restless, comic and oftimes tortured search for
   meaning, the Beats looked to India for answers while India looked to
   the West.

   Tara Lal Suggests: Josephine Tey re-creates one of history's most
   famous and vicious crimes in her classic bestselling novel, a must read
   for connoisseurs of fiction. The Daughter of Time is an ingeniously
   plotted, beautifully written, and suspenseful tale, a great achievement
   from one of mystery writing's most gifted masters.

   Amrita Mahale Suggests: Japan’s most highly regarded novelist now
   vaults into the first ranks of international fiction writers with this
   heroically imaginative novel, which is at once a detective story, an
   account of a disintegrating marriage, and an excavation of the buried
   secrets. As this compelling story unfolds, the tidy suburban realities
   of Okada’s vague and blameless life, spent cooking, reading, listening
   to jazz and opera and drinking beer at the kitchen table, are turned
   inside out, and he embarks on a bizarre journey, guided (however
   obscurely) by a succession of characters, each with a tale to tell.

   Anita Lal Suggests: “Monsoon Diary” weaves a fascinating food narrative
   that combines authentic vegetarian recipes from South India with tales
   from Shoba Narayan's life, stories of her delightfully eccentric
   family, and reflections on Indian culture.

   Nida Naik suggests: The clouds drift across the bright blue sky-all
   except one - Little Cloud trails behind. He is busy changing shapes to
   become a fluffy sheep, a zooming airplane, and even a clown with a
   funny hat. Eric Carle's trademark collages will make every reader want
   to run outside and discover their very own little cloud. As minimalist
   as the text, these images may well inspire kids to cast more creative
   glances at the sky. (Publishers Weekly)
