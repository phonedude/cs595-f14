   Foxconn has long been associated as the partner for Apple, assembling
   the majority of the U.S. company’s iPhones and iPads.

          A man walks past a logo of a Foxconn factory in Wuhan, Hubei
          province, in this August 31, 2012, file photo.
          Reuters

   But few people know the Taiwanese contract manufacturer, also known as
   Hon Hai Precision industry, has been quietly working with Google.

   People familiar with the matter told The Wall Street Journal that
   Foxconn has been working with former Android executive Andy Rubin since
   last year to carry out the U.S. company’s vision for robotics.

   To speed up robot deployment at its own factories, Foxconn Chairman
   Terry Gou met with Rubin in Taipei recently and they discussed new
   robotic technologies, they said.

   At the meeting, Gou expressed excitement over new automation
   technologies demonstrated by Rubin, they said. Rubin also asked Gou to
   help integrate a technology company that Google is acquiring as
   Foxconn’s strength lies in mechanical engineering.

   Google set up a new robotics group and acquired eight robotics
   companies last year, including Boston Dynamics, an engineering company
   that has designed mobile research robots for the Pentagon. The New York
   Times first reported Google’s robotics efforts and the acquisitions in
   December.

   The report also said the targets of Google’s new robotics team are in
   manufacturing — such as electronics assembly, which is now largely
   manual — and competing with companies like Amazon in retailing.

   The cooperation comes as Foxconn has been striving to accelerate
   automation efforts at its factories amid challenges of rising labor
   costs and workplace disputes in China, where it has more than a million
   workers. Foxconn’s chairman has reiterated his ambitions to build
   factories with robots in recent years as the company seeks to transform
   itself into a high-tech manufacturer focusing on high-margin,
   capital-intensive products such as automobile and medical equipment.

   Analysts said the partnership makes sense as Foxconn, the world’s
   largest contract manufacturer of electronics devices, can provide
   Google the best testing ground for its new robotics technology. They
   said Google is expected to build a new robotic operating system for
   manufacturers, just like the Android operating system for mobile
   computing devices. A successful robotics operating system would further
   strengthen Google’s position in the technology industry.

   “Foxconn needs Google’s help to step up automation at its factories as
   the company has the lowest sales per employee among the contract
   makers, given its large workforce,” said Wanli Wang, an analyst at CIMB
   Securities. “Using robots to replace human workers would be the next
   big thing in the technology industry. Not just Google, other major
   technology companies such as Microsoft and Amazon also have been
   developing robotics technology to capture the future growth
   opportunities.”

   Online retailer Amazon.com has said it is developing pilotless flying
   vehicles that can deliver packages within a half hour of customers
   placing an order.

   Separately, Foxconn has been actively seeking locations for research
   and technology investment in the U.S. In November, the company said it
   might invest $40 million in manufacturing and research facilities in
   Pennsylvania. The company also sent some engineers to Massachusetts
   Institute of Technology to learn the latest manufacturing
   and automation technology, the people said.

   The Taiwan-based company has been seeking new avenues of growth as
   revenue from contract manufacturing slows. It has been making a push
   into software development and telecom services, and has also branched
   out into the retail market by selling its own-brand mobile
   accessories. On Monday, Foxconn reported its January revenue edged up
   just 0.3% from a year earlier to 314.55 billion New Taiwan dollars
   ($10.37 billion), further highlighting the need to diversify its
   revenue stream.
