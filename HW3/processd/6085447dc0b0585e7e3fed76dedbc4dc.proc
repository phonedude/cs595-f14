   Sewing-machines-and-3D-printing

   Opinion: a digitally-driven revival of interest in sewing proves that
   people want to create, but the 3D-printing movement is failing to cater
   to a market that wants something practical and beautiful, says
   Alexandra Lange.
     __________________________________________________________________

   In March, Slate Magazine's Seth Stevenson provided a public service
   when he borrowed a Solidoodle 4, pitched as the "accessible",
   "affordable" 3D printer, and attempted to print a bottle opener from
   Thingiverse. Results, as they say, vary, but he ended up, after a
   series of phone calls and false starts, with "a functionless,
   semi-decorative piece of plastic."

   The bumbling encounter with technology is a popular stratagem for
   Slate, but here it pointed directly to the reason we're not seeing a 3D
   printer in every den. I've seen those rhino heads, those dinosaur
   skulls. They do not fill me with delight, but remind me instead of the
   cheap toys my kids bring home from birthday parties and I throw away in
   the night. Why bother? How is printing your Triceratops at home more
   creative, more making, than buying one from a store? In either case,
   step one is scrolling through pages of online options, pointing and
   clicking in 2D.

   Stevenson concluded that 3D printing was no place for amateurs, but for
   tinkerers. Those able to work under the hood of the printer: to
   understand the terms in the manual, to customise or create their own
   products for Thingiverse. For such tinkerers, neighbourhood printing
   hubs like Techshop, where subscribers can go to use physical or digital
   tools, make more sense. Designers taking advantage of 3D printers'
   capabilities for rapid prototyping and small-batch production have
   already started farming out the actual printing to places like
   Shapeways. When we stopped having to fax even weekly, we all got rid of
   those machines.

   But then Stevenson took a turn toward the larger question of craft. He
   wrote, "Once upon a time, people purchased sewing patterns (like a
   program from Thingiverse) and yards of fabric (like filament) and they
   made their own clothes. I wasn't alive back then, but I'm pretty sure
   the process sucked."
   The digital age has not turned sewing into a novelty, but spawned a
   revival of interest

   I must be older than Stevenson, because my mother and grandmother sewed
   clothes for me. My mother, aunt and I have all sewed clothes and quilts
   for my children. They are not amateurishly constructed. We managed to
   make them while also holding down full time jobs. And judging from the
   extremely active online sewing community, the active trade in old
   machines and patterns on Ebay, and the ease with which one can locate a
   scan of a thirty-year-old sewing machine manual, the digital age has
   not turned sewing into a novelty, but spawned a revival of interest. In
   fact, if 3D printers are truly going to become a consumer good, they
   have a lot to learn from the sewing machine.

   Because Stevenson snidely generalised from his own limited experience,
   he missed the instructive dialogue between craft and the machine age.
   Post-industrial sewing is not a freak but a respite. In Evgeny
   Morozov's recent New Yorker essay on the new makers, he quotes
   historian Jackson Lears' critique of the Arts & Crafts movement as "a
   revivifying hobby for the affluent." I'd say middle-class: (mostly)
   women who aren't seeing what they want, at a price they can afford, in
   the marketplace.

   There’s an appetite for the "refashion," recycling an old dress or an
   adult T-shirt, and turning it into something new. Once upon a time, the
   use of flour sacks as fabric prompted grain-sellers to start offering
   their wares in flowered cotton bags. If some boutique grain company
   began doing that again, there would be a run on their product. Under
   the technology radar, there's a community of people sharing free
   patterns, knowledge and results, without the interpolation of brands,
   constantly obsolescent machinery, or the self-serving and myth-making
   rhetoric Morozov finds in Chris Anderson's Makers. There are the
   answers to the questions "Why bother?" and "How creative?" Rather than
   sewing being a cautionary tale, 3D printing can't become a consumer
   good until it learns a few lessons from why we sew now.

   Number one: what's not available on the market. If you have a girl
   child in America, it is often difficult to find reasonably-priced, 100
   per cent cotton clothing for her without ruffles, pink or purple,
   butterflies and hearts. If you go to the boy section, you run into an
   equally limiting set of colors, navy and army green, and an abundance
   of sports insignia. A full-skirted dress, a petite skirt, prints for
   the plus-sized – there are plenty of styles that are not novelties but,
   when not in fashion, disappear from stores. Online you can find
   patterns to make any of the above for less than $10, and fabric at the
   same price per yard. Online you can find step-by-step explanations,
   with photos, of how to make that pattern. That world of patterns is
   vast, constantly updated, and historically rich. Yes, sewing your own
   garment will take some time, but then you will have exactly what you
   want. That's why women bother.
   At the Makerbot showroom in Boston, they showed nothing that was useful

   The consumer-facing side of 3D printing is Thingiverse, where you can
   download a digital file (like a pattern) to tell your 3D printer what
   to print. This is a little different than sewing because, while you can
   choose your filament (at $43 per roll), you don't have much input. You
   are not cutting, pinning. You are not customising. And a skim of the
   offerings suggests not so much items not on the market, or even items
   desperately needed, but items to show off that you 3D printed
   something. Vases, figurines, intricate and unwearable wearables. Why
   spend the time or money? Even at the Makerbot showroom in Boston, they
   showed nothing that was useful (a jet-pack bunny) and few things that
   were beautiful (honeycombed Easter eggs). All objects, no
   problem-solving.

   The only 3D printed object I have ever desired is the Free Universal
   Construction Kit, designed to allow one to attach Lego to Bristle
   Blocks to Zoob. It definitely solves a problem not addressed by the
   market. It's not on the market because the rival toy manufacturers have
   no interest in getting everything to connect. I still wouldn't want to
   print it at home: I would rather send the job to the Makerbot showroom,
   and let someone else mind the machine, because my input would be
   minimal.

   Second lesson: recycling. Say my mother did actually sew something
   amateurishly. That's not the end of the story. A mis-printed jet-pack
   bunny is so much trash (unless I buy a second machine like a Filabot to
   remelt my filament). A mis-sewn seam can be ripped out and redone. An
   old dress can be refashioned into a new one. A favorite vintage piece
   can be copied. Sewing does not create more waste but, potentially,
   less, and the process of sewing is filled with opportunities for
   increasing one's skills and doing it over as well as doing it yourself.
   What are quilts, after all, but a clever way to use every last scrap of
   precious fabric?
   The rapid obsolescence of 3D printers suggests a lifecycle closer to
   that of phone

   So far, 3D printing's DIY aspects seem more akin to the "magic" of an
   ant farm, watching growth behind glass. Sewing lets the maker find
   their own materials, and get involved with every aspect of the process.
   3D printing could do this, and there are classes, but even at the
   Makerbot showroom the primary interaction seemed to be ordering from
   Thingiverse. My local sewing shop has to teach more women to sew to
   survive; I don't see the printer makers coming to the same conclusion.

   In addition, the machines themselves are constantly becoming junk. It's
   not unusual for new technology to change quickly. That's the fourth
   Solidoodle since 2011. Makerbot is on its fifth generation. It is early
   days for 3D printing, and the machines may eventually stabilise. But
   the rapid obsolescence suggests a lifecycle closer to that of a mobile
   phone than of a washing machine, which might also turn consumers off.
   The sewing machine was considered a lifetime purchase.

   Last but not least, sharing. This is the one consumer area where 3D
   printing approaches sewing's success. From the Free Universal
   Construction Kit to full-body scans, the idea of open-source, free, and
   social-media enabled printing has been built-in to the 3D process.
   Showing off what you made is better when you created it, rather than
   printed it out. On the sewing blogs, the process pictures are half the
   fun, and most of the interest. What does it really teach your children
   when you can get doll house furniture on demand, except a desire for
   ever-more-instant gratification? For me to believe in 3D printers as a
   home machine, I'd have to see the digital file equivalent of women in
   their off-hours, making up patterns as they go along, sharing mistakes,
   dreaming better dreams. 3D printing feels bottled up, professionalised,
   too expensive for the experimentation of cut and sew and rip and sew
   again.

   Stevenson wrote, "most people would much rather just get their clothes
   from a store — already assembled by people employing industrial-level
   efficiency and a wide variety of materials," and that's true. What
   Solidoodle and Makerbot and the rest should be looking at is the people
   who have seen everything in the store and found it wanting.

       If you think the history for 3D printers involves a lot of
       stuttering progress, you might want to do some research into the
       history of your beloved sewing machine. It was a hundred years
       between the invention of the first sewing machine and the first
       commercially available production model. It was another 50 years
       before your average home user could afford one.

       This is an interesting article and certainly raises some valid
       points, but it does seem to be comparing apples and oranges.
       Couple of rebuttals in favour of 3D printing:
       1. Sewing machines have been around as a consumer good for over one
       and a half centuries. Consumer available 3D printers have been
       around for a decade? We haven’t even begun to see what mass 3D
       printing can do for the world.
       2. Having no experience with 3D printing at all, I purchased one,
       unpacked it, and within 15 minutes I was printing something I
       downloaded, a bracelet for my sister, a couple of hours it was
       done, she was happy and I was satisfied having made it for her.
       That’s the value proposition and that’s why people will continue to
       purchase them, for that feeling of satisfaction and perceived
       creativity.
       3. After a while of printing toys for friends kids and nicknacks
       for myself I embarked on solving a problem that had been plaguing
       me for months, a bracket for a carburettor on a classic motorcycle
       I’m restoring that I could not source. After a 15-minute measure up
       and a few hours in a free 3D design program. I had a bracket,
       printed it and it worked a charm. Useful no?
       4. You still don’t see a sewing machine in every household.
       5. If you’re paying $43 a roll for filament you are getting taken
       for a ride.

       Fantastic observations. As someone who has been in design and
       manufacturing at the makers end for the last 35 years (toolmaker/
       machinist) I am very dubious of the enthusiasm 3D printers have
       engendered.
       They have their place, but in my opinion it is really in the
       development and prototyping area and as you pointed out they have a
       lot of work to do before they are useful for much else.
     * Beaulecaste
       Opples and Aranges. 3D printing is non-comparable to 2D sewing. And
       as the guy somewhere below me said – it took a good 50 years for
       the sewing machine to originally reach the homes of an average
       person, as it was first only used in factories and often huge.
       3D printers on the other hand have been out for a while and has
       just started it’s volition into the average Joe’s life. It went
       from industry only, to tinkers (now and in the last 10 years), and
       has started to enter the average Joe’s hands.
     * Josie
       Interesting article! The only thing you’re missing is that any
       reasonably computer savvy person can learn to create their own 3D
       model. It takes a bit of work and time if you’re not highly
       technical, but it’s not any harder than sewing. :)
     * Heather James
       As has been pointed out, the first sewing machines and the first
       computers were barely recognisable compared to what we use today.
       The tablet I am using to type this comment was a science fiction
       dream 25 years ago, when I was playing Oregon Trail with its little
       green stick figures on the Apple 2E’s in my high school library.
       The tablet wasn’t even a thing 7 years ago, when I didn’t pony up
       the extra cash for a wifi capable printer, because we weren’t using
       wifi. Now, I need to replace it because this tablet ONLY prints via
       wifi. The 3D printers can actually do much more than what has been
       discussed here. For example, printers that print metal may not be
       on the consumer market, yet, but they do exist. And 3D printers are
       doing major, important things in the medical world–like turning
       prosthetic manufacture utterly on its ear.
       The first home computers were toys that weren’t terribly useful,
       too. And not that many people bought them. In 10 years, everyone
       will have a 3D printer. And they will be orders of magnitude more
       capable than what we have now.
     * Jens Chr Brynildsen
       I think this article is really great, but the author misses her own
       point? Consumer 3D printers have only been around for six years.
       That’s when the patent for FDM printers elapsed and making printers
       for consumers became possible, so it’s very natural that few have
       them. When 3D printers have been available for a little longer, I
       think we’ll see a clear pattern in who buys one.
       A sowing machine, much like a 3D printer will usually be purchased
       by someone that has an urge to create something. This in itself
       prevents it from being attractive to the ordinary consumer that
       just wants to consume. All creators are usually consumers as well,
       but the average consumer has no interest in making things.
       Anyone can print an existing model, but that in itself does not
       make a 3D printer something that everyone needs. I see 3D-printing
       as a craft that must be learnt. Not the operation of the printer
       itself, but using it for something other than printing existing
       models require skills. Those that have crafting skills can create
       things that the average consumer can only dream of. For 3D-printing
       to be useful, it’s not a matter of printing plastic toys, but
       rather to solve real problems or create new products.
       When I was a kid, anything made of plastic could not be repaired.
       3D-printing solves that as long as you know how to make a 3D model.
       This is 100% comparable to buying new clothes vs repairing them.
       The average consumer will buy new pants. The creator will mend the
       existing ones, re-use them or even make them even cooler.
       3D-printing also solves making hard-to-get spare parts and other
       things that are not commercially available. My primary use of my 3D
       printer is to make things that does not yet exist. It’s not to
       print novelty items for the kids. It can however be used for both
       and it is thus VERY comparable to sowing. Many have a sowing
       machine but mostly for the bragging rights or in the event that
       something needs to be mended.
       I think 3D printers today can serve a very similar purpose, but the
       future potential is much bigger than in sowing machines. Imagine if
       companies like IKEA made available 3D models of all their spare
       parts. It would be nice just to print it rather than driving to
       pick up a tiny plastic piece that was missing in the package?
       Imagine when 3D printers become just as fast, easy to use and get
       the same print resolution as traditional 2D printers? Why not print
       those single-use cups and plates for the family party, but with a
       picture of the birthday-boy/girl on them? It could all be printed
       in renewable corn-based PLA plastic.
       For now, 3D printers will be used by the DIY crowd (much like
       sowing machines), but that can change quickly.
     * B
       3D artists do all of this already. The problem is we are a society
       of consumers entering ill-prepared the age of personal
       manufacturing. Design literacy will be as necessary in the near
       future as computer literacy is today.
