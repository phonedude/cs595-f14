   Middle of the milken global conference.
   So much talk about disruption.
   What does it mean to you?
   We live in amazing times because technology is constantly getting the
   work cost and easier to use.
   All of these great inventions keep happening from amazing innovators
   and we call them disruptions.
   Everyone is so excited.
   Shouldn't we drill down and look at the best products, best technology?
   Right now, at least for those of us in new york, it seems like all of
   the geniuses are in silicon valley.
   Rex it is a little overdone.
   There has been innovation in silicon valley and have to look at those
   things together.
   Not just the technology and inventions and the new ideas but the great
   visionary leaders have, long to create the industry.
   You have to give them credit for what has happened.
   When people look at your success story, how would you define how you
   did it in one word?
   The product, the hostile -- hustle, passion?
   Having a beginner's mind and everything i do and meet and every new
   invention that comes along.
   I always try to clear my mind to the ideas i have had before that . god
   bless you.
   I make sure my mind is clear, that i can have a beginner's mind.
   That is the most important thing to be successful today.
   How do you really do that?
   When you are starting out, i understand how you can have a clear mind.
   At this point, you working on the hill.
   How do you make the right decision.
   You cannot take on that energy.
   You have to separate your self.
   That might be a reality but does not need to be internal reality.
   Your internal reality needs to be you have a beginner's mind.
   Thinking to your self, what do i want now?
   How will i get it now?
   What is keeping me from achieving this now?
   Step back, clear your mind and say, now based on everything that is
   happening, what should i do now to be successful?
   When you look at fortune 500 ceos right now hiding under the covers am
   awaiting for dan loeb, bill ackman to come knocking, what is your
   advice to them?
   This is the time you had to be more collaborative, bring in the board
   of directors and bring in management team and be more of all and open
   up more.
   I am part of the team here.
   Together we can do it.
   We can come up with the right idea and bring forth new products.
   The ceos know that.
   The ones that are by themselves know that.
   Your analogy is a great one because they are by themselves undercover.
   The want to embrace the teams for will be successful.
   Are there ceos that you look to and say he is doing it right?
   There are many.
   I have a lot of role models.
   Jeffrey immelt is a phenomenal ceo.
   I think he is completely reconceptualized.
   He has revealed not just the technology models but fundamental business
   models.
   At that size and scale to do that come i think is all inspiring.
   When i think about philanthropy and real estate, is one of your goals
   to change the definition of capitalism?
   We do need more compassionate capitalism.
   It is probably best said by milton friedman when he said this is
   business, make rockets complement -- constantly optimizing.
   It is not about constantly optimizing.
   If we are constantly optimizing, everyone gets distracted.
   The reality is we need to include more people than ever before.
   Gets back to my idea of collaborative.
   Then do you get to too many people at the table?
   It back.
   The generous of heart.
   Be more compassionate.
   Share more with others.
   It will only make you happier.
   You can do that as a ceo and be successful.
   How have you ingrained that and the culprit culture of what you have
   created because philanthropy is part of what you do in every aspect of
   your life come and that is different from the leaders in the past?
   Enqueue you for asking me that question.
   With the one percent of equity and one percent of profit into a 5013c
   nonprofit.
   It was very easy because we have no profit, no people.
   But the reality is we have been able to get around -- away huge amounts
   of volunteerism.
   20,000 nonprofits.
   Given away tens of millions of dollars in grants all over the world.
   It is really just knowing that was our intention.
   We did not just wants a new technology model.
   We did that.
   We created a new business model.
   Pay-as-you-go software.
   We created a new pay-as-you-go model as well.
   Lots of new companies on board with this model.
   What is your proudest achievement?
   I think it is the ability to give back.
   And to make sure our employees are having that experience.
   They say here is the cubicle, kitchen, toilet.
   We say here is the soup kitchen down the street.
   On the first day we take all of our employees and set them up for
   volunteering event.
   We have done that from day one.
   We want to let them know we are a special company.
   We create great products, great industries.
   We innovate in amazing and magical ways but we are also giving back.
   That was stephanie ruhle talking to a truly inspirational salesforce
   founder and ceo marc benioff at the milken conference.
   Shares of twitter down 10% of the earthlink -- after the earnings
   report showed user growth slowed down.
