What Happens to #Ferguson Affects Ferguson:

Net Neutrality, Algorithmic Filtering and Ferguson
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ferguson is about many things, starting first with race and policing in
   America.

   But it’s also about internet, net neutrality and algorithmic filtering.

   It’s a clear example of why “saving the Internet”, as it often phrased,
   is not an abstract issue of concern only to nerds, Silicon Valley
   bosses, and few NGOs. It’s why “algorithmic filtering” is not a vague
   concern.

   It’s a clear example why net neutrality is a human rights issue; a free
   speech issue; and an issue of the voiceless being heard, on their own
   terms.

   I saw this play out in multiple countries — my home country of Turkey
   included — but last night, it became even more heartbreakingly apparent
   in the United States as well.

   For me, last night’s Ferguson “coverage” began when people started
   retweeting pictures of armored vehicles with heavily armored “robocops”
   on top of them, aiming their muzzle at the protesters, who seemed to
   number a few hundred. It was the fourth night after an unarmed black
   man, Michael Brown, was shot by a — still unnamed — police officer
   after a “jaywalking” incident. Witnesses say he died hands in the air,
   saying “don’t shoot”.

   The first night Mike Brown was shot, a friend asked on Twitter whether
   this would ever make the national news. It deserved to be national news
   as multiple significant, ongoing crises intersect at Ferguson: the loss
   of jobs which hit these communities worst; the militarization of US
   police departments; race; chronic multi-generational poverty.

   But those very factors often make it less likely such places make the
   news, except as trouble spots. Places to be ignored. Avoided. “We” hear
   it only through official statements, often dismissing local concerns,
   painting them as looters, thugs, troublemakers.

   Yes Ferguson will make news, another friend tweeted, because… well,
   here you go: Twitter.

   It seems like a world ago in which such places, and such incidents,
   would be buried in silence, though, of course, residents knew of their
   own ignored plight. Now, we expect documentation, live-feeds, streaming
   video, real time Tweets.

   I watched this interaction online. When local the police department in
   Ferguson showed up at the first vigils for this young man with dogs,
   the outrage spilled over to people who may not have been following it
   the first day. When night after night, reports of tear gas came in,
   more national journalists went to the area, as well as more residents
   turning on their cameras, deliberately. More and more people started
   talking about this.

   Yesterday, national journalists were harassed, assaulted,
   arrested — without paperwork — while sitting quietly, recharging their
   phones at McDonald's — captured on video. Police positioned like
   snipers on top of armored, anti-mine vehicles kept their rifles — I
   have no idea what kind — aimed at protester within full view of
   national media, in broad daylight — pictured from multiple angles.

   This unfolded in real time on my social media feed which was pretty
   soon taken over by the topic — and yes, it’s a function of who I follow
   but I follow across the political spectrum, on purpose, and also
   globally. Egyptians and Turks were tweeting tear gas advice.
   Journalists with national profiles started going live on TV. And yes,
   there were people from the left and the right who expressed outrage.

   I write and talk often about protest over-policing in multiple
   countries, so the topic was not a new one to me but I saw many people
   who I know don’t necessarily follow this day-to-day (and don’t
   condemn — not everyone can, or should, follow every worthy issue) start
   talking about it.

   And this is what happened to “Ferguson” on Twitter:

   And then I switched to non net-neutral Internet to see what was up. I
   mostly have a similar a composition of friends on Facebook as I do on
   Twitter.

   Nada, zip, nada.

   No Ferguson on Facebook last night. I scrolled. Refreshed.

   I was not the only one who noticed this. Others remarked as well:

   This morning, though, my Facebook feed is also very heavily dominated
   by discussion of Ferguson. Many of those posts seem to have been
   written last night, but I didn’t see them then. Overnight, “edgerank”
   –or whatever Facebook’s filtering algorithm is called now — seems to
   have bubbled them up, probably as people engaged them more.

   But I wonder: what if Ferguson had started to bubble, but there was no
   Twitter to catch on nationally? Would it ever make it through the
   algorithmic filtering on Facebook? Maybe, but with no transparency to
   the decisions, I cannot be sure.

   Would Ferguson be buried in algorithmic censorship?

   Would we even have a chance to see her?

   This isn’t about Facebook per se—maybe it will do a good job, maybe
   not—but the fact that algorithmic filtering, as a layer, controls what
   you see on the Internet. Net neutrality (or lack thereof) will be yet
   another layer determining this. This will come on top of existing
   inequalities in attention, coverage and control.

   Twitter was also affected by algorithmic filtering. “Ferguson” did not
   trend in the US on Twitter but it did trend locally. [I’ve since
   learned from @gilgul that that it *briefly* trended but mostly trended
   at localities.] So, there were fewer chances for people not already
   following the news to see it on their “trending” bar. Why? Almost
   certainly because there was already national, simmering discussion for
   many days and Twitter’s trending algorithm (said to be based on a
   method called “term frequency inverse document frequency”) rewards
   spikes… So, as people in localities who had not been talking a lot
   about Ferguson started to mention it, it trended there though the
   national build-up in the last five days penalized Ferguson.

   Algorithms have consequences.

   Mass media, typically, does not do very well covering chronic problems
   of unprivileged populations, poor urban blacks bear the brunt of this,
   but they are not alone. Rural mostly white America, too, is almost
   always ignored except for the occasional “meth labs everywhere” story.
   But yesterday, many outlets were trying, except police didn’t let them.
   Chris Hayes says that police ordered satellite trucks off the area so
   that they could not go live from the area. Washington Post was only one
   outlet whose journalists were arrested — citizen journalists were
   targeted as well.

   On the scrappy live feed kept up by frequently tear-gassed, coughing
   citizen journalists, I heard the announcements calling on them to “turn
   off their cameras.”

   But maybe in the future, they don’t have to bother to arrest
   journalists and force cameras off. In California, legislation is being
   considered for “kill switches” in phones — a feature I honestly cannot
   imagine a good use for this in the United States.

   The citizen journalists held on, even as choked from the gas, some
   traditional media started going live from the region, and today, it’s
   on the front page of many newspapers.

   Maybe, just maybe, there can be a national conversation on these topics
   long-ignored outside these communities. That’s not everything: it may
   be a first step, or it may get drowned out.

   But at least, we are here.

   But I’m not quite sure that without the neutral side of the
   Internet—the livestreams whose “packets” were fast as commercial,
   corporate and moneyed speech that travels on our networks, Twitter
   feeds which are not determined by an opaque corporate algorithms but my
   own choices,—we’d be having this conversation.

   So, I hope that in the coming days, there will be a lot written about
   race in America, about militarization of police departments, lack of
   living wage jobs in large geographic swaths of the country.

   But keep in mind, Ferguson is also a net neutrality issue. It’s also an
   algorithmic filtering issue. How the internet is run, governed and
   filtered is a human rights issue.

   And despite a lot of dismal developments, this fight is far from over,
   and its enemy is cynicism and dismissal of this reality.

   Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.

   What happens to #Ferguson affects what happens to Ferguson.
