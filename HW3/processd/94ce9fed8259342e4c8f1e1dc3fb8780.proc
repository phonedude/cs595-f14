   STORY HIGHLIGHTS
     * Congressman Paul Ryan says America has a problem in culture of
       poverty
     * Eric Liu: Actually, we live in a dysfunctional culture of
       concentrated wealth
     * He says certain antisocial values and behaviors have taken root
       among the rich
     * Liu: The wealthy rigged the political and economic games to amplify
       their gains

   Editor's note: Eric Liu is the founder of Citizen University and the
   author of several books, including "The Gardens of Democracy" and "The
   Accidental Asian." He served as a White House speechwriter and policy
   adviser for President Bill Clinton. Follow him on Twitter @ericpliu.
   The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the
   author.

   (CNN) -- When Congressman Paul Ryan opined recently that there was a
   "real culture problem" in poor communities, "in our inner cities in
   particular," and that this culture was behind some of the country's
   economic troubles, he didn't realize how half right he was.

   People are continuing to debate fiercely what Ryan said and whether he
   meant to propagate racially coded explanations of poverty's roots. But
   put that aside for a moment. Here's what he was right about: There is
   indeed a culture in America that is pathological and now threatens our
   social fabric. It's not the culture of poverty, though. It's the
   culture of wealth.

   We live in an age of extreme concentration of wealth in America. The
   problem is not just that the 1% have managed to nearly triple their
   share of national income in the last three decades. Nor is it just that
   the 1% increasingly are fed, schooled and housed in a bubble apart from
   the rest of their fellow citizens.
   Eric Liu

   The problem is that today's concentration of wealth is breaking the
   golden link that Ryan and others take pains to emphasize -- the link
   between work and reward.

   Economist Thomas Piketty's landmark new book "Capital" unpacks this
   delinking in great statistical detail. It turns out that increasing
   numbers of Americans in the 1%, .1% and .01% have done little to "earn"
   their wealth or privilege.

   Contrary to myth, most of today's plutocrats are not the kind of Steve
   Jobsian visionary risk-taking entrepreneurs or superstar celebrities.
   The .01%, for instance, tend overwhelmingly to be high-end corporate
   managers and executives, particularly on Wall Street, operating in
   interlocking networks that inflate the standard of what an executive is
   "worth." Or they are the heirs of the great entrepreneurs (4 of the 10
   richest Americans are children of Sam Walton), inheritors of fortunes
   of which it can truly be said, "someone else built that."

   An aristocracy is emerging in America, a class of insiders that
   corrodes the promise of equal citizenship. And with this compounding of
   unearned advantage, certain antisocial values and behaviors have taken
   root among the superrich -- norms that threaten to corrupt the rest of
   American society.

   Is 'Gatsby' creating global inequality?
   Obama: Pay inequality's an embarrassment
   Is Google to blame for the income gap?

   What's in this dysfunctional culture of concentrated wealth? Look
   around Wall Street. You'll find tribal insularity, short-term thinking,
   personal irresponsibility, cynicism about playing by the rules, an
   aversion to socially productive labor, a habit of shameless
   materialism, an inability to defer gratification and a lack of concern
   for what "message" all this sends to the youth raised in such an
   environment.

   In short, you'll find the very things typically imputed to the culture
   of poverty.

   Now, to be sure, there are poor people who do exhibit these antisocial
   values and norms. And there is no question that plenty of poor people
   are poor because they made bad choices and behaved in self-destructive
   ways.

   But rich people who exhibit such values have something the poor don't:
   Money. Money buys exemption from bad choices. Money confers power -- in
   particular, over the poor. It confers the power to frame public
   narrative and policymaking and to determine whose behavior -- whose
   culture -- is (and isn't) called pathological.

   Today, as it was during the last Gilded Age, the concentration of
   wealth gives the rich the political clout to further concentrate their
   wealth. (And now, as then, the Supreme Court greases the skids in the
   name of "liberty"). This clout is wielded in plain sight now, without
   any pretense of civic equality. And it calls to mind the warning
   attributed to Justice Louis Brandeis: "We may have democracy, or we may
   have wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can't have
   both."

   When the richest 400 families in America have more wealth than the
   bottom 155 million Americans combined, the danger to the republic is
   far more clear and present than that posed by the "welfare queens" of
   lore or by anecdotes of shiftless inner-city men.

   That would be true even if the super-rich today had entirely benign or
   merely neutral policy preferences. But in fact they've rigged the game
   of policy, subsidies and tax preferences to amplify and hoard their
   gains.

   This isn't to suggest that all super-wealthy people are "welfare kings"
   (they're not) or to imply that they have a monopoly on selfishness or
   sociopathic attitudes (they don't). Yet if it's unfair to paint
   everyone in the 1% with the same unflattering brush of "dysfunctional
   culture," isn't it far worse to do the same to the poorest 20%?

   Wealth and advantage are as strongly self-reinforcing as poverty and
   disadvantage. It's possible to recognize this fact while also
   championing grit, gumption and good values. In fact, it's essential.
   But culture doesn't explain everything. And where it matters isn't only
   among the poor or nonwhite.

   If we're going to reform the norms in this country so that opportunity
   is truly reflective of effort and talent, we have to do more than pick
   on those with the least. We have to start at the top.
