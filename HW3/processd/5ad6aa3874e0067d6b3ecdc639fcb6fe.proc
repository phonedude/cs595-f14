Ball Don't Lie

Warriors coach Mark Jackson dominates Stephen Curry in a three-point shooting
contest (Video)

   Mark Jackson calls off Stephen Curry. (Getty Images)

   Mark Jackson was not a good three-point shooter. In fact, until my
   editors alerted me about this video clip, I was of the understanding
   that I would not have to witness Jackson’s ugly push-shot ever again,
   unless I happened upon an old Indiana Pacers game on NBA TV, and
   someone decided to double-team Rik Smits.

   (And the shot clock was winding down.)

   (And Reggie Miller was on the bench.)

   Because that’s the only time you’d want to see Jackson chuck it, a 33
   percent career three-point shooter who spent the prime of his shooting
   years working with a 22-foot three-point arc from 1994 until 1997.

   So when the current Golden State Warriors coach was paired up with
   Stephen Curry – well on his way toward becoming one of the greatest
   shooters in NBA history with his career 44 percent mark from long range
   – in a shooting contest? It doesn’t seem fair, especially for a
   pass-first guard like Jackson that hasn’t played an NBA game in a
   decade.

   And yet, after a spirited Warriors practice in Indianapolis on Monday,
   the old man went to work:

   (The best part about this clip? This is at Bankers Life Fieldhouse’s
   practice court, which is visible to any passer-by that would want to
   take a gander at an NBA practice from the street outside.)

   Jackson does have a bit of an advantage, here, as he worked on this
   particular practice court for two seasons following the opening of the
   then-Conseco Fieldhouse in 1998. The veteran didn’t exactly spend his
   post-practice hours firing up 500 practice jumpers a day, that ship had
   long since sailed, but we’re sure the sightlines are more than familiar
   to him.

   A fantastic showing from the Warriors coach, though, regardless of
   (ex)-home court advantage. Not bad, for a prolific passer that was
   never supposed to shoot that much, in the weeks leading up to his 49th
   birthday.
