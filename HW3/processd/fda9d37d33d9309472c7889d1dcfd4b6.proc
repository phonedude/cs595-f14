online education and the desperate need for educational realism

   1 February 2014EducationFreddie

   It’s not uncommon for politics and policy to be distorted by a romantic
   vision of human nature, but nowhere is that more true than education.

   Here at Purdue, we have a strong freshman composition program,
   Introductory Composition at Purdue (ICAP). One of the reasons for its
   strength, in my opinion, is our  conference system. English 106, the
   largest ICAP course, is a five-day-a-week teaching commitment. All
   students meet with their ICAP instructor in a one-on-one or small group
   conferencing sessions every week. As you can imagine, having to teach
   every weekday is not a thrilling prospect for many of our TAs. Despite
   what most people think, teaching a college class is a major time
   commitment; lesson planning and preparation for in-class activities is
   an even bigger time commitment than grading, which is a bear itself.
   The conferencing requirement also has major cost implications for the
   university; because the course meets so often, it carries a higher
   credit load, meaning that our TAs typically teach only two sections a
   year, rather than the one/two schedule typical of graduate students.
   Multiply that across hundreds of sections of the course. It’s a major
   commitment.

   Why make it? I wasn’t sure I knew the answer to that myself, when I
   first came to Purdue. I remember being surprised that a college class
   met every day. It was just so far out of the norm. After just one
   semester of teaching ICAP, my feelings had changed entirely: I was now
   worried about a possible future of teaching freshman composition at
   other universities where I wouldn’t have one-on-one conferencing with
   students worked into the schedule. Because there, more than in our
   regular classroom, computer lab, or online course site, was where the
   actual educating happened. It was in those very small groups, where I
   could give the individual students individual attention, that I was
   able to go through their work with them line-by-line and show them
   where and how they could improve their writing. I’ve tried all number
   of ways to do that outside of class meetings– marking papers
   extensively, using Track Changes, real-time online collaboration– and
   it never, ever works. Most them don’t look, and most of them don’t
   care, unless there’s the basic human accountability of sitting down
   with them at a table and going through the changes together. That’s how
   I drag them to the skills they want.

   I will have lost some of you with that verb. “Drag them! How
   presumptuous! That’s so insulting.” I assure you: no, it’s not. No,
   it’s not insulting to use the word “drag” to describe educating
   undergraduates. I promise you it’s not. Of course, there are in most
   classes one or two or three students who are both very bright and
   self-motivated. They’re wonderful to work with. But most students
   require a frankly endless amount of pushing, pulling, cajoling,
   motivating, and yes, dragging to competence. Some actively resist. I’m
   not complaining: this is what I love to do, and it’s why they pay me. I
   signed up to be a compositionist knowing that many, both within and
   outside of the university, see nothing to respect in the discipline. I
   did because I love teaching people to write and love researching ways
   to do it better. I’m just relaying reality, in context with an
   education media that simply doesn’t want to hear it: our college
   students are not an army of young autodidacts who are pursuing
   knowledge out of a love for learning. They just aren’t. They’re here,
   in very large measure, to collect a degree that they identify as being
   a largely or purely economic instrument. Who could blame them? That’s
   what their culture is telling them education is for: making money. So
   they proceed rationally from that premise.

   So you work, and you work, and you work, and you sit with them in
   conferencing and you revise their papers again and again and you chase
   them down when they don’t submit by deadline and you make your
   instructions explicit again and again and you hope that they’ll bother
   to come back to class after spring break and you work, work, work to
   get them to a reasonable level of ability. And then when you give them
   a B+ they write outraged emails to the dean about what a horrible
   injustice that is. But of course they do. Again, it’s natural: their
   culture teaches them that everyone is equally capable of everything,
   and that any problems in education are necessarily the fault of
   educators and not of students, so they rage when they get a grade that
   is commensurate with their work. They’re a product of their culture.

   Again: I love teaching. I love my students. I’m not trying to insult
   them, at all. I’m trying, instead, to speak honestly about them in
   their actual, real-world humanity. And trust me: my  students here at
   Purdue are not unusually unmotivated or unintelligent. Just the
   opposite; they’re remarkably bright, attending a competitive public
   research university, in a period where getting into good colleges has
   never been harder or more competitive. Yes, they’re a restricted range.
   They’re restricted near the top, not the bottom. Still, it’s a struggle
   to educate them. I’m just trying to be honest with you.

   So maybe you can see why I am so deeply frustrated with the Clay Shirky
   vision, which is really just the consensus view, and pretty much
   Obama’s major vision for the next era of the American economy. It’s a
   common saw: the next stage of American abundance requires all of our
   workers be educated, it’s too expensive to teach them in the
   conventional academic setting, and so we need to replace the physical
   university with online colleges, staffed by adjuncts teaching many
   sections of huge classes. And not only will we be erasing the very
   notion of individual instructor attention, we’ll be particularly
   targeting the most vulnerable, most difficult to educate students, the
   ones who now either never make it to college or drop out at huge rates.
   This is the perfect expression of an educational discourse that has no
   connection to the reality of what most schooling is like for most
   students.

   At my MA institution, the University of Rhode Island, there’s a great
   program called Talent Development. It’s a program for minority students
   from urban parts of Rhode Island; they’re offered admission into the
   school on a probationary basis, with the requirement that they undergo
   a summer program before their freshman year and maintain an additional
   accountability and support program for their first two. Such programs
   are an essential part of the academy’s mission; they are a moral
   necessity. And the program does enjoy some success: TD students have
   better outcomes than other students from similar backgrounds. But
   notice that the Talent Development program works by doing precisely
   the opposite of what Shirky sees as the future of education. They’re
   not reducing face-to-face time; they’re increasing it. They’re not
   reducing individual instruction and attention; they’re increasing it.
   And even so, while the TD students do better than other students from
   similar circumstances, my understanding is that they still on the whole
   do significantly worse than the median URI student.

   Because educating “nontraditional” students– administrator speak for
   poor students, students whose parents are themselves uneducated,
   minority students, and students who struggled in high school– is really
   hard. Look, I don’t doubt that the American university system has
   failed these students in any number of ways. I could go on at length
   about those failures. But at some point you have to actually grapple
   with reality, which is that for a complex and controversial set of
   reasons, some people are harder to educate. Not everyone is equally
   capable of educational success. They just aren’t. I’m dedicated to the
   task as getting as many marginal students in and through as possible,
   and I think that’s an absolute moral need for our colleges and our
   society. But it’s not going to work for everyone, and it’s going to
   take great efforts, and online models are precisely the opposite of
   what’s likely to work.

   We’ll be debating the causes of that inequality for the rest of my
   life, with liberals asserting that it’s the product of unequal
   circumstances and systemic  forces, and conservatives asserting that
   it’s the product of natural talent and work ethic. But at a certain
   point, the reason becomes irrelevant; by the time they reach adulthood,
   people  just are unequal, and we have reams and reams of empirical
   research that demonstrates that. The refusal to grapple with that
   reality will prove ruinous to the long term economic justice of the
   United States, as people like Shirky and Arne Duncan and President
   Obama articulate a vision of education as a great equalizer that denies
   the reality of unequal ability.

   Andrew Sullivan linked to Shirky’s piece by saying that Shirky “wants
   the academic world to face reality.” Well, I think it’s Shirky and
   those like him who need to get real. Efforts to change the long-term
   economic futures of vast social classes through education are the de
   facto answer to poverty and inequality among the Davos set, despite the
   fact that education has never been proven to be equal to that task, as
   people like Matt Bruenig keep pointing out. We are risking the future
   on a vision that, it seems to me, has no justifiable grounding in
   either experience or empiricism. Pleasant lies about everyone’s ability
   to succeed in college, particularly in a new kind of college where by
   design individual students receive far less attention, are politically
   pleasing but practically destructive.

   I’m not teaching freshmen now, but rather grad students. It’s a lovely
   experience. And I think it’s what most people think most college
   teaching is like: working with self-motivated, committed students. But
   there’s a reason why grad students are rare, and without judgment, I’m
   telling you that most undergrads simply are not like my grad students.
   They just aren’t. Fooling ourselves that they are is a huge mistake.

   Although my readership is quite modest, I have still enjoyed more
   attention, in online politics, than I ever expected to get. I have been
   making some version of this argument for a long time. I have never been
   able to get even minimal purchase with this argument. People not only
   don’t agree about it, but just don’t engage. The Atlantic has an entire
   education “channel,” but you could go weeks there without reading a
   word of genuine educational pessimism. This is par for the course.

   The rhetorical mechanism through which this kind of argument is
   dismissed is ostensibly liberal– you’re saying that people can’t learn!
   You’re saying that people are unequal! But I’m not saying that people
   can’t learn. I’m saying that not everyone can learn the same things,
   and shouldn’t be expected to, but the dictates of “the economy of
   tomorrow” dramatically narrows the horizons of what education can try
   and do. And I’m not saying that people are unequal in their rights,
   their dignity, or their inherent value. But I am saying that people are
   deeply unequal in their ability to satisfy certain educational demands
   which, again, are dictated by the same people who are calling for an
   economy based on everyone selling smartphone apps. And I am saying that
   whatever the complicated reasons for that fact, it is a fact, and one
   that most people actually believe even as they deny it publicly.

   The people pushing this vision, tellingly, are almost exclusively
   people who have little to no connection to the day-to-day work of
   educating undergraduates in basic skills. Either the people arguing for
   this are journalists and pundits who have never educated, or they are
   deans and administrators who haven’t taught undergrads in 20 years, or
   they are celebrity intellectuals who barely teach and when they do,
   teach at elite institutions where only the most equipped to succeed are
   present. The greatest division in educational discourse today is not
   best understood as progressive vs. neoliberal or something similar. The
   greatest division, at all levels of education, is between those in the
   world of media and policy who assert that we have the ability to make
   miracles happen, and the educators who are actually out there,
   day-to-day, trying to get students to standards those students cannot
   meet. We can begin to let our policy discussions reflect on what’s
   actually happening in our actual schools, or we can continue to engage
   in pleasant fantasy. We can build a vast edifice of online higher
   education where, as happens with for-profit online schools now, we all
   agree to juke the stats, grading and graduating students who lack even
   basic skills, and degrading the very notion of higher education. That’s
   an option.

   The other option is far more direct, has a far better history, and a
   far better moral outcome: give people money. Redistribute. Institute
   some sort of guaranteed minimum income. Unlike large-scale educational
   reform, giving people money has a great track record for changing their
   material conditions. Social Security is one of the most wildly
   successful anti-poverty programs in history. They just cut checks.
   Extend those benefits to all Americans, paid for through steeply
   progressive tax rates, and eliminate the massive bureaucracy through
   which we now deliver our arbitrary and inadequate safety net. The
   positive effects on educational outcomes are likely to be massive.
   Freed from the need to secure their immediate material survival, many
   people will choose to go to school for subjects that they actually want
   to study. Many others will opt not to go to college, rather than
   pursuing a degree despite a lack of interest and prerequisite skills,
   which will be better for them and better for the colleges. I think a
   guaranteed minimum income would result in an incredible flowering of
   human productivity, and incidentally a great outburst in small
   businesses, which should make conservatives happy. But even if the
   results are more modest, they will be far better at eliminating poverty
   and human misery than hoping against experience that we can give
   everyone a quality college education, and that such an education would
   be a ticket to the good life.

   I am a socialist precisely because I know that, whatever the causes,
   human beings end up substantially different in their abilities, and
   good people are denied access to a good life because what they are good
   at is not what the labor market wants to pay for. I believe in equality
   of human value, but I do not believe in equality of human ability. So I
   want to force a minimal level of equality in material security and
   comfort with a simple mechanism that works.

   There’s a chance. I’m pessimistic. There’s too much money in the other
   vision, too many profiteers and too many people making careers as
   iconoclasts, selling unproven, fanciful visions of the next stage of
   our economy. We are likely to institute this plan or something like it,
   and then watch as it fails, and then resist, resist, resist the reality
   that it’s not working, until finally it’s become too obvious to ignore.
   Then, maybe, we’ll get real about redistribution. The question is, how
   much preventable failure and unhappiness will we generate in the
   meantime?

       For the college bound high achiever, the intensive one-one-one
       instruction you describe is an invisible privilege. They get it in
       school because they get the best teachers, because those teachers
       have the calmest classes, and because those courses operate under
       the heavy grade inflation that guarantees close attention to avoid
       embarrassment from the external evaluations such as AP exams and
       college admissions. They get it in their social interactions, and
       though that isn’t always what we might call ethical help it is
       highly personal. And they get it at home, again in a blend of the
       supportive and abusive but definitely still intensive personal and
       direct. It is clear that such networks are critical for what we
       view as the independent, self motivated college student, and it is
       clear that everybody concerned from this end is well aware that
       very few kids go off to Purdue, at least from my high school (three
       last year), in any way prepared to live that imaginary standard.
       That is why I share your contempt for these online models.

       Without doing some detailed side-by-side analysis of Shirky’s piece
       with your response – not easily done in a comments venue – I’m not
       convinced (having read this now, and scanning Shirky’s having read
       it closely days ago) that you’ve really engaged Shirky’s argument.
       First, I read Shirky as responding to a multi-tiered educational
       system. Would you argue that higher education in the US is not
       multi-tiered? Shirky doesn’t dismiss your institution, your
       students, you, or your premise about the bricks and mortar edifice
       that houses it all. Rather he argues that’s not all higher
       education in the US is.
       Secondly, he shares your awareness of the imbeddedness of students
       in the culture that causes them to seek a higher education.
       Above and beyond that, he also takes a turn at the effects shifts
       have had on faculty staffing patterns. Nice that your students have
       the luxury of these small group, close feedback coaching sessions
       (though some intellectual athletes be less willing/able than
       others). But, that isn’t available in many higher ed settings.
       [And, fwiw, I share your experience of sometimes needing to "drag"
       students to acquire the skills they ostensibly came to acquire.
       Imo, to do less is to fail to respect them; a sidebar discussion.]
       And, of course, these staffing patterns vary widely depending on
       the tier you examine.
       All that said, Shirkey’s working from a premise that is
       fundamentally different than yours; His: the Golden Age isn’t
       coming back vs Yours: The Golden Age wasn’t even golden. His
       premise addresses the tenured faculty. Yours, the policy makers
       (tax payers/avoiders). His is what he sees out his window right
       now. Yours, to what could be, but isn’t [Particularly, having
       looked at your comment there and his response to it.]
       While I might agree that your vision for higher education is
       desirable, I don’t disagree with Shirky that – at least in the near
       term – that ain’t the direction in which the economic forces are
       pulling higher education. The thrust of Shirky’s piece is, given
       the direction of these forces where yours seems to be, let’s
       redirect the forces. You can be frustrated with what you claim is
       Shirky’s “vision,” but would you deny the view Shirky sees out his
       window? No, obviously, you don’t. But, you can’t simply dismiss the
       effects of “credentialing” by arguing that students are inherently
       unequal in their abilities. That is a whole different discussion.

            In a sense, I think you’re perfectly right: he’s making a
            typical academic argument in describing a change that he
            abdicates any responsibility for– one which, we should be
            clear, will leave many worse off, but not him (the boys in
            Davos love his work)– and I am making a political argument,
            that the change which he merely describes is a ruinous
            direction not just for higher education but for our country,
            and one which will leave both far worse off in the long run.
            He is describing a change in which he has no great personal
            stake. I am opposing that change out of both personal and
            societal need. Which one of these you value more is a matter
            for you and your conscience.

                 personal stake.
                 I guess that’s not how I read him, particularly, given
                 that he seems to be suggesting that the tenured faculty
                 (of which, I understand he is one?) are going to have to
                 forfeit a myth that – at least – underpins their sense of
                 professional (and, maybe social/economic) worth.
                 I am opposing that change out of both personal and
                 societal need. Which one of these you value more is a
                 matter for you and your conscience.
                 I perceive a sneering quality to this which I’m not sure
                 I deserved.
                 To be clear (more clear?), I read Shirky as promoting a
                 kind of triage for a system that is failing.

     The number of high-school graduates underserved or unserved by
     higher education today dwarfs the number of people for whom that
     system works well. The reason to bet on the spread of large-scale
     low-cost education isn’t the increased supply of new technologies.
     It’s the massive demand for education, which our existing
     institutions are increasingly unable to handle. That demand will go
     somewhere.
                 Re; that demand. Since you have a grasp of the context,
                 one of the places I would hate to see that demand go is
                 increasingly to a for-profit “vocational” entity for
                 which students can acquire substantial debt, and for
                 which no substantial number of jobs exist…if the student
                 completes.
                 What I “hear” Shirky calling for is precisely this:

     Those of us in the traditional academy could have a hand in shaping
     that future, but doing so will require us to relax our obsessive
     focus on elite students, institutions, and faculty. It will require
     us to stop regarding ourselves as irreplaceable occupiers of sacred
     roles, and start regarding ourselves as people who do several jobs
     society needs done, only one of which is creating new knowledge.
                 With an emphasis on a hand in shaping. And, the only way
                 he seems to see that happening is if that “elite”-serving
                 faculty picks their gaze off the toes of their own shoes
                 and stops waiting to the situation to “right” itself.
                 Because, as you note, you’re arguing against:

     the consensus view, and pretty much Obama’s major vision for the
     next era of the American economy
                 Hard to know where it all lands if the academy chooses to
                 involve itself. They might even fashion a “tourniquet”
                 which would put the system in a damned better place to
                 move in the direction you’d choose than if they simply
                 let the “consensus view” take its course unimpeded.

                      I didn’t intend to sneer, and I apologize if I came
                      across that way.
                      Maybe your take is fairer and more sensible than
                      mine. It may be. All I know is this: so much of our
                      educational conversation is predicated on the
                      assumption that we can achieve types of gains for
                      broad groups that we have very limited evidence are
                      possible. And this is directly tied to a for-profit
                      industry that is eager to siphon money off of
                      vulnerable students. My interest, not merely for
                      higher education but for education writ large, is to
                      ground our investigations in a harsher, but
                      ultimately better, vision of education: not merely
                      to ask why Head Start fails or why No Child Left
                      Behind fails, but to ask what those failures say
                      about our general assumptions about what education
                      does, what it can do, and what it’s for.

                      There’s no “triage” in Shirky’s vision. There is
                      only the jettisoning of the most vulnerable to a
                      mass-produced digital product he calls “education”
                      but most of us would recognize as “education-related
                      product.”
                      I’d be shocked if Shirky has any firsthand
                      experience with the kind of education Freddie
                      describes in this post or what most of us spend our
                      time doing with our students. As someone who has
                      taught undergraduates exclusively for better than a
                      decade, I can honestly say that I recognize almost
                      nothing of what he writes about.
                      He views education through the lens of a
                      credentialing marketplace, rather than a process
                      through which people might actually learn things.

       Why do you say “minority students” instead of “students of color”?
       Will you move from one to the other as soon as Hispanic students
       make up a plurality of the population?

            Either way. Perhaps because “minority students” is the phrase
            that is conventionally used by the administrations of many
            universities, and within a lot of the extant literature on
            these topics.

                 going along with standard practice (all the while

       In Claude Steele’s Whistling Vivaldi: How Stereotypes Affect Us and
       What We Can Do, he makes the point that African American students
       spend much, much more time on their studies than other groups while
       producing worse outcomes. He marshalls significant social science
       work to describe the idea of stereotype threat or negative
       performance bias that causes members of a group to perform worse
       because they have been told they will perform worse. If you accept
       his argument, expecting excellent performance from members of any
       group where there is wide spread belief that they will perform
       poorly is basically impossible (or at best very difficult to
       achieve). One of his proposed remedies is more direct attention
       from professors.

            I think that there is real work that can be done which can
            have real impacts on the problem you describe. But it’s
            another case where I think the economic and moral logic of a
            guaranteed minimum income or similar mechanism is clear: the
            way that black people are conditioned to believe in their own
            propensity for failure has to stem, in large part, from being
            exposed to poverty in vastly disproportionate numbers.

       Thanks, Freddie. I’m not sure what I’m advocating (beyond a
       slightly more charitable view of Shirky) is more fair. Only that my
       own experience as an educator of K-16, in the many, many venues
       (from a impoverished, rural central school, to a research
       institution, to satellite programs appended to a community
       college), and my experience with “elite” students from wealthy
       parents all the way to the economically marginalized, suggests that
       if the Golden Age isn’t coming back, then I’m not sure why the
       elite educational (socio-economic) opportunity afforded to some has
       to come at everyone else’s expense (because that demand will go
       somewhere). I don’t think that’s what you’re suggesting should
       happen, but I see that as a natural outcome if that faculty
       Shirky’s addressing doesn’t get involved. And, who knows? Getting
       that faculty involved could cut both ways; codifying the elite
       opportunity or expanding educational opportunity.
       John Warner, I’m tempted to tell you to go …. whatever.
       Credentialing is part of what we do. It’s the nasty, undeniable,
       underbelly of what we do. Go ahead. Make the argument that a
       professional graduate education isn’t a union card, and an
       undergrad education isn’t angled for that. I want to read it.

            I was imprecise in my phrasing. Credentialing is obviously a
            byproduct of our educational system. Without it, many fewer
            people would be interested in following through with their
            educations, as evidenced by the terrible completion rate of
            MOOCs without credentials attached.
            What I meant to say is that Shirky treats it as if it’s the
            only>/i> function of education.
            When you say the “demand has to go somewhere,” I wonder what
            you’re seeing as the demand. The demand isn’t for education,
            per se, it’s for what they believe education can provide: a
            secure, stable life. The credential of education is obviously
            part of that (the ticket through the door, if you will) but
            it’s the process of being educated that has a far bigger
            impact on one’s life trajectory. The most important part of
            the “traditional” educational experience is in the people you
            meet while experiencing education. The social capital earned
            is far more important to the lives that graduates will
            ultimately lead than the credential itself. I went to graduate
            school because the one undergraduate professor who knew my
            name paved the way for my admittance. Even college dropout
            Mark Zuckerberg might not have made it without the good
            fortune of being placed with roommates who could help fund his
            idea that became Facebook. I imagine just about anyone who has
            experienced “traditional” education has similar experiences
            that have fundamentally changed their fortunes.
            Once people realize that education-related-product has very
            little actual value because it is divorced from this other
            part of education, no more demand. I believe this is why many
            people continue to make major sacrifices in order to pay for
            the “traditional” experience. They know it’s not just the
            degree that matters.
            Look at some of the shadier operators in the for-profit
            industry that promise credentials but can’t deliver the social
            capital. IMO, that’s the future if we follow Shirky’s vision.
            I’ll also say that in my experience, faculty is very involved
            in addressing these questions, and getting more involved all
            the time. They’ve been slow to react, but I see a lot of
            engagement out there.

       Great post.
       I agree with you and Matt Bruenig, but doesn’t that get close to
       arguing for a voucher-ized system, except with a broader basic
       income instead of specific education vouchers? Create a base level
       of beneficial outcomes, and the rest will take care of itself –
       people who want education will get it (or their parents will make
       them get it, as before compulsory public schooling), and those who
       don’t will find other things to do. Why even have public schools
       and public universities if you’ve got a good basic income?

            I may be missing your point, but I don’t think that
            necessarily follows; part of the reason for public
            universities in the first place, and the laws like the Morrill
            Act that led to them, was because there was a paucity of
            universities for students who wanted to attend them even if
            they could pay. If you don’t have the University of North
            Dakota (etc) you don’t have many places to spend that voucher.
            But then again, it doesn’t take much for me to support public
            expenditure for social goods, particularly when you consider
            what a small percentage of the funding for public Us comes
            from states now.

       Not only are Shirky’s prescriptions for the current problems in
       higher education seemingly incorrect in the face of the empirics,
       they are also based on an utterly false a priori assumption: that
       we CANT AFFORD IT. We should be hiring new (qualified) teachers at
       every level of education by the boatload, both to improve the lives
       of instructors but to institute at a mass level the type of
       personal educational experience that Freddie described in his
       writing classes. I have yet to see a measured argument for why our

       Freddie,
       When you are truly serious about this, you’ll come out for
       Guaranteed Income / Choose Your Boss:
       http://www.morganwarstler.com/post/44789487956/guaranteed-income-ch
       oose-your-boss-the-market-based
       You are delivering a big fat dose of reality.
       And the big fat reality of Guaranteed Income is that conservatives
       have a moral notion of fairness based precisely on keeping people
       from taking advantage of charity.
       Now, if you read the plan, you’ll see it delivers the greatest
       amount of personal joy (basically dream jobs for everyone in the
       system) and it preaches entrepreneurism, literally encodes it into
       the lower class.
       Don’t confront only half of reality.
       When you put yourself behind GI/CYB it will move the discussion,
       until then, asking for GI with a solid work requirement is as
       idealist as you accuse neo-liberals of being about education.

                      Now then, if we do Choose Your Boss, that amounts
                      buys at least 30%, probably more like 40% more for
                      the recipient.
                      The consumption of the poor dramatically increases
                      under CYB and thats not something comfy white boys
                      can discount because it isn’t their preference. You
                      need to search your souls here, the goal of the poor
                      is MORE CONSUMPTION, whether that is your goal or
                      not.
                      Note, Choose Your Boss isn’t what you think of a
                      “job requirement”
                      It means the musicians get to be musicians, the

                      I’m asking you to be VERY HONEST.
                      There’s no way GI gets done without a work
                      requirement, BUT my plan confronts reality, and if
                      you’d just think it through, you’ll see – GI/CYB CAN
                      HAPPEN.
                      It can win full support of Occupy Wall Street, the
                      Tea Party and the Congressional Black Caucus.
                      It will DESTROY Fortune 1000 companies, it will

                      GI/CYB CAN HAPPEN.

       Freddie,
       With the immense success Mitch Daniels had with moving the Indiana
       public sector to HSAs, I think you’ll find a strong kindred spirit
       with him on GI/CYB.
       It’s not actually a policy first, it’s a piece of Open Source
       Software, that drives the policy change.
       Most of it is off-the-shelf OSS components: store front, search,
       cred / feedback system, accounting, ACH clearing, etc.
       The idea is once released, people can see it live, see how they can
       show the work they want to do, market themselves. For buyers, it
       forces them to clearly articulate the work they’d like done, see
       who is nearby, make offers to them.
       Code first. Pass waivers for a given state, like Texas or Indiana,
       second.
       The idea is to kickstart the software development using CATO/AEI as
       message sponsors.
       My point is, there’s a Tea Party approved plan, that is far better
       for CBC and OWS – as you surely get – and Mitch Daniels LOVES this
       kind of stuff. And I can hook you up with him.
       Wanna help?

       Thing I’ve often thought: people who believe education can solve
       all social ills believe that because, by and large, education
       worked for them. Presidents, high-ranking officials, executives,
       pundits, public intellectuals: all of these people are
       high-achievers, and most of them were high-achievers in school (or
       at least came from a very privileged background and were only
       exposed to the best education experiences). If you’re a Davos Man
       that, by definition, means that the system worked for you, or
       you’ve only ever been exposed to the best aspects of the system, or
       both.
       So, of course they think education is great! They were one of those
       two or three kids in the composition class who were bright and
       self-motivated. They were probably the best one of that two or
       three. Education worked, for them. These people do not understand
       that, not only do we lack the societal resources to turn everyone
       into a great student and future app developer (or whatever the
       occupation-du-jour happens to be amongst the elites), but that not
       everyone can do that and, arguably more important, not everyone
       wants to do that.

       Been reading your posts for awhile, but this is my first comment.
       As I see it, higher education is basically a great swindle for the
       working class. I mean, I’m to a degree a product of the academy,
       and think there are plenty of reasons why higher education should
       exist as a social good outside of the market. However, we live in a
       market-based system, and it’s frankly a shitty product if the
       primary goal of it is to train the next generation of workers.
       Everything I have read suggests that prior educational (or work
       experience) does little to nothing to how well a worker will
       perform at a task. Most of productivity can be predicted by general
       intelligence (basically IQ) and the personality trait of
       conscientiousness. While the extent to which both traits are
       genetic versus environmental is up for debate, as you point out, by
       the time someone is 18 the malleability of them is pretty much
       done.
       Of course there are still undergraduate degrees which are essential
       as job training, such as engineering. But you cannot help but come
       to the conclusion the vast majority of college degrees amount to
       spending tens of thousands to write five lines on your resume. You
       need those five lines because everyone else you’re competing with
       also has them. And if you get seven lines, you’ll look that much
       better. Even worse, many degrees have directly supplanted the
       earlier job training method of apprenticeship, where the onus was
       on the employer to assure a starting worker would be up to skiff.
       Thus there’s a tremendous, multi-generational concession going on.
       I am confident now this one aspect will collapse in the next few
       decades however. I’ve read an increasing number of articles about
       the use of “big data” to find “people metrics.” Basically this
       tests people’s intelligence and reliability, and makes the social
       signalling of degrees for job training irrelevant. Although it’s
       still in its infancy, it ultimately threatens to make most
       credentialing (except where required by law) irrelevant. Although
       it will lead to a massive reduction of higher education as a side
       effect, what’s left behind will be either things students actually
       are interested in, or which provide real skill training, so it
       can’t be seen as a major loss.

            Of course, there’s every reason to believe that those

            social and cultural biases of the people who generate them,
            leading to an even more retrenched and ossified economy where
            people from the wrong backgrounds are systematically denied
            entry because they perform poorly on those metrics.

                 I agree it may be fraught with its own problems and
                 biases. However, one must think that a job placement
                 system which will stop forcing people to spend massive
                 amounts of money on functionally useless job training is
                 a trade up. And while I’m highly skeptical of meritocracy
                 in general (as I said below), many people would see it a
                 step forward that the lazy, stupid, and somewhat rich
                 wouldn’t have a built in leg up on those who couldn’t
                 afford such prestigious social signaling. And people stop
                 getting jobs just because the interviewer went to the
                 same college =)
                 IMHO though, once you’re dealing with computerized
                 metrics it’s pretty unlikely personal bias will go into
                 intelligence and reliability. The way I understand it
                 works is they look into what traits productive workers
                 have first, and then apply the associations afterwards.
                 That said, there are two big social and cultural biases
                 to begin with – the definition of “productivity” and of
                 “work” itself. But those are inherent to the capitalist
                 system.

       On another note, your main point here edges around something I hate
       with the education fallacy and modern liberalism. Liberals endorse
       meritocracy in principle, they just see the current system as not
       actually being meritocratic. But if we could wave a magic wand
       tomorrow, and make sure the “undeserving rich” and “deserving poor”
       switched places, would the world be more just? I’d say not, given
       there would be a lot of inequality and misery still. If we got rid
       of all environmental reasons that made it so some poor people
       couldn’t succeed, nothing would be left but heredity to determine
       who couldn’t achieve. But what’s fair about consigning people to
       poverty just because they got the genetic short end of the stick?
       Similarly, if you could construct a world where people rose to the
       top solely due to natural talents – why should they be rewarded?
       Either things are literally easier for them because they are
       smarter, and/or they inherited a good work ethic.
       A lot of my other socialist friends get uncomfortable when I talk
       like this. For example, all information I have seen shows that
       upper and upper middle class people on average do have higher IQs
       than working class people (basically, income tracks strongly with
       IQ, but inherited wealth does not). We can argue what degree IQ is
       genetic (although it seems like it mostly is from twin studies). We
       can also argue that it doesn’t accurately measure real
       intelligence. But it correlates quite well with academic and
       financial success, and it’s pretty impervious to positive change as
       an adult.
       The problem is, people seem to jump to the conclusion if you admit
       the average hedge fund manager is smarter than the average janitor
       that you’re implicitly saying that the hedge fund managers are
       better people, and they deserve their ludicrous earnings. They seem
       to think you can only justify socialism if you think the
       benefactors of the capitalist class are all “undeserving,” and
       functionally no smarter than the proles they exploit. IMHO this is
       the disease of liberalism which has infected the left – because
       presumably if you’re actually a socialist, it shouldn’t matter if
       the capitalist class are mainly dullards who lucked into money or
       those who lucked into a talent seeing trends and building
       relationships. The problem is one of control and subjugation, not
       one of deservedness.

            I’m not qualified to weigh in usefully on the topic of IQ. But
            I will happily say that I find the idea of meritocracy
            theoretically incoherent and practically impossible, and I
            wish we would drop it as a concept.
            I mean, the most important point for me is that human life is
            so incredibly multivariate that there is no ability to
            adequately parse whose success is the product of merit and
            whose is the product of chance or advantage. But suppose we
            could. As a friend of mine says, if “natural talent” of
            whatever nature really is intrinsic and unequally distributed,
            then the value capture by that attribute is a rent that should
            be fairly taxed at 100%.

                 I’m glad to see I’m not the only one thinking about the
                 genetic lottery and that sometimes life can be really
                 unfair! At first I was a bit put off by Frederik’s
                 discussion of unequal “abilities”, but all was forgiven
                 once I got to basic income. People are good at different
                 things, and maybe not everyone can be good at something
                 but at least 99% can. (Maybe 1% have severe cognitive
                 impairment that prevents them from living independently.)
                 Within that 99% a lot of them are just bad at school. But
                 a) school is not the same as a job and b) not all jobs
                 are useful to everyone, so why is school so important
                 anyway if it won’t necessarily make you good at a job
                 that might not even be “useful”.
                 Bringing us to basic income. Yay! Go Switzerland! Go
                 Milton Friedman! Just give people money this doesn’t have
                 to be so complicated!

                      Yes, BUT, 99% can ALSO find something they can do
                      that other people will pay, and they can do their
                      bit too…

                      The only way Guaranteed Income gets done is with a
                      work requirement, using GI/CYB we can reaffirm free
                      market choices – but let even the lowest amongst us
                      have dream jobs.

                           Disagree – there is still an incentive to work
                           even if it is not required – provided that
                           people continue to feel incentivized by
                           material wealth (or simply the act of labor,
                           which, in moderation is inherently rewarding).
                           So let’s give people the freedom to do what
                           they want with their lives whether or not they
                           satisfy popular conceptions of ‘work’ or
                           ‘productivity’.

       You could also make the analogy to exercise. Online classes are
       comparable to to home exercise equipment, which is rusting in homes
       across the country. Just like autodidacts, there are a minority who
       will use them regularly. But to get into competitive shape, few
       people can do it without a personal coach. In this case, there is
       also a very broad range of abilities, and those who are in poor
       shape will require more attention.
