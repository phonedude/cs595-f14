   Help me support the Chicago Police Memorial Foundation!

   This past year I reflected on my 5 years as a Chicago Police Officer.
   As many of you know, I was featured in the Sun-Times for an off duty
   incident that went to trial this past
   summer: http://tinyurl.com/n34fy3b

   This reminded me of the dangers Chicago Police Officers face every day
   and the importance of the Chicago Police Memorial Foundation (CPMF).
   The CPMF is a nonprofit 501(c)3 organization dedicated to honoring the
   lives of our fallen heroes by providing support and financial
   assistance to the families of Chicago Police Officers who were killed
   or catastrophically injured in the line of duty.  My family was lucky
   to never need the support of the foundation, but many others have not
   been.

   To support this vital organization, I am participating in the Run to
   Remember, which is a 5k Run/Walk held in memory of the more than 560
   Chicago police officers who have lost their lives in the line of duty.

   Why should you support the CPMF?

   Through your generous support, they serve the families of those who
   have served and protected Chicago’s citizens. The Foundation provides
   $50,000 to the family at the time of an officer’s death and continues
   to support the family by providing educational and tuition assistance
   for the officer’s children.

   Won’t you help?

   The Foundation pledges to “Never Forget” the families of Chicago’s
   fallen and catastrophically injured officers and they keep that promise
   several times throughout the year at events like the Candlelight Vigil,
   Operation Santa and the Run to Remember. Won’t you please show that you
   still remember them too by making a donation today?
