He Struck Gold on the Net (Really)

   Rob McEwen owned an underperforming gold mine in northwestern Ontario,
   and he needed new ideas about where to dig. So he broke new ground --
   and made data on the mine available online to anyone who wanted to
   help. Eureka! The Internet gold rush was on.
   By Linda Tischler

   In January 1848, a work crew at John Sutter's mill, near Sacramento,
   California, came across a few select nuggets of gold. Before long, a
   half-million prospectors arrived there seeking instant riches. The gold
   rush was on. Some 153 years later, another gold rush broke out at an
   old mine called Red Lake, in northwestern Ontario. This time, the
   fortune hunters wielded geological-modeling software and database
   mining tools rather than picks and shovels. The big winners were from
   Australia. And they had never even seen the mine.

   Rob McEwen, chairman and CEO of Goldcorp Inc., based in Toronto, had
   triggered the gold rush by issuing an extraordinary challenge to the
   world's geologists: We'll show you all of our data on the Red Lake mine
   online if you tell us where we're likely to find the next 6 million
   ounces of gold. The prize: a total of $575,000, with a top award of
   $105,000.

   The mining community was flabbergasted. "We've seen very large data
   sets from government surveys online," says Nick Archibald, managing
   director of Fractal Graphics, the winning organization from West Perth,
   Australia. "But for a company to post that information and say, 'Here I
   am, warts and all,' is quite unusual indeed."

   McEwen knew that the contest, which he called the Goldcorp Challenge,
   entailed big risks. For one thing, it exposed the company to a
   hostile-takeover bid. But the risks of continuing to do things the old
   way were even greater. "Mining is one of humanity's oldest industrial
   pursuits," McEwen says. "This is old old economy. But a mineral
   discovery is like a technological discovery. There's the same rapid
   creation of wealth as rising expectations improve profitability. If we
   could find gold faster, we could really improve the value of the
   company."

   McEwen, a small, soft-spoken man with a neatly trimmed mustache and
   meticulous tailoring, had one big advantage over his slow-footed
   competitors: He wasn't a miner, he didn't think like a miner, and he
   wasn't constrained by a miner's conventional wisdom. As a young man, he
   went to work for Merrill Lynch, following his father into the
   investment business. But his father also had a fascination with gold,
   and McEwen grew up hearing tales of miners, prospectors, and grubstakes
   at the dinner table. Soon he was bitten by the gold bug too, and he
   hammered out a template of what he thought a 21st-century gold-mining
   company should look like. In 1989, he saw his chance. He stepped into a
   takeover battle as a white knight and emerged as majority owner of an
   old and underperforming mine in Ontario.

   It was hardly a dream come true. The gold market was depressed. The
   mine's operating costs were high. The miners went on strike. McEwen
   even got a death threat. But the new owner knew that the mine had
   potential. "The Red Lake gold district had 2 operating gold mines and
   13 former mines that had produced more than 18 million ounces
   combined," he says. "The mine next door had produced about 10 million
   ounces. Ours had produced only 3 million."

   McEwen believed that the high-grade ore that ran through the
   neighboring mine was present in parts of the 55,000-acre Red Lake stake
   -- if only he could find it. His strategy began to take shape at a
   seminar at MIT in 1999. Company presidents from around the world had
   come there to learn about advances in information technology.
   Eventually, the group's attention turned to the Linux operating system
   and the open-source revolution. "I said, 'Open-source code! That's what
   I want!' " McEwen recalls.

   His reasoning: If he could attract the attention of world-class talent
   to the problem of finding more gold in Red Lake, just as Linux managed
   to attract world-class programmers to the cause of better software, he
   could tap into thousands of minds that he wouldn't normally have access
   to. He could also speed up exploration and improve his odds of
   discovery.

   At first, Goldcorp's geologists were appalled at the idea of exposing
   their super-secret data to the world. "This is a very conservative,
   very private industry," says Dr. James M. Franklin, former chief
   geoscientist for the Geological Survey of Canada and a judge in the
   Goldcorp Challenge. "Confidentiality and secrecy about reserves and
   exploration have been its watchwords. This was a totally unconventional
   thing to do."

   But in March 2000, at an industry meeting, McEwen unveiled the Goldcorp
   Challenge. The external response was immediate. More than 1,400
   scientists, engineers, and geologists from 50 countries downloaded the
   company's data and started their virtual exploration. When the entries
   started coming in, the panel of five judges was astonished by the
   creativity of the submissions. The top winner was a collaboration by
   two groups in Australia: Fractal Graphics, in West Perth, and Taylor
   Wall & Associates, in Queensland, which together had developed a
   powerful 3-D graphical depiction of the mine.

   For McEwen, the contest itself was a gold mine. "We have drilled four
   of the winners' top five targets and have hit on all four," he says.
   "But what's really important is that from a remote site, the winners
   were able to analyze a database and generate targets without ever
   visiting the property. It's clear that this is part of the future."

   Between the new high-grade discoveries and the mine's modernized
   facilities, Red Lake is finally performing along the lines that McEwen
   had envisioned. In 1996, Red Lake was producing at an annual rate of
   53,000 ounces at $360 an ounce. By 2001, the mine was producing 504,000
   ounces at $59 an ounce. On the open market, gold currently trades for
   about $307 an ounce. The grade of the ore at McEwen's mine is
   extraordinarily high, confirming his suspicion that the vein that ran
   through the neighboring mine continues through Red Lake.

   For McEwen, whose passion for gold is evident from the 82-pound sample
   rock containing 300 ounces of gold that he displays in his office and
   the dazzling gold, diamond, and lapis wedding ring that he sports on
   his finger, it doesn't get much better than this. "When you first pick
   up a piece of gold and hold it in your hand, when you feel the weight
   and see the luster, you feel like this is something special," McEwen
   says. "It's different than mining coal."

Sidebar: Nuggets of Wisdom

   Red Lake, Ontario and West Perth, Australia are at opposite ends of the
   earth. But that didn't stop Nick Archibald and his team of geologists
   at Fractal Graphics, an Australian geoscience consulting firm, from
   thinking that they could find gold in Canada.

   First-place winners of the 2001 Goldcorp Challenge, Archibald and his
   mates shared a grand prize of $105,000 for their presentation detailing
   likely targets for finding gold. "I'd never been to the mine,"
   Archibald says. "I'd never even been to Canada."

   But when he learned of the contest, Archibald recognized an opportunity
   for his company, which specializes in the production of 3-D models of
   mines. The prize money was appealing, but Archibald knew that winning
   would give a boost to his own hopes for expansion funds as well. "Our
   industry has been going through a hard time," he says. "We had been
   trying to raise venture capital. Any positive news could only be a big
   help for us."

   Although the prize money, which Archibald's team shared with Taylor
   Wall & Associates, barely covered the cost of the project, the
   publicity has boosted the firm's business. "It would have taken us
   years to get the recognition in North America that this project gave us
   overnight," he says.

   More important, Archibald adds, the Challenge has opened the industry's
   eyes to a new way of doing exploration. "This has been a big change for
   mining," he says. "This has been like a beacon in a sea of darkness."
