   Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York has been raising money for his reelection
   essentially since he took office in 2010. His campaign account has been
   in the eight figures since 2012; he's been raising $5 million or more
   every six months like clockwork. In Tuesday's New York Democratic
   gubernatorial primary, he won by a healthy margin, against a candidate
   who didn't raise much at all.

   But it cost him.

   We were inspired to crunch the numbers on how much Cuomo laid out as
   compared to what Teachout spent out by a tweet from the New York Times'
   Nick Confessore. "I wonder what a dollars per vote metric would show on
   Cuomo-Teachout and Hochul-Wu," he asked.
   [costper.png&amp;w=480]

   The short answer is: Cuomo spent $60.62 for each of his votes. Teachout
   spent $1.57.

   Now the long answer. In his final report to the New York Board of
   Elections, Cuomo reported having $30.5 million in the bank. Since 2011,
   he's spent almost $20 million on his race; according to reports filed
   in 2014, he's spent about $14 million of that over the last 12 months.
   Teachout, by contrast, raised about $600,000 and spent $283,000. (As of
   11 days before the election; candidates report final numbers next
   week.)

   Cuomo earned 327,150 votes, according to the most recent data from the
   AP. Teachout got 180,336. Giving us the following, depending on if you
   want to count Cuomo's 2012 spending.
       Candidate          Spent       Votes  Cost per vote
   Cuomo (since 2011) $19,832,556.23 327,150 $60.62
   Cuomo (2014)       $13,950,067.32 327,150 $42.64
   Teachout           $283,918.51    180,336 $1.57

   If you don't have a calculator handy, that means that Cuomo spent 38.5
   times as much on each of his votes as Zephyr Teachout. If he'd gotten
   the same return on investment as she did for his $19 million, he'd have
   gotten 12.6 million votes -- more than enough to guarantee a win, and
   about two-thirds of the population of the entire state.
