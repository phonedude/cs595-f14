Revamp Traditional Lectures with Interactive Tools

   Yawn! There's little that can bore students more than the traditional
   lecture. When instructors don't take the simple steps to help them
   interact with the content, why should they care? If you're looking to
   wake up your students and infuse your classroom with more engagement,
   it's time to tap a new generation of classroom tools driven by
   assessment and mastery. Founders from edtech companies will offer tips
   on choosing tools. Plus, you'll get the learner perspective from a
   student survivor!
