How it works

Immerse yourself

   You will spend your first few weeks with the rest of the Technology and
   Innovation team at our headquarters in Washington, D.C., to learn about
   the CFPB's mission, get to know our team, and understand our work.

Hunker down

   After immersion, you can work from anywhere in the United States of
   America, including our headquarters in D.C., as long as you have a high
   speed internet connection. You will be in daily contact with your
   teammates and other colleagues across the Bureau.

Regroup

   You will return to CFPB headquarters periodically, at critical stages
   of your projects and to collaborate with the rest of the Technology and
   Innovation team.

Meet our current fellows

   In January of 2013, our first class of fellows began their two-year
   term at the CFPB. This group included 8 Graphic Designers, 7 User
   Experience Designers, 7 Front-end Developers, and 8 Back-end
   Developers. Here's what a few of our current fellows had to say about
   their experience:

   "I've had the opportunity to do so much more than I was expecting. I've
   designed web tools to aid consumers shopping for mortgages,
   user-friendly forms for submitting complaints, and reports to
   Congress."

   "I work on Owning a Home, an upcoming online tool that will provide
   consumers with tools to better understand the process necessary for
   homeownership. As a veteran, working at CFPB has allowed me to serve my
   country in a different way."

Back-end Developer

   "I work on eRegulations. I helped develop the parser, the compiler, and
   the regulation viewer that displays regulatory information that's easy
   to read, access, and understand."

The positions

Software Product Development

   CFPB's software developers build tools for the Bureau as well as for
   the public. But they also build tools for themselves, to ensure their
   products are stable, resilient, and secure. Designers are also critical
   to CFPB's software development process: with a foundation in
   user-centered design, the Design team develops the Bureau's visual
   brand, custom front-end software, and produces editorial videos,
   photography, and webcasts.

User Experience (UX) Designer

   UX designers represent the User's needs throughout the development
   process of the CFPB's products and applications by conducting research,
   gathering content requirements, determining information architecture,
   conducting usability tests, and designing interactions, navigation, and
   interfaces.

   Graphic Designers use typography, composition, color, imagery, and
   logos to effectively communicate the Bureau's mission through its
   website, software, and print materials.

Front-End Developer

   Front end developers at the CFPB are responsible for developing and
   maintaining the interface of CFPB web products. Our front-end team
   writes template markup, CSS, and JavaScript while ensuring
   accessibility standards and maintaining a high-quality user experience.
   View details

Software Developer

   Software Developer fellows specialize in one of three disciplines: API
   and Web Developers work with Python, JavaScript, Clojure, PostgreSQL,
   MongoDB, and Git to build software for our website and tools for Bureau
   staff. Software Delivery Automators shepherd unit/integration, browser,
   and load testing; continuous delivery; and monitoring. They rely on
   Jenkins, TravisCI, Selenium WebDriver, Python/Behave/Gherkin,
   SauceLabs, and JMeter, and are eager to expand their toolkit.
   Infrastructure Automation Engineers (DevOps) architect, build, and
   secure cloud environments that are resilient, performant, and scalable
   using tools like Puppet, Simian Army, Edda, and Ice. These
   professionals fix server-layer issues, write software and scripts to
   prevent issue recurrence, and build infrastructure to support the
   Bureau's software solutions.

Cybersecurity

   The CFPB Office of Cybersecurity performs several vital functions that
   help the Bureau manage risk, providing security for the information and
   information systems that support the operations and assets of the
   agency. The team monitors and analyzes information to detect and
   respond to threats.

Engineer/Administrator

   Maintains the network monitoring sensor grid and supporting components,

   The CFPB is a data driven agency. We take in information, manage it,
   store it, share it appropriately, and protect it from unauthorized
   access. The Data Team supports CFPB's efforts to be a data driven
   agency. The Team serves a wide variety of functions from day-to-day
   data management and operations, to high-level data analytics and
   visualizations.

The work we do

eRegulations

   The eRegulations tool parses public regulation information, extracts
   structure and meaning from that data, and then presents the regulation
   in a format that's easy to read and understand. It also helps keep
   track of the history of regulations over time.

Visualizing public information

   The Bureau launched an easy-to-use, online tool that enables consumers
   to explore public information about the mortgage market. This set of
   web-based JavaScript applications runs on top of an API we built using
   QU, our own Clojure-powered tool.

AskCFPB

   AskCFPB, available in English and Spanish, is an interactive online
   tool that helps consumers find clear, unbiased answers to their
   financial questions. Users can search over 1,000 commonly asked
   consumer finance questions.

Information design

   Clear, concise information is essential to helping Americans make
   financial decisions. Some examples of our information design work
   include the college cost shopping sheet and our work on college debt
   repayment guide.

Graphic design

   At the CFPB we see design as an effective tool to help solve complex
   challenges. By integrating high graphic standards into all facets of
   our work, we are empowering consumers and changing the way government
   approaches design. Take a look at our design reel.

Cybersecurity

   We're refining our tools to track and analyze cybersecurity incidents
   and enhance our capability to monitor and secure our IT infrastructure.
   We're also enhancing our sensor grid to look deeper into network and
   system events and defend against cyber-attacks.

Data analytics

   The CFPB uses a range of machine learning and data analysis techniques
   to better understand the markets we regulate and carry out our job of
   protecting consumers.

Web analytics

   We help our colleagues to leverage digital analytics, research, and
   data science techniques in order to tailor design and content to
   improve consumer engagement.

Our technology vision

   Technology contributes to every facet of the CFPB's work. Our near-term
   goals include:
     * Empowering consumers: People need fair, unbiased, and
       understandable information about their finances. Help us design the
       tools and disclosures that millions of people rely upon to make
       financial choices.
     * Providing market insight: Are foreclosures up? Are credit card
       debts reaching a tipping point? What's driving student loan
       defaults? Help us analyze market data to spot financial trends and
       ensure that institutions are complying with the law.
     * Bringing regulatory examination into the digital age: The CFPB
       employs examiners who monitor the practices of consumer financial
       institutions. It's important that they do that job well. They need
       the best tools possible. Help us innovate the tools they need to do
       their work.
     * Assisting consumers directly: Our Consumer Response team
       facilitates solving real problems for people in difficult financial
       situations with few places to turn. Help us help consumers.
     * Improving government: Use technology to create an organization that
       feels and acts like a small team instead of a large one; and
       monitor our progress through data analytics to ensure our work
       reaches its intended audience, both inside the Bureau and across
       the country.
     * Building our foundation: Achieving these goals requires stable,
       secure infrastructure that meets stringent federal guidelines. Help
       us lead the effort to exceed them.
     * Employing advanced analytics: Increasingly allow Bureau decisions
       to be data-driven, using techniques such as machine learning,
       pattern recognition, and distributed systems to inform everything
       from enforcement to consumer education to rulemaking.

Frequently asked questions

What is a CFPB Technology and Innovation Fellowship?

   It is a two-year program for software developers, web designers,
   security engineers, and data architects and analysts to work with the
   CFPB to perform the work of a vital government agency, serve millions
   of consumers, and support the consumer financial marketplace.

What should I know about applying for a federal job?

   When we begin taking applications, this page will have links to the
   vacancy announcement (job posting) for each position on USAJobs.gov.
   When applying, make sure to pay careful attention to the minimum
   qualification standards for each position, which will be listed on the
   USAJobs.gov announcement under the “Qualifications Required" heading.
   You must ensure that your resume, or other materials attached to your

   process, as well as OPM's FAQ for those seeking a federal job.

What skills are you looking for?

   We're looking for back-end and front-end web developers, UX designers,
   graphic designers, cybersecurity engineers and tool developers, and
   data architects and analysts. But more than that, we're looking for
   people who are curious, bring diverse backgrounds and perspectives, can
   communicate well with non- technical people, and are passionate about
   solving problems. We are looking for highly-skilled, creative
   individuals that love learning new things and are eager to serve the
   American public.

What does the CFPB offer?

   The CFPB is an equal opportunity employer. We offer a workplace that is
   respectful, fair, and values diversity. CFPB offers comprehensive
   benefits in addition to salary, including: ten paid holidays, ability
   to accrue up to 13 days of vacation time and 13 days of sick leave each
   year, a wide range of health insurance plans, coverage for pre-existing
   conditions, and no waiting periods (we pay up to 75% of your health
   insurance premium), dental, vision, and life insurance, and flexible
   spending accounts for health care and dependent care.

Where will I work?

   You can work from anywhere in the United States (subject to all
   applicable Bureau policies and procedures) or at our headquarters in
   Washington D.C.

What will I need if I work from home?

   You will need a strong broadband connection to support video
   conferencing and other remote collaboration tools. Other necessary
   equipment will be provided to you.

How often will I travel?

   You will travel at least quarterly to regroup with the entire
   Technology team at our headquarters. Other travel will depend on your
   projects.

What will the average day be like?

   Maybe you'll work side-by-side with an economist, helping spot trends
   in the marketplace. Maybe you'll redesign forms and disclosures so that
   they are easier for the public to understand. You may help maintain the
   CFPB's API catalog, working with outside developers to make the most of
   our public data. Or maybe you'll create fundamental tools for the
   Bureau that will be used for years after your fellowship ends.

   You'll likely spend a lot of time working directly with mission
   partners, learning the finer points of their work to help you build
   better tools for them. Intellectual curiosity and good communication
   are an essential part of this job. You'll also spend a lot of time with
   your cohorts and with the rest of the Technology team.

What tools will I use?

   Developers: We develop on Macs using a wide variety of languages. On
   the back end, we tend to develop custom web applications using Python
   (often with Django), but we also develop with Clojure and PHP
   (consumerfinance.gov is partly powered by WordPress). On the front end,
   we use Grunt and Bower to manage our HTML5, Less, and JavaScript
   codebases. We use GitHub to manage all of our code. For automated
   testing and continuous integration we use Selenium and Jenkins.

   Designers: We use the latest Adobe Creative Suite, as well as GitHub to
   manage prototypes, feedback, and bugs.

   Security engineers: We use a combination of open source and
   industry-leading technologies including intrusion detection/prevention
   systems, firewalls, vulnerability & compliance scanners, antivirus, and
   more. We're evaluating and implementing new technologies across the
   organization.

   Data experts: Our data architecture is primarily PostgreSQL- and MS
   SQL-based, though we're always looking into other scalable platforms
   and tools. For data science, we use R, Python (NumPy, SciPy,
   scikit-learn, etc.), Julia, or whatever tools are necessary for
   analyzing data (as well as some Stata and SAS for older projects). For
   web analytics, we use Google Analytics and supporting tools, Tableau,
   paid search, and SEO tools (plus some data science and visualization
   tools).

What if I don't know how to use those tools? Can I still apply?

   Some of our work must be done according to the standards we've already
   set. But we're open to applicants with other backgrounds, especially
   those who are eager to share their knowledge with us. If you like to
   learn new tools and technologies and pick them up very easily, we want
   to hear from you.

Are there any other requirements?

   You must be a US Citizen to be considered.

Will anyone see my work?

   Yes. Per our source code policy, we make as much of our work available
   to the public as possible. We also discuss some of the technical
   details of our work on GitHub.

What if I have more questions?

   Feel free to contact us directly at tech@consumerfinance.gov.
