Big Data Privacy: Advancing the State of the Art in Technology and Practice

   Organized by the MIT Big Data Initiative at CSAIL and the MIT
   Information Policy Project
   MIT Dome at night

   The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and MIT
   co-hosted a public workshop entitled “Big Data Privacy: Advancing the
   State of the Art in Technology and Practice” on March 3, 2014. The
   event was part of a series of workshops on big data and privacy
   organized by the MIT Big Data Initiative at CSAIL and the MIT
   Information Policy Project. The workshop was also the first in a series
   of events being held across the country in response to President
   Obama’s call for a review of privacy issues in the context of increased
   digital information and the computing power to process it.

   The workshop convened key stakeholders and thought leaders from across
   academia, government, industry, and civil society for a thoughtful
   dialogue on the future role of technology in protecting and managing
   privacy. Concentrations included core technical challenges associated
   with big data applications and provide a theoretical grounding for
   privacy considerations in large-scale information systems. State of the
   art in privacy-protecting technologies and how they can be applied to a
   diversity of big data applications were explored.

   Topics included:
     * Big Data Opportunities and Risks
     * State of the Art of Privacy Protection
     * Review of Emerging Privacy Technologies
     * Industry, Government, Academic Roundtable

   The MIT Big Data Privacy Workshop Summary Report is now available for
   viewing or download.

     * MIT President Rafael Reif
     * White House Counselor John Podesta (Keynote Speaker)
     * Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker (Keynote Speaker)
