   What makes a genius a genius?

   According to these graphics, it's good time management.

   Using Mason Currey's book Daily Rituals: How Artists Work - which draws
   on diaries and letters from the thinkers themselves - designer RJ
   Andrews has mapped out the comings and goings of some of history's most
   important figures, right down to the hour.

   From Mozart to Freud and Darwin to Dickens, the waking, working and, in
   some cases, procrastinating of history's greatest minds are laid out
   for scrutiny.

   From Balzac drinking 50 cups of black coffee a day, to Milton spending
   hours memorising the Bible, the results are not always as you would
   expect. The variation is also surprising, from Freud's 13 hours of work
   a day to Mozart's four, there is not, alas, a simple recipe for
   success.

   Even so, people can now mimic the schedule of their intellectual
   heroes. Who knows, something might rub off...
   The graphs are laid out as circles broken up into 24 equal sized
   segments, each representing an hour
   The different types of activity are identified by colour

   For the year of 1781 at least, Mozart was a sporadic worker, buckling
   down for a couple of hours early in the morning and late at night. He
   spent nearly twice as long each day socialising
