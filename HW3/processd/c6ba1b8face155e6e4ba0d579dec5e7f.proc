Green bananas and the Internet of Things

   Markus Weinberger
   05/05/2014
   Business Models, Internet of Things

   At the Bosch IoT Lab at the University of St. Gallen, we are currently
   researching the influence of the Internet of Things (IoT) on business
   models. Having re-read the well-known articles “What is Web 2.0?” by
   Tim O’Reilly and “What is the Internet of Things” by Elgar Fleisch, I
   was tempted when coming up with the idea for this blog post to headline
   it “What is Web 3.0?” But since I wanted to avoid placing my humble
   post in the same category as those iconic papers, I went for bananas
   instead…

   Elgar makes some very important points in his article. The analogy of
   the IoT enabling “high resolution management” is in many cases very
   helpful to me when thinking about IoT applications and business models.

   For example, Rolls-Royce is famous for introducing the
   “Power-by-the-hour” program for its jet engines. In this business model
   the jet operator pays a fixed fee per flying hour for maintenance.
   Remote monitoring of the engine’s condition is a key factor in making
   such a business model successful. For me, increasing the resolution
   means the same principles can be applied to much smaller and less
   expensive devices than jet engines. Thanks to decreasing component
   prices and ubiquitous connectivity, Brother, for example, is already
   able to offer a pay-per-use business model for rather inexpensive laser
   printers.

   Thus, high resolution management in this context means that what was
   too expensive to be measured yesterday will be measured in the IoT age.
   The Internet of Things will dramatically increase the density of
   connected sensors per square, just as the density of pixels on image
   sensors will also increase.

   Certainly the article “What is the Internet of Things?” is very
   relevant when looking at the IoT, but there are some interesting
   aspects in O’Reilly’s article, too.

   He summarizes up eight Web 2.0 Design Patterns:
    1. The Long Tail
    2. Data is the Next Intel Inside
    3. Users Add Value
    4. Network Effects by Default
    5. Some Rights Reserved
    6. The Perpetual Beta
    7. Cooperate, Don’t Control
    8. Software Above the Level of a Single Device

   Looking at these patterns (written in 2005!) from an IoT perspective,
   they still appear remarkably fresh and meaningful. And they are really
   good food for thought. To give but one example: No. 6 “The Perpetual
   Beta” was clearly meant for software when O’Reilly wrote his paper.

     The Perpetual Beta: When devices and programs are connected to the
     internet, applications are no longer software artifacts, they are
     ongoing services. Therefore: Don’t package up new features into
     monolithic releases, but instead add them on a regular basis as part
     of the normal user experience. Engage your users as real-time
     testers, and instrument the service so that you know how people use
     the new features.

   But in the light of the IoT, software becomes an integral part of more
   and more connected devices. This means that the principle of a
   perpetual beta also becomes applicable to physical devices, in a way.
   Even after they buy a product, customers can profit from future
   development of it. What is true for smart phones, computers or, let’s
   say, TVs today will one day be true for cars, heating systems and
   watches, too: They ripen after delivery to the customer; just like
   green bananas.

   What insights do you get when looking at those eight patterns through
   the IoT lens?
