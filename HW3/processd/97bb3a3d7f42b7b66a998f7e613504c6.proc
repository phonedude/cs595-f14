Why Jill Abramson Was Fired

   This post was updated at 10 P.M.

   At the annual City University Journalism School dinner, on Monday, Dean
   Baquet, the managing editor of the New York Times, was seated with
   Arthur Sulzberger, Jr., the paper’s publisher. At the time, I did not
   give a moment’s thought to why Jill Abramson, the paper’s executive
   editor, was not at their table. Then, at 2:36 P.M. on Wednesday, an
   announcement from the Times hit my e-mail, saying that Baquet would
   replace Abramson, less than three years after she was appointed the
   first woman in the top job. Baquet will be the first African-American
   to lead the Times.

   Fellow-journalists and others scrambled to find out what had happened.
   Sulzberger had fired Abramson, and he did not try to hide that. In a
   speech to the newsroom on Wednesday afternoon, he said, “I chose to
   appoint a new leader of our newsroom because I believe that new
   leadership will improve some aspects …” Abramson chose not to attend
   the announcement, and not to pretend that she had volunteered to step
   down.

   As with any such upheaval, there’s a history behind it. Several weeks
   ago, I’m told, Abramson discovered that her pay and her pension
   benefits as both executive editor and, before that, as managing editor
   were considerably less than the pay and pension benefits of Bill
   Keller, the male editor whom she replaced in both jobs. “She confronted
   the top brass,” one close associate said, and this may have fed into
   the management’s narrative that she was “pushy,” a characterization
   that, for many, has an inescapably gendered aspect. Sulzberger is known
   to believe that the Times, as a financially beleaguered newspaper,
   needed to retreat on some of its generous pay and pension benefits;
   Abramson, who spent much of her career at the Wall Street Journal, had
   been at the Times for far fewer years than Keller, which accounted for
   some of the pension disparity. Eileen Murphy, a spokeswoman for the
   Times, said that Jill Abramson’s total compensation as executive editor
   “was directly comparable to Bill Keller’s”—though it was not actually
   the same. I was also told by another friend of Abramson’s that the pay
   gap with Keller was only closed after she complained. But, to women at
   an institution that was once sued by its female employees for
   discriminatory practices, the question brings up ugly memories.
   [Update: On Thursday, Sulzberger gave his staff a memo on what he said
   was “misinformation” on the pay question. “It is simply not true that
   Jill’s compensation was significantly less than her predecessors,” he
   wrote. “Her pay is comparable to that of earlier executive editors.”]
   Whether Abramson was right or wrong, both sides were left unhappy. A
   third associate told me, “She found out that a former deputy managing
   editor”—a man—“made more money than she did” while she was managing
   editor. [Update: The man in question, John Geddes, was in fact the
   managing editor of news operations.] “She had a lawyer make polite
   inquiries about the pay and pension disparities, which set them off.”

   Sulzberger’s frustration with Abramson was growing. She had already
   clashed with the company’s C.E.O., Mark Thompson, over native
   advertising and the perceived intrusion of the business side into the
   newsroom. Publicly, Thompson and Abramson denied that there was any
   tension between them, as Sulzberger today declared that there was no
   church-state—that is, business-editorial—conflict at the Times. A
   politician who made such implausible claims might merit a front-page
   story in the Times. The two men and Abramson clearly did not get along.

   A third issue surfaced, too: Abramson was pushing to hire a deputy
   managing editor to oversee the digital side of the Times. She believed
   that she had the support of Sulzberger and Thompson to recruit this
   deputy, and her supporters say that the plan was for the person in this
   position to report to Baquet. Baquet is a popular and respected figure
   in the newsroom, and he had appeared, for the most part, to get along
   with Abramson. (I was told, however, that, at a recent dinner with
   Sulzberger, Baquet said he found her hard to work with.) He is also
   someone whom Sulzberger passed over when he chose Abramson. But Baquet
   apparently felt that he hadn’t been consulted, and, according to two
   sources, expressed his concerns to Sulzberger. He had also reportedly
   been approached by Bloomberg about a job there. (Baquet has not yet
   responded to a request for comment; neither has Abramson.)

   In a reflection of the fractious relationship that Baquet and others
   had with Abramson, the Times reported that Baquet, speaking to the
   newsroom after his appointment, “praised Ms. Abramson for teaching him
   ‘the value of great ambition’ and then added that John Carroll, whom he
   worked for at The Los Angeles Times, ‘told me that great editors can
   also be humane editors.’”

   These issues seemed to coalesce for Sulzberger and Thompson. The reason
   Sulzberger originally hesitated to appoint Abramson as executive editor
   was a worry about her sometimes brusque manner. As I wrote in my
   Profile of Abramson, others in the newsroom, including some women, had
   the same concern. But, although there are always complaints about the
   Times’ supposed “liberal” bias, or its preoccupation with certain
   stories, Abramson got high marks for the investigative stories that she
   championed. At a time when Bloomberg News pulled the plug on an
   investigation of corruption and the princelings in China, Abramson
   pushed the Times to do more, even after her reporters came under
   pressure in China. [Update: Bloomberg maintains that the investigation
   is still active and that it has published other stories on princelings.
   The story in question has been held since last fall, however, prompting
   the resignation of three journalists.] Even though she thought she was
   politely asking about the pay discrepancy and about the role of the
   business side, and that she had a green light from management to hire a
   deputy to Baquet, the decision to terminate her was made. Sulzberger
   met with her last Friday, and reportedly told her that it was time to
   make “a change.”

   their conversation at last year’s New Yorker Festival.
