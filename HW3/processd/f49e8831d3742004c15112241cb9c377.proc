Maker Culture as a Learning Model

   May 22, 2013 Sean Wheeler

   Thinker Dale Dougherty, founder of Make magazine, believes that “all of
   us are makers“.  In and of itself, this is a powerful statement about
   belief in life-long learning.  It is also, when applied to the goals of
   education, a reminder that learning is a mindset and not a list of
   content and skills to be learned.  Makers ask questions of the world,
   they explore and dare, they theorize, prototype, and refine.  They set
   out, unasked, to identify holes in possibility and fill them with the
   products of their hands and mind.  They are intrinsic learners, but to
   say they don’t need to do anything they do doesn’t give due respect to
   the passion that compels them to make their own work and learn from it.
    Makers can’t help but make, and the real question is why isn’t
   everyone, then, in reality and despite what Dale Dougherty envisions, a
   maker?  Why isn’t this the dominant model for education in the first
   place?

   Part of the problem has to have something to do with money.  I didn’t
   meet many public school folks at this weekend’s Maker Faire.  Most of
   the students displaying their work in connection with school were all
   private school kids.  They seemed to have access to materials, tools,
   and an education paradigm that fostered creativity and innovation.  As
   a public school teacher, I must admit to a fair amount of envy.
   There’s not a lot of room in the budget for a 3D printer or drill press
   these days.  I also wonder if there’s something even worse going on
   though, I wonder if we’re not making in schools because that’s harder
   to sell for a profit than test scores and “data”.

   Or maybe, and most probably, our schools are not filled with makers
   because we don’t seem to want makers these days, we want test takers.
   We want to measure achievement in percentages rather than in actual
   accomplishment.  We want convergent thinkers aimed at targets, not
   divergent thinkers propelled like projectiles into the possible. The
   sad truth is that we are getting what we want, and we’re wanting the
   wrong things.  Describe to any teacher the mindsets that all makers
   possess and I’ll guarantee that teachers will agree that it is these
   things that we really want for our students.  Teachers don’t want to be
   data monkeys, they want to be teachers in the largest, and most human,
   sense.

   I’d like to think that teachers will soon become important participants
   in maker culture, as much as for what they can teach as for what they
   can learn.  My goal is to start connecting with my own local maker
   community, and I’d like to engage them in conversations about teaching,
   learning, sharing, and creating.  I’d also encourage other teachers to
   attend a Maker Faire or Mini Maker Faire in their area, and perhaps
   find a local hackerspace or makerspace to visit as well.
