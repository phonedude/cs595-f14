   Keynote #1 - The Second Machine Age
   Like steam power and electricity before it, the explosion of digitally
   enabled technologies is radically transforming the landscape of human
   endeavor. Astonishing progress in robotics, automation, and access to
   information presents major challenges for institutions from small
   businesses and communities to large corporations and governments, but
   it also creates opportunities to rethink how we live and work in
   profoundly positive ways.

   Nowcasting and Placecasting Growth Entrepreneurship
   Two novel methods help identify growth potential in firms that have met
   a simple but fundamental requirement for growth — incorporation.
   Placecasting tracks changing locational patterns of growth
   entrepreneurs over time, while Nowcasting develops an index of current
   growth entrepreneurship activity based on the number of incorporations
   comparable to past companies that showed high likelihood of achieving a
   growth outcome.

   How Will Entrepreneurship Change?
   Increasingly, recent graduates and other young people entering the
   workforce want to start companies of their own rather than find one to
   work for. As the economic and technological landscape continues to
   shift in the wake of the digital revolution, what capabilities must
   they cultivate? How will entrepreneurial activities change in response
   to the new business environment? And what can established companies
   learn from the next wave of entrepreneurial innovation?

   One Robot for Every Task
   The digitization of practically everything coupled with the mobile
   Internet, automation, and advanced robotics promises a future with
   democratized use of machines and wide-spread customization.
   Increasingly, cognitive machines and technologies for rapidly designing
   and fabricating new, more capable robots have the potential for
   broad-based impact, from manufacturing and construction to health-care,
   smart cities, transportation and other facets of everyday life.

   Factories of the Near Future
   Advances in hardware, computation, and sensing enable robots to perform
   an increasing percentage of traditionally manual tasks, yet often
   workers cannot be removed from the process entirely. Harnessing the
   relative strengths of workers and robots to optimize manufacturing
   processes for the near future requires adaptive work-sharing and
   scheduling algorithms to coordinate collaboration on two levels:
   one-to-one worker/robot teamwork and factory-level sequencing.
