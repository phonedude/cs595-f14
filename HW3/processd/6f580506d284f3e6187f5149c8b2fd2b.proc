How not to shoot civilians

9 community policing tips from a chief who got it right

by Dara Lind on September 18, 2014

   story,interview

   On September 18th, the Justice Department rolled out a new federal
   program designed to help local law enforcement rebuild their
   relationships with the communities they police. The killing of several
   unarmed civilians by police this summer, and the use of military gear
   to put down protests in Ferguson, Missouri, after one of those
   killings, have made it clear that in many parts of America that
   relationship is broken. Furthermore, there's a deeper cultural divide
   between police and the public: police are allowed to use force,
   including deadly force, much more often than the public thinks they
   ought to be, and officers want to use force even more often than
   they're allowed to.

   What can local cops do to fix this? They might want to look at
   Richmond, California. Richmond is a Bay Area town of 107,000 people;
   when we spoke to the police chief there, Chris Magnus, cops hadn't
   killed a civilian in five years. (A Richmond police officer fatally
   shot a civilian on September 14th.)

   Magnus cautions that "policing is local," and that what works for his
   department might not be appropriate for others. But here are some
   lessons he's learned about leading a department that doesn't use force
   as a first resort. The Justice Department might want to print out some
   copies.

1) Don't recruit cops by promising violence and adventure

   "You have to be thinking, as a police administrator, about what kind of
   folks you want to attract to your department, and how you do that. You
   look at some departments' recruiting materials, and you see guys
   jumping out of trucks in SWAT gear and people armed with every
   imaginable weapon. There are clearly situations where that is a
   necessary and appropriate part of police work. But having said that,
   that is by far and away not the norm.

   "My goal is to look for people who want to work in my community, not
   because it's a place where they think they're going to be dealing with
   a lot of violence and hot chases and armed individuals and excitement
   and an episode of Cops or something. I want them tactically capable to
   handle situations like that, but I want them to be here because they're
   interested in building a partnership with the community. They're not
   afraid to have a relationship with the residents that they serve, in
   terms of getting out of the car and talking to people. Those are
   messages that have to be sent early on, before people even get hired."

2) Train officers not just in what they can do, but in how to make good
decisions

   "It's important that officers have training that involves more than
   just being proficient in the use of a firearm. Obviously that's
   something they need to be able to do, but a big part of our training
   around use of force, specifically with use of firearms, is training in
   decision-making under stress. How and when do you consider the use of
   deadly force? What are the other options that were available to you?

   "There are still a lot of police academies in this country, whether
   they're through police agencies, colleges, or other institutions, that
   are probably not as far along as they should be in some of these areas.
   As a field, we can do better."

3) Give cops extra training in interacting with mentally-ill people — and
teenagers

   "We've done quite a bit of training, with our school resource officers
   and our juvenile detectives, about some of the better ways to
   communicate with youth — what approaches might be most appropriate if
   you have to use force. Some of that's really about brain development,
   and we're learning that young people really do respond differently than
   adults do."

   "We do a lot of training dealing with the mentally ill. We have
   officers on all of our shifts who have gotten even more detailed and
   involved training — crisis intervention training — dealing specifically
   with mentally-ill individuals. That covers understanding what the signs
   are that someone may be in a mental-health crisis, understanding about
   medications and the impact of those medicines that a lot of folks might
   be on, understanding what happens when they're not taking their
   medication, and getting better knowledge on how to interact or engage
   with people who are in crisis."

4) Training doesn't stop when you get out on the street

   "Our officers go through what is anywhere between six and eight months
   of additional training once they hit the streets. That involves being
   teamed up with other officers who are trained as trainers, and who
   provide them with ongoing and regular evaluation about what they're
   doing and help them learn from their mistakes in a more controlled
   setting."

5) Remember that you can kill someone with a Taser

   "Part of the problem with Tasers out in the community is, perhaps, this
   particular piece of law enforcement equipment has been misrepresented
   to suggest that it always can guarantee a good, less-than-lethal
   outcome. And that's not true. People have complicated health histories
   which you can't possibly know, most of the time, when you're dealing
   with them. There may be a lot of circumstances that complicate the use
   of a Taser that you couldn't know in advance.

   "The vast majority of our Taser use involves displaying it and
   informing the suspect that resisting arrest will result in them being
   tased. In other words, we don't even necessarily deploy it. And that's
   enough, most of the time."

   displaying the Taser is usually enough. (Jeff Topping/Getty)

6) Be proactive in addressing officers who use a lot of force — before they
become a problem

   "We have a database in which we track each officer's history in terms
   of how they use force. If we see an officer who seems to be using force
   more than somebody else, we take a more careful look at that. That
   doesn't always mean that the officer is doing something wrong or that
   they're just predisposed to use force. It might have to do with the
   area that they're working, the incidents they've been dealing with. But
   it still never hurts that we look more carefully and try to be as
   proactive as possible in addressing a situation before it becomes,
   potentially, a problem."

7) Don't be afraid to fire someone who's not cut out to be a police officer

   "It's hard when you've invested as much as a year or more into training
   somebody. But there are clearly some folks who can't multitask, they
   can't make good decisions under stress, they're not effective
   communicators. For whatever reasons, they're not cut out to be police
   officers. Part of the challenge of a professional police department is
   to make sure those folks are separated from service early on. So you
   have to be willing to do that — and to have the local political support
   within your city to do that."

   showed, it's much harder to build trust after an incident. (Joe

8) When force really is needed, a little community trust goes a long way

   "The use of force is something that, when people see it, they're
   horrified by it. Even though it may be completely legitimate and
   appropriate in a larger scheme, it's not easy to watch, and it's even
   more difficult to have to be part of.

   "You have to have an underlying relationship with the community so that
   there's a level of trust and understanding and people are willing to
   hear you out about why force was used in a set of circumstances. And
   the community can trust that when mistakes are made — which sometimes
   happens — your department's going to learn from them so they're not
   repeated."

9) Police departments can't do sufficient training without resources

   "It's totally appropriate and important that we have this national
   conversation about use of force. But I hope along with that is a
   commitment to the idea that it takes resources and financial support to
   do this kind of training. A lot of departments don't even have the
   personnel that they need to handle many of these situations. They
   certainly don't have the resources to commit to that type of training
   and equipment. So then you have cops that are really left with a
   knowledge gap and a resource gap. And I've worked in some smaller
   departments, where I've seen that it's very tough."

   CORRECTION: This article originally said that the Richmond Police
   Department hadn't had any civilian deaths in officer-involved
   shootings. On September 14th, after this interview was conducted but
   before the article was published, a Richmond police officer fatally
   shot a civilian. The article has been corrected to reflect this event.

   On September 18th, the Justice Department rolled out a new federal
   program designed to help local law enforcement rebuild their
   relationships with the communities they police. The killing of several
   unarmed civilians by police this summer, and the use of military gear
   to put down protests in Ferguson, MO after one of those killings, have
   made it clear that in many parts of America that relationship is
   broken. Furthermore, there's a deeper cultural divide between police
   and the public: police are allowed to use force, including deadly
   force, much more often than the public thinks they ought to be, and
   officers want to use force even more often than they're allowed to.

   What can local cops do to fix this? They might want to look at
   Richmond, California. Richmond is a Bay Area town of 107,000 people;
   September 14th.)

   I asked Magnus about what he's learned about leading a department that
   doesn't use force as a first resort. The Justice Department might want
   to print out some copies.

   Dara Lind: Talk to me about Richmond and your department. What's your
   record on use of force look like?

   Chris Magnus: This is a community that deals with a lot of crime. It's
   gotten significantly better over the years, but this is by no means a
   low-speed suburban enclave. Richmond is a busy urban environment. In
   the recent past, we were taking two guns a day off the street. For a
   number of reasons, happily, that's gone down, and now we're closer to a
   gun a day. But for a community of 110,000, that's still a lot of
   encounters that could end very badly.

   And since 2008, we've only had five incidents where our officers have
   actually shot suspects. And all of those have resulted in injury, not
   death. (Note: on September 14th, after this interview was conducted, a
   Richmond police officer fatally shot a civilian.) That is pretty
   remarkable given the level of gun violence we have in our city and the
   number of guns we're taking off the street.

   This really does speak to the fact that people are using a lot of
   restraint in the way they use force. They have a lot of experience and
   they're very thoughtful and creative in using a lot of different kinds
   of alternatives.

   Dara Lind: The professionals I've talked to have said that use-of-force
   policy is generally viewed as a force continuum, but there's not a lot
   of consensus about how that looks. What's the force continuum like in
   your department?

   Chris Magnus: I think of use of force as kind of a circle, and on that
   circle, around the perimeter, there are a number of different choices
   that, depending on the situation, an officer would be able to go
   directly to that particular resource or approach or tool. There are
   obviously going to be circumstances where the threat that the officer
   is dealing with, or the risk that a member of the public might be
   dealing with, are so great that it wouldn't make sense to start at the
   bottom of a force continuum. But there might be several different
   approaches that you might take.

   What we try to do is give our officers as many resources and as much
   training as possible to deal with different kinds of threats and
   circumstances, and then give them lots of practice in how to make the
   best possible choice that resolves that situation, hopefully, with the
   least amount of force necessary to reach a safe outcome for everybody
   involved.
   ""It's important that officers have training that involves more than
   the use of a firearm""

   One of the things that is particularly important is that officers
   receive more than just tactical training. It's an ongoing process, and
   it has to be repeated yearly, sometimes more often. We do a monthly
   firearms training — but that's not necessarily always out at the firing
   range. It's important that officers have training that involves more
   than just being proficient in the use of a firearm. Obviously, that's
   something they need to be able to do, but a big part of our training
   around use of force, specifically with use of firearms, is training in
   decision-making under stress. How and when do you consider the use of
   deadly force? What are the other options that were available to you?

   Dara Lind: Logistically, how does this training work?

   Chris Magnus: It's important, first of all, that officers go through a
   police academy that has an appropriate level of training on not only
   the technical aspects of using a firearm, but also about how they make
   decisions and how they talk to people. There are still a lot of police
   academies in this country, whether they're through police agencies,
   colleges, or other institutions, that are probably not as far along as
   they should be in some of these areas. As a field, we can do better.
   ""As a field, we can do better""

   But then, our officers go through what is anywhere between six and
   eight months of additional training once they hit the streets. That
   involves being teamed up with other officers who are trained as
   trainers and who provide them with ongoing and regular evaluation about
   what they're doing and help them learn from their mistakes in a more
   controlled setting.

   During that time period, we also discover whether people are really
   right for the job or not. And that's hard when you've invested as much
   as a year or more into training somebody. But there are clearly some
   folks who can't multitask, they can't make good decisions under stress,
   they're not effective communicators. For whatever reasons, they're not
   cut out to be police officers. And part of the challenge of a
   professional police department is to make sure those folks are
   separated from service early on. So you have to be willing to do that —
   and to have the local political support within your city to do that.

   Dara Lind: Does that apply also to officers who come from other
   departments?

   Chris Magnus:Yes, it does.

   You have to be thinking, as a police administrator, about what kind of
   folks you want to attract to your department, and how you do that. You
   look at some departments' recruiting materials, and you see guys
   jumping out of trucks in SWAT gear and people armed with every
   imaginable weapon. There are clearly situations where that is a
   necessary and appropriate part of police work. But that is by far and
   away not the norm.

   My goal, at least, is to look for people who want to work in my
   community, not because it's a place where they think they're going to
   be dealing with a lot of violence and hot chases and armed individuals
   and excitement and an episode of Cops or something. I want them
   tactically capable to handle situations like that, but I want them to
   be here because they're interested in building a partnership with the
   community. They're not afraid to have a relationship with the residents
   that they serve, in terms of getting out of the car and talking to
   people. They're not interested in being the anonymous cop who goes from
   call to call, but rather getting to know people and building a level of
   trust and communication.

   Those are messages that have to be sent early on, before people even
   get hired. You look at different departments' recruiting materials, and
   it becomes clear that they have different types of officers that they
   want to bring on board.

   SWAT team training SWAT team training

   This should not be the main image on a police recruitment brochure.
   (Boston Globe via Getty)
   ""They don't approach the community with an us-vs.-them mentality""

   That's relevant to the use-of-force discussion because I believe that,
   by and large, I have officers here who are very committed to being
   safe. They want to go home at the end of their shift, but they don't
   approach the community with an "us vs. them" mentality. They're
   assigned to a beat; they work that beat every day; they know the
   residents. That makes a huge difference when it comes to having to use
   force. Their first choice in most situations would be to try to talk to
   people or gain voluntary cooperation. But if they have to use it, they
   also have the training, the experience, the right tools and equipment,
   and the level of backup in a way that minimizes the chance somebody's
   going to get hurt — whether it's themselves or somebody else.

   Dara Lind: What types of alternatives does the department recommend to
   officers?

   Chris Magnus: In a lot of situations where someone's shot by the
   police, you have a single officer — or even, sometimes, two officers —
   who end up jumping out of a car and basically chasing someone into an
   area where they hope to hide or where they may already be familiar.
   It's a very dangerous situation for the officer, and it puts them at a
   significant disadvantage.

   We try to focus more on setting up a perimeter and containing a suspect
   in an area. Once you have a perimeter set up and somebody's contained,
   it really gives everyone a chance to slow down, and there are a lot
   more options that become available. Utilize an officer with a canine,
   do a track, get better information from witnesses. For us, that happens
   a lot of the time.

   Dara Lind:A lot of professionals say that it's very difficult for
   training to cover certain situations, like dealing with civilians who
   are mentally ill or substance abusers. Is that something that your
   department covers in training? How successful is that?

   Chris Magnus: Especially in today's world and certainly in our area, we
   would be seriously negligent as a department if we weren't providing
   our officers with a greater range of tools and resources to deal with
   those issues. We do a lot of training dealing with the mentally ill. We
   have officers on all of our shifts who have gotten even more detailed
   and involved training — crisis intervention training — dealing
   specifically with mentally-ill individuals. That covers understanding
   what the signs are that someone may be in a mental health crisis,
   understanding about medications and the impact of those medicines that
   a lot of folks might be on, understanding what happens when they're not
   taking their medication, and getting better knowledge on how to
   interact or engage with people who are in crisis.
   ""We're learning that young people really do respond differently""

   A somewhat related but different scenario is the increasing
   understanding that a lot of departments — maybe I'm being overly
   optimistic — are coming to in dealing with young people: realizing how
   the adolescent brain develops and responds to authority and the use of
   force. Which is pretty significantly different than older folks. We've
   done quite a bit of training with our school resource officers and our
   juvenile detectives about some of the better ways to communicate with
   youth, and what approaches might be most appropriate if you have to use
   force. Some of that's really about brain development, and we're
   learning that young people really do respond differently than adults
   do.

   Dara Lind: How feasible is it for a department to provide all this
   training for officers?

   Chris Magnus: It's totally appropriate and important that we have this
   national conversation about use of force. But I hope along with that is
   a commitment to the idea that it takes resources and financial support
   to do this kind of training. A lot of departments don't even have the
   personnel that they need to handle many of these situations. They
   certainly don't have the resources to commit to that type of training
   and equipment. So then you have cops that are really left with a
   knowledge gap and a resource gap. And I've worked in some smaller
   departments, where I've seen that it's very tough.

   Dara Lind: How does your department treat use of less-lethal weapons,
   like Tasers?

   Chris Magnus: It's a valuable tool. I don't think it's a guarantee of a
   less-than-lethal outcome, because we've certainly seen examples where
   people who have been tased have died. And officers need to understand
   that. Part of the problem with Tasers out in the community is, perhaps,
   this particular piece of law enforcement equipment has been
   misrepresented to suggest that it always can guarantee a good,
   less-than-lethal outcome. And that's not true. People have complicated
   health histories which you can't possibly know, most of the time, when
   you're dealing with them. There may be a lot of circumstances that
   complicate the use of a Taser that you couldn't know in advance.

   The vast majority of our Taser use involves displaying it and informing
   the suspect that resisting arrest will result in them being tased. In
   other words, we don't even necessarily deploy it. And that's enough,
   most of the time. But that doesn't always work. And the Taser can be a
   very important alternative to a situation where you might have to shoot
   someone otherwise.

   Dara Lind: What's the process for reviewing use-of-force incidents?

   Chris Magnus: First of all, officers are required to document any force
   that they use. Not only do they have to document that in the police
   reports that they might write up about an incident, but also in the
   specific use-of-force form. All of the documentation they do has to be
   reviewed by a supervisor.

   All of it then goes to a monthly use-of-force committee that includes
   one of our subject matter experts, who's involved in our training
   around use of force and tactics, and our legal adviser. They review the
   reports and look at "What can we learn? Do we have a training
   deficiency? Is this a situation where we need to work with an
   individual officer?" And if they see something that appears on its face
   to be a violation of our policy, they put their process on hold and
   send the incident to our Professional Standards Unit for investigation
   and follow-up. Which can lead to the conclusion that things were
   handled okay, and that's fine, but it might also show that there were
   policy violations and either additional training or discipline is
   warranted, depending on the circumstances and the officer involved.
   ""If we see an officer who seems to be using force more, we take a
   careful look""

   We have a database in which we track each officer's history in terms of
   how they use force. If we see an officer who seems to be using force
   more than somebody else, we take a more careful look at that. That
   doesn't always mean that the officer is doing something wrong or that
   they're just predisposed to use force. It might have to do with the
   area that they're working, the incidents they've been dealing with. But
   it still never hurts that we look more carefully and try to be as
   proactive as possible in addressing a situation before it becomes,
   potentially, a problem.

   Dara Lind: What happens in situations when the officer feels the use of
   force might be appropriate, but the community is still angry about the
   decision?

   Chris Magnus: One of the challenges that police are going to be dealing
   with more and more is that using force, especially force that involves
   hands-on fighting with somebody, is not only difficult to do, as a cop
   — and your risk of injury is huge — but it's something that people
   don't like to see. What's the analogy about making sausage? It tastes
   great, but you really don't want to see how it's made? The use of force
   is something that, when people see it, they're horrified by it. Even
   though it may be completely legitimate and appropriate in a larger
   scheme, it's not easy to watch, and it's even more difficult to have to
   be part of.

   You have to have an underlying relationship with the community so that
   there's a level of trust and understanding and people are willing to
   hear you out about why force was used in a set of circumstances. And
   the community can trust that when mistakes are made — which sometimes
   happens — your department's going to learn from them so they're not
   repeated.
