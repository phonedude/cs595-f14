Tell Your Member of Congress to Support Strong Gainful Employment Regulations

    Far too many students graduate from for-profit colleges with enormous
   amounts of debt and are not getting the skills they need to be
   successful in today’s workforce. They can’t find a job, they default on
   their loans, and taxpayers’ dollars have been wasted in the process,
   while these institutions continue to profit off of student debt.

   Tell your representative to ensure that career education programs are
   providing students with gainful employment in a recognized occupation.
   You can use the letter we provided below, or customize your own.
