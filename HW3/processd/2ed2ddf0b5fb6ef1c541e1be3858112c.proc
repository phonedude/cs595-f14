   Every year, the online magazine Edge--the so-called smartest website in
   the world, helmed by science impresario John Brockman--asks top
   scientists, technologists, writers, and academics to weigh in on a
   single question. This year, that query was "What Should We Be Worried
   About?", and the idea was to identify new problems arising in science,
   tech, and culture that haven't yet been widely recognized.

   This year's respondents include former presidents of the Royal Society,
   Nobel prize-winners, famous sci-fi authors, Nassem Nicholas Taleb,
   Brian Eno, and a bunch of top theoretical physicists, psychologists,
   and biologists. And the list is long. Like, book-length long. There are
   some 150 different things that worry 151 of the planet's biggest
   brains. And I read about them all, so you don't have to: here's the
   Buzzfeedized version, with the money quote, title, or summary of the
   fear pulled out of each essay. Obviously, go read the rest if any of
   the below get you fretting too.

   What keeps the smartest folks in the world awake at night? Here goes:

   1. The proliferation of Chinese eugenics. – Geoffrey Miller,
   evolutionary psychologist.

   2. Black swan events, and the fact that we continue to rely on models
   that have been proven fraudulent. – Nassem Nicholas Taleb

   beyond the error catastrophe threshold. – William McEwan, molecular
   biology researcher

   information scientist

   32. “It is possible that we are rare, fleeting specks of awareness in
   an unfeeling cosmic desert, the only witnesses to its wonder. It is
