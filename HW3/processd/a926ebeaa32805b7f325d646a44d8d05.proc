Lessons from a Career Marketing Big Ideas Lessons from a Career Marketing Big
Ideas Document Transcript

     * Lessons from a career marketing big ideas Tim O’Reilly O’Reilly
       Media @timoreilly Brooklyn Beta October 11, 2013 Friday, October
       11, 13
     * Interesting Work for Interesting People Friday, October 11, 13 For
       those of you who don’t know who I am... I run a technology
       publishing and events company called O’Reilly Media and an early
       stage venture capital firm O’Reilly AlphaTech Ventures. It was once
       said “The Internet was built with O’Reilly books,” and indeed,
       there is more than one internet billionaire who told me that his
       company was started with little more than an O’Reilly book. But my
       initial business plan was simply this: “Interesting work for
       interesting people.”
     * Changing the world by spreading the knowledge of innovators Friday,
       October 11, 13 Over time I re framed the real business of my
       company as “Changing the world by spreading the knowledge of
       innovators” That’s obviously aligned with the mission of Brooklyn
       Beta, and that’s why I’m honored to be here to talk with you.
     * Work on stuff that matters Friday, October 11, 13 When I give talks
       to Silicon Valley audiences, I generally remind entrepreneurs that
       they should “Work on stuff that matters”
     * Create more value than you capture Friday, October 11, 13 and
       “Create more value than you capture,” but I don’t need to do that
       here, because all of you are already interested in doing both of
       those things. Instead, I want to talk to you about marketing, and
       specifically, how I’ve learned to market big ideas and social
       movements, and to tell a story by bringing communities together.
     * Commercialization of the World Wide Web Open Source software Web
       2.0 The Maker Movement Open Data Open Government Friday, October
       11, 13 Here are some of the movements I’ve been able to help shape.
       My company created the first ad supported web site and did much of
       the early work to establish the web as a commercial medium. I also
       organized the meeting where the term “open source software” was
       agreed to and adopted by key free software developers. I
       popularized the term Web 2.0 to get people excited about the web
       again after the dot com bust. My company launched Make Magazine and
       Maker Faire and gave a name to the Maker Movement. And more
       recently, I’ve been working on open data, and more particularly,
       open government data.
     * In 1992, few people had heard of the Internet “We’re not going to
       market the book. We’re going to use the book to market the
       Internet.” - Brian Erwin former director of activism, The Sierra
       Club Friday, October 11, 13 My story as an activist begins with a
       book I published in 1992, The Whole Internet User’s Guide and
       Catalog. I had recently hired Brian Erwin, the former director of
       activism for the Sierra Club, to help me with marketing. He said to
       me, “We’re not ....” We went on a press tour, we sent a copy of the
       book to every member of the US Congress, and I spoke to
       congressional staff. But I wasn’t pushing myself, or my product,
       but the internet itself.
     * Lesson One: It’s not about you Friday, October 11, 13 We were
       unknown, but that didn’t stop us, because the story wasn’t about
       us. I was background - never quoted or mentioned by name - for many
       early stories about the internet. I’d spend hours educating
       reporters. But that gave me the chance to frame the story, even
       though I didn’t get any obvious press. And eventually, I did go
       from being an unnamed source to being frequently quoted.
     * Lesson Two: It’s never too early to tell a big story Friday,
       October 11, 13 At the time we published the book, there were only
       200 web sites. But we knew the web was going to be important.
     * In 1993, we created an online magazine and catalog to celebrate the
       people who were making this new medium happen. Friday, October 11,
       13 It was originally a demonstration site for the power of the web
       - we installed kiosks in bookstores so people could experience the
       internet, but then we realized “It’s not a demo, it’s a product.”
       It was the ﬁrst web portal, and the ﬁrst site on the web to have
       advertising.
     * We ended up developing the business model for the web Friday,
       October 11, 13 GNN turned into a business - one that shaped the
       whole future of the web. We were the ﬁrst site to provide
       advertising on the web. But GNN started just as a way to celebrate
       the people of the web.
     * Lesson Three: “It's very hard getting communities formed. But if a
       community is already formed and it doesn't know it's a community,
       that's easy.”Brian Erwin Friday, October 11, 13 But there was
       another lesson I learned from Brian. In describing the early work
       he did to market the Whole Internet User’s Guide by harnessing
       online communities, he wrote:
     * Friday, October 11, 13 That was the playbook I put to work when, in
       1998, I organized a meeting that came to be called The Open Source
       Summit, because it was there that the leaders of most of the
       world’s most popular free software projects voted to use a new
       name, “open source software.” I realized that the subjects of most
       of my bestselling books were free software packages - and what’s
       more, while I knew the authors of all these packages, they didn’t
       all know each other. There were overlapping communities just
       waiting to be formed into a single super-community. You can see in
       the press release that we sent out announcing the event how much we
       focused on the people who created the programs that ran the
       internet.
     * The 1998 Open Source Summit Friday, October 11, 13 It was all about
       the people and their place in the story. When we held a press
       conference at the end of the day, I could say: “If your company has
       a domain name, it works because of the software written by that
       long haired guy at the end of the table. If you send an email,
       well, it’s routed by the software written by that guy there. If you
       have a web site, well, that’s the long haired guy at the other end
       of the table. And when you use a web browser, it was written by
       *that* guy...

     * Lesson Four: Language is a Map Friday, October 11, 13 There’s
       another big lesson from my open source activism. Language is a map.
       It describes the world. And if it does a good job describing the
       world, you can get where you want. But if it doesn’t, you can be
       led astray.
     * Words help us see and make sense of the world Alfalfa Orchard Grass
       Oat Grass Friday, October 11, 13 Let me explain what I mean very
       simply. When I first moved to Sebastopol, before I had horses, I’d
       look out at a meadow, and all I’d see was grass. But eventually, I
       got a language for what I was looking at, and could distinguish
       between alfalfa, oat grass, orchard grass, rye grass, and many
       more.
     * “The skill of writing is to create a context in which other people
       can think.” Edwin Schlossberg Friday, October 11, 13 So a lot of
       what I do in my work is to frame things in such a way that people
       can see them better. As Edwin Schlossberg once said:
     * Free Software Foundation Messaging Friday, October 11, 13 For
       example, look at the map that the Free Software Foundation was
       offering the world in 1998. Free software was about developing a
       “free” variant of the Unix operating system.
     * The “Open Source” Summit Friday, October 11, 13 Now let’s look back
       at that press release I sent out for the freeware summit. It was
       all about the Internet, and the role that various free software
       programs played in making it work. My message was that free
       software wasn’t some fringe thing out to destroy the software
       industry - it was at the heart of the next big software revolution,
       and that everyone was already relying on it!
     * Free Software “Meme Map” Friday, October 11, 13 Around 2002, I
       wrote a paper called “Remaking the Peer to Peer Meme.” In that
       paper, I used a diagram I called a “meme map” to show how I’d
       transformed the storytelling about free software into the
       storytelling about open source software. I know these are eye
       charts from here, and there’s no way you can read them now, but
       I’ll put the slides up on slideshare, and even better, you can go
       read the original paper.
       http://www.openp2p.com/pub/a/p2p/2000/12/05/book_ch01_meme.html
     * Open Source “Meme Map” Friday, October 11, 13 Here’s the
       corresponding version for Open Source.
     * O’Reilly’s strategic planning goal for 2003 “Reignite enthusiasm in
       the computer industry” Friday, October 11, 13 In 2003/2004, I was
       faced with a big problem. People had lost faith in the web after
       the dotcom bust. But I was more convinced than ever that something
       big was happening. I had to reignite enthusiasm. I did this, of
       course, by storytelling.
     * What do these things have in common? Friday, October 11, 13 You can
       see how once again, I framed the story as a movement with exemplars
       you could learn from. This is a slide from one of my talks in 2003.
     * Harnessing Collective Intelligence Data is the “Intel Inside”
       Friday, October 11, 13 My colleague Dale Dougherty coined the term
       Web 2.0 to distinguish the companies that survived the dot com bust
       from those that had gone down in ﬂames, and I told a big story
       about what made them different. Because these were powerful ideas
       that became clearer and clearer to everyone over time, the story
       had power, and it continued to have power long after the original
       “Web 2.0” meme had passed.

       those eye charts, this one for Web 2.0. From
       http://oreilly.com/web2/archive/what-is-web-20.html
     * “You can leave anything out, as long as you know what it is.” -
       Ernest Hemingway Friday, October 11, 13 They may seem like
       overkill, but it actually really helps to ﬂesh out your ideas. You
       want to simplify them down to bumper stickers eventually, but ﬁrst
       you want to make them deep and rich, thoughtful and accurate. Then,
       as Hemingway said, you can leave anything out, because you know
       what it is. (I actually ﬁrst learned this lesson from Frank
       Herbert, the author of Dune. I wrote a book about him when I was
       24, and during one interview, he said that at the end of Dune, he
       wanted to leave the reader “skidding out of the story” full of
       unanswered questions. Frank intentionally left stuff out, but he
       knew what it was.
     * Reinventing the Faire Low Tech Meets High Tech Friday, October 11,
       13 It’s important for your story to draw the right lines. Many of
       you are part of a movement that we named in 2005 with the launch of
       Make: magazine, and the 2006 launch of an event called Maker Faire,
       which you can think of as a kind of county fair with robots. There
       are artists and scientists among you who can call yourself “makers”
       and say something important about the overlap of art and science.
     * Maker Faire 2006 Friday, October 11, 13 One of my favorite
       juxtapositions of that ﬁrst Faire was between a booth for
       Swap-o-Rama-Rama, a clothing swap in which people remanufacture the
       clothes with the help of onsite designers, sewing machines, silk
       screens, etc, and put on a fashion show for each other at the end
       of the day, and the Alameda Contra Costa Computer Recycling
       Society, which was showing off their biodiesel powered
       supercomputer made from recycled PCs running Linux. It was a
       brilliant stroke by Dale Dougherty to build a tent big enough to
       include both crafts and the geekiest of high-tech. Drawing the
       right map of the world you want to create can make a huge
       difference.
     * Lesson Five: Change happens slowly... Then all at once Friday,
       October 11, 13 I still remember the early years of evangelizing the
       world wide web, or open source software, or the second coming of
       the web after the dot com bust. It was hard. Nobody believed us.
       But eventually, the world caught up. It was the same way with open
       source software. Or the maker movement. We started Make Magazine in
       2005. The startups and VCs didn’t show up till four or ﬁve years
       later. You are all on the cutting edge of world changing movements.
       Keep pushing, and the world will catch up.
     * Government as a platform Friday, October 11, 13 I’ve tried to put
       all these principles to work in my current crusade, to transform
       government. When everyone else was all excited about social media
       uptake by government, I told a deeper story, about what government
       could learn from the iPhone and the web about becoming a platform.
     * “The legitimate object of government is to do for the people what
       needs to be done, but which they cannot, by individual effort, do
       at all, or do so well, for themselves.” -Abraham Lincoln, July 1,
       1854 Friday, October 11, 13 My notion of government as a platform
       is rooted in the notion that government is, at bottom, a mechanism
       for collective action, a means for doing things that are best done
       together. So I was delighted recently to discover that Abraham
       Lincoln had said much the same thing 150 years ago. But this notion
       also suggests a level of restraint. The best government programs
       enable the private sector; they don’t compete with it. I hope that
       government follows this lead, that it enables, and to use Cass
       Sunstein and Richard Thaler’s notion, *nudges* the market in the
       right direction to produce socially beneﬁcial outcomes, but that it
       does so with a light hand. As the Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu said
       three thousand years ago, “When the best leader leads, the people
       say ‘We did it ourselves.’” **** Below, just for reference: Lincoln
       elsewhere pointed out: “The desirable things which the individuals
       of a people cannot do or cannot well do for themselves fall into
       two classes: those which have relation to wrongs and those which
       have not. Each of these branch off into an inﬁnite variety of
       subdivisions. The ﬁrst that in relation to wrongs embraces all
       crimes, misdemeanors, and non performance of contracts. The other
       embraces all which in its nature and without wrong requires
       combined action as public roads and highways public schools
       charities pauperism orphanage estates of the deceased and the
       machinery of government itself.”
     * Friday, October 11, 13 Jen Pahlka, my ﬁancee, started a nonproﬁt
       called Code for America to bring talent from the tech industry to
       work with local governments to build simple, beautiful and
       easy-to-use interfaces to government services and challenging
       government to reinvent the way it engages with citizens.
     * “We don’t want government to work like a Silicon Valley startup, we
       want it to work like the internet itself.” - Jennifer Pahlka,
       Friday, October 11, 13 But as Jen says, our goal isn’t to make
       government work...
     * Friday, October 11, 13 Jen started Code for America by quitting her
       job, and funding it with her credit card. She then gradually built
       support for the idea. By last year, Code for America was being
       copied by the White House, which launched a program based on Code
       for America, the Presidential Innovation Fellows, which brings
       startup teams into Federal agencies. They recruited Jen to come to
       the White House as Deputy CTO, to run this program and to set up
       some new programs yet to be announced.
     * “We’ve opened up huge amounts of government data to the American
       people, and put it on the Internet for free.... And what’s
       happening is entrepreneurs and business owners are now using that
       data -- the people’s data --to create jobs and solve problems that
       government can’t solve by itself or can’t do as efficiently.” -
       President Barack Obama Friday, October 11, 13 And then, Last month,
       when President Obama talked about his second term management
       agenda, open data, and its role in enabling private sector to build
       on government as a platform, was a key part of the message. I think
       I’m getting through :-)
     * Friday, October 11, 13 Health care is another area where today’s
       skills can be put to use working on stuff that really matters.
       Here’s a report I co-authored last year that covers some of my
       ideas on the subject. I don’t have time to go into all the details
       today, but the report is a free download.
       http://radar.oreilly.com/2012/08/data-health-care.html
     * Friday, October 11, 13 And there are also amazing entrepreneurial
       opportunities building companies that also solve interesting social
       problems. Jen Pahlka, who founded Code for America, wrote a blog
       post recently that summarized one of these opportunities, which
       we’ve been brainstorming recently. How do you reinvent the corner
       store so that it delivers what people really need, at affordable
       prices, in a walkable city?

       dega-2-0-a-business-for-healthy-walkable-cities
     * Friday, October 11, 13 These are the kinds of opportunities that
       we’re looking for at O’Reilly AlphaTech Ventures, our early stage
       venture ﬁrm. If you want to apply the principles I’ve outlined here
       to build a great business that also just happens to make the world
       a better place, we’d love to hear from you. plans@oatv.com
     * Lesson Six: Create More Value Than You Capture Friday, October 11,
       13 But in the end, you don’t have to go start a nonproﬁt to create
       value for society. Business is a huge value creator. Don’t just
       think about how much value you can create for yourself, your
       company, and your investors. Think about how much value you can
       create for your customers, your suppliers, your partners, and the
       world.
     * I call it “the big lie” of modern business Friday, October 11, 13
       There is this crazy idea, which has become the dominant ideology of
       modern capitalism over the past few decades, which says that the
       only responsibility of a company is to make money for its
       shareholders. Leaving aside the fact of excessive executive
       compensation as prima facie evidence that no big company really
       believes that principle, this notion misses the point that an
       economy is an ecosystem. If you take out more than you put back,
       the ecosystem degrades.
     * Friday, October 11, 13 The end game of this kind of value system is
       the ﬁnancial crisis of 2008, and headlines like these.
     * Looting "…the normal economics of maximizing economic value is
       replaced by the topsy-turvy economics of maximizing current
       extractable value, which tends to drive the firm's economic net
       worth deeply negative. Once owners have decided they can extract
       more from a firm by maximizing their present take, any action that
       allows them to extract more currently will be attractive--even if
       it causes a large reduction in the true economic net worth of the
       firm. A dollar in increased dividends today is worth a dollar to
       owners, but a dollar in increased future earnings is worth nothing
       because future payments accrue to the creditors who will be left
       holding the bag." George Akerlof and Paul Romer, Looting (1996)
       http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract-id=227162 Friday,
       October 11, 13 Economists George Akerlof and Paul Romer nailed this
       pathology in their 1996 paper on “moral hazard.” The paper was
       called Looting, and it’s endemic in not just the ﬁnancial industry,
       but increasingly throughout our economy, in which companies try to
       extract value rather than deliver it. A startup that thinks its
       business model begins with VC money and ends with a quick exit is
       working the same angle as the banks.
       http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract-id=227162
     * “There’s a wonderful section in Les Miserables about the good that
       Jean Valjean does as a businessman (operating under the pseudonym
       of Father Madeleine). Through his industry and vision, he makes an
       entire region prosperous, so that “there was no pocket so obscure
       that it had not a little money in it; no dwelling so lowly that
       there was not some little joy within it.” And the key point:
       “Father Madeleine made his fortune; but a singular thing in a
       simple man of business, it did not seem as though that were his
       chief care. He appeared to be thinking much of others, and little
       of himself.” Friday, October 11, 13 This is in sharp contrast to
       the vision of capitalism in this wonderful quote from Les
       Miserables, Victor Hugo’s wonderful, humane novel about social
       issues in 19th century France.
     * Friday, October 11, 13 This desire to build value for a community
       of stakeholders shapes companies like Etsy, AirBnb, and
       Kickstarter.
     * Friday, October 11, 13
     * Friday, October 11, 13
     * Friday, October 11, 13 This same desire to create value for a
       community of stakeholders animates Square. Jack saw this as an
       enabler for small business.
     * Friday, October 11, 13 Like Square, Uber has a focus on building
       value for stakeholders - every driver I talk to loves the service
       because it increases their utilization and thus their income. It’s
       a win-win all around. There are also some technology lessons from
       apps like square and uber that I wish I had time to share with you
       - but that’s a whole other talk. Uber shows us the principles of
       Software Above the Level of a Single Device, the use of sensors
       (both you and the driver have phones that know where you are), a
       data back end as part of the system, and “doing less.” Because your
       credit card is already on ﬁle, they’ve taken payment out of the
       workﬂow. And replaced it with reputation - they ask you to rate the
       driver, and the driver to rate the passenger. (See my talk at
       Stanford for these technology lessons:
       http://ecorner.stanford.edu/authorMaterialInfo.html?mid=3054 )
     * Lesson Seven: Work on What is Hard Friday, October 11, 13 There’s
       one other lesson I want to share with you. I still remember the
       early years of evangelizing the world wide web, or open source
       software, or the second coming of the web after the dot com bust.
       It was hard. Nobody believed me. But eventually, the world caught
       up. You are all on the cutting edge of world changing movements.
       Keep pushing, and the world will catch up.
     * Friday, October 11, 13 A great example of this is a company called
       Makani Power, founded by son-in-law Saul Griffith, which is
       building drone aircraft for high altitude wind farms. One of the
       early employees left a Wall Street hedge fund not because he
       thought he’d make more money, but because, as he said, “the math is
       harder and more interesting.”
     * What we fight with is so small. And when we win, it makes us small.
       This is how we grow: by being defeated, decisively, by
       progressively greater beings. (Paraphrase of “The Man Watching,” by
       Rainer Maria Rilke) Friday, October 11, 13 I gave a talk at my
       Emerging Technologies Conference in 2008 entitled, “Why I love
       hackers.” My son-in-law Saul Griffith was the next speaker, and I
       knew he’d be talking about Makani and his vision of solving the
       world’s energy problems. And I had just returned from a trip to
       Sicily, and had been inspired by stories of Archimedes, one of
       history’s great hackers. Hackers work on what is hard. They don’t
       do the obvious. And they don’t do it because they are focused on
       some short term reward. I ended with this advice from Rainer Maria
       Rilke’s poem, The Man Watching. He describes how Jacob and the
       other wrestlers of the Old Testament used to do battle with angels.
       They had no hope of winning, but they were strengthened by the
       ﬁght. Rilke goes on to say, “Winning does not tempt that man. What
       we ﬁght with is so small, and when we win, it makes us small. What
       we want is to be defeated, decisively, by progressively greater
       beings.” So, relish your challenges, and keep picking big ﬁghts.
       Thank you very much.
