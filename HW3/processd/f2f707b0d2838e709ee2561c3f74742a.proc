The City as a Platform - Stripping out complexity and Making Things Happen

   02/14/2014

   2 Comments

   The concept of data platforms has garnered a lot of coverage over the
   past few years and the City as a Platform is one that has wide traction
   in the “Smart City” space. It’s an idea that has been widely
   promulgated by service integrators and large consultancy firms. This
   idea has been adopted into the thinking of many cities in the UK,
   increasingly by local authorities who have both been forced by central
   government diktat to open their data and who are also engaging with
   many of the large private companies who sell infrastructure and
   capabilities and with whom they may have existing contractual
   arrangements.
   Standard interpretations of city as platform usually involve the idea
   that the city authority will create the platform into which it will
   release its data. It then seeks the integration of API’s (both external
   and internal) into the platform so that theoretically the user can
   access that data via a unified City API on which developers can then
   create products and services.
   Picture
   Some local authorities seek to monetise access to this API while others
   see it as a mechanism for encouraging the development of new products
   and services that are of value to the state but which have been
   developed without direct additional investment by the state thereby
   generating public good from the public task of collecting and storing
   data.
   This concept of city as platform integrated by local authorities
   appears at first glance to be a logical, linear and achievable goal but
   in my view completely misunderstands a number of key factors;
   1. The evolution of the open data/big data market
   2. Commercial and Technical realities
   3. Governance and bureaucracy
   I’ll explore these below.
   The London Datastore is often referred to as a city platform and it has
   certainly been recognised as a success in terms of outcomes - the wide
   deployment of various apps such as travel apps which reduce friction
   for commuters and are spawning a whole new ecosystem of SME’s in
   London. The visualisation of data which has assisted the academic and
   research community. The publication of crime data which allows citizens
   better understand the challenges facing their areas and the integration
   of data across different boroughs which gives a London wide
   perspective. The City Dashboard created by CASA in UCL is a great
   example of what can be done when a city releases its data.
   Picture
   But the London Datastore is not a platform. It is a website to which
   static datasets can be uploaded. For most authorities and certainly for
   the GLA itself its largest data asset base are static files (usually
   CSV) which require little technical resource to publish. It is worth
   noting that the cost of the London Datastore was circa £16,000 and no
   additional staff were recruited to the GLA for the scoping, development
   and deployment of the London Datastore (apart from some developer days
   which were paid to hire a developer to build the website in Drupal).
   The code for the website is open source and can be freely reused by
   anyone who wanted to replicate it in their own city. Nor did this take
   time once the political commitment had been made. The project started
   scoping in October 2009 and launched on the 5th January 2010 with 50
   datasets and a further 150 datasets were published to the website by
   the end of January 2010.
   No additional technical training was required for the Data Management
   Asset Group (GIS and statistical staff) who simply uploaded the
   datasets as part of business as usual. So the first steps are simple,
   easily achieved and have no technical barriers. That’s iteration one of
   open data for a city and that’s achievable in a few short months - not
   years.
   Had the London Datastore tried to adopt the platform model (as opposed
   to the website model) then it would have been impossible to achieve
   this early start. By the time the London Datastore launched, TfL, for
   example, were not in a position to confirm how they would release their
   data, how the API would be configured for data feeds and it took some
   months for them to open up the access to real time data. When that
   happened the London Datastore did not seek to integrate their API into
   the Datastore it simply “pointed” to the real time feeds and timetables
   which could be downloaded by the developers directly from the TfL
   developer portal.
   The advantage to pointing to the real time data feeds for London and
   for City Hall is that it would be impossible for City Hall to provide
   service level agreements to the developer community on its API.
   Integrating different data sources from external bodies is complicated
   to the degree that different sources can have different licensing
   models. While open standards and policies are important they are not
   always clearly worked out. A centralised city API would have put the
   responsibility for the data delivery at the feet of City Hall and not
   at the feet of the data providers themselves who have robust monitoring
   and delivery mechanism with 24/7 service.
   Put simply if I am a developer or small SME building a product or
   service on a centralised API and something happens to that city API at
   11.00 on a Saturday night - will the local authority be able to
   respond? Will it offer 24/7 services? Does it have the in-house
   technical capability to act in an agile manner? It’s not been my
   experience as a former local authority official that this is how local
   authority technical teams are constructed.
   Static data sets are rarely updated at the rate of churn of real time
   data. Most are updated quarterly or even annually in some cases, so the
   service provision to the technologist is radically different in this
   context. The wrong number on a spreadsheet of say environmental data is
   not going to cause the same difficulty to a product or service in terms
   of time needed to correct - its not likely to knock out an app that
   over half a million people have downloaded and depend on for their
   travel information on a daily basis.
   Picture
   The London Datastore was and is both a website and a leadership
   function using the Mayoral authority to bring other public sector
   providers into the open data space. It’s leadership paved the way and
   the centralised location for the data (on the surface) makes it LOOK
   like a platform but the technical and commercial reality is that it is
   a federation of its own datasets and links which hopefully makes the
   user journey for the developer a little more easy to navigate. It also
   acted as a broker between developers and technologists helping them
   navigate their way through large bureaucratic structures because that
   is what public officials are good at and technologists shouldn’t have
   to be.
   Since the evolution of the London Datastore there are easier ways to do
   things and a data market is emerging with vastly lower costs often
   payable on a subscription basis. There are many small SME’s operating
   in the open data space who operate at vastly lower costs than large
   system integrators can offer. This is precisely the SME market and
   economic stimulus that was behind the Mayoral initiative in London and
   should be happening in cities throughout the UK. Open the data and let
   1,000 flowers bloom and over time SME’s will emerge into credible and
   solid open data service providers.
   I declare an interest here with my startup TransportAPI which has six
   people but now, as a data aggregator for public transport, is providing
   all of Heathrow Airports public transport data. It is also providing
   data to Transport for London and Network Rail. The difference between
   taking data from a city api and from a transport aggregator like
   TransportAPI is that we offer data as a service - we clean up and
   stabilise data, we monitor the service, we have clear and open service
   level agreements that offer discount on down times and that provide
   value added services. This is what has evolved in the market through
   the London Datastore initiative. The city does not need to provide the
   API itself - it needs to bring its datasets (static and simple) to the
   market and then let the market evolve new business models.
   It is the service level that is required that is so completely
   forgotten in the current debate around City as a Platform. You can
   build a product or service in an experimental way on the cityAPI you
   can bring your product to proof of concept - but you cannot scale on an
   API that does not have ongoing and 24/7 service provision and you have
   to provide that service at a cost that recognises the price point that
   the market can bear.
   If you are hoping to sell an app for £1.69 you have to sell a hell of a
   lot of them to make a business and every penny spent on a service that
   a large company or the city could provide is going to kill your route
   to market.
   So in a few easy steps here is what local authorities in cities need to
   do:
   1. Do it - release what you have in machine readable form on an open
   source website with clear policies on reuse. If you don’t know what
   they are then talk to the Open Data Institute.
   2. Do more - get any public bodies with whom you have a relationship in
   the public sector to upload their static data in machine readable
   form.
   3. Do even more - use your authority as a city leader to encourage
   anyone in the data market (transport authorities, utility companies) to
   join your ecosystem. Convince them of the benefit to the city and the
   citizen and then use your website to point to their open API’s.
   Familiarise yourself with all of the new providers who have come into
   the ecosystem and who can provide agile and cost effective products and
   services.
   4. Stop using outsourced IT as an excuse. If you have outsourced your
   IT then make a distinction between digital/data and IT. IT is kit and
   tin - data is digital and yours. And if that does not work make it
   clear to your supplier that their intransigence and crippling contracts
   are a poor offering for your citizens and that when it comes to the
   next contract negotiation you will be seeking out SME’s who can do this
   really well and for a fraction of the cost with better results for your
   citizens.
   That’s it really. It’s not hard, its not resource intensive and it
   doesn't cost a lot of money. I’ve seen figures of up to £200,000 for
   Data Platforms but if you follow the model suggested above you can
   build a really nice open source website to start and get the ball
   rolling for a maximum of £20,000 (and that’s being really generous and
   allowing for some nice design). Probably less because in the end
   technologists don’t really care what the site looks like they just want
   the data.
   Update: Since publishing Tim O'Reilly sums it up very nicely in his
   response

     @emercoleman Love what you wrote. But I think both are platforms.
     One is prematurely overspecified, the other is an MVP, and will
     evolve.

   Excellent post Emer, thanks for this.
   In Birmingham a few of us are taking a different approach to the issue
   you outline in step 4. The intransigence of our local IT service
   provider has meant a delay of months, if not years, in the release of a
   Birmingham Datastore.
   Amongst the activities we have planned for <a href =
   "http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/the-data-day-open-data-day-in-birmingham
   -registration-10440330309">next Saturday's Open Data Day</a> is the
   creation of "A Datastore in a Day". By the end of the day we intend to
   have an instance of Ckan running, with some examples of open data both
   on it and linked to from it.
   We'll also be encouraging people to make Freedom of Information
   requests for the datasets they are most interested in. The responses
   will be loaded onto the datastore over the following month, further
   demonstrating that it really isn't all that difficult to do.
   I doubt that it will be pretty, but it'll be a start....
   What we might not use is the hashtag you've got in the City Dashboard
   image in your post!
   All the best
   Simon
