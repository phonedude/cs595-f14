   ----------------------

   If you need financial support for attending the Civic Design Camp,
   please let us know. Scholarships available on an as-needed basis.

ï»¿We are gathering to improve design in government, join us!

   The first-ever Civic Design Camp on April 12 is a one-day gathering of
   practicing designers of all stripes with local government officials
   interested in using design to improve the services they provide to
   citizens. Partly structured session format for skill shares and case
   studies, and partly unconference format for free exchange of ideas and
   challenges, the day will cover topics ranging from user research to
   service design to citizen engagement. The camp's 100-125 attendees will
   be approximately half from government and half from industry; the goal
   is to create connections, share knowledge, and strengthen the emerging
   movement dedicated to creating better citizen experiences.

Schedule

   Please join us the night before on Friday, April 11th from 5:30 to 7
   for a happy hour at Code for America HQ (same address as the camp)

Civic Design Tracks

   There will be four "tracks" of discussion and activity throughout the
   day:
   1. Case studies. Share your stories of civic design projects you have
   been part of: what worked, what didn't, what might come next.
   Ten-minute "lightning talks" are welcome!
   2. Big questions. Group discussions on the most important issues in
   civic design - as determined by you!
   3. Skill shares. Learn, or teach, the basic tools and methods of civic
   design in in-depth workshops.
   4. Hack sessions. Form a team, roll up your sleeves and get working on
   a civic design challenge that inspires you.
