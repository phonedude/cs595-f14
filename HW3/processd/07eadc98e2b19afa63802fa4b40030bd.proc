   Published on May 23, 2014

   From the 2014 Solid Conference: It's easy to talk about "the Internet
   of Things" and to miss the bigger pattern: we are no longer just
   building software for individual devices, but creating networks of
   intelligence and action that make it possible to completely rethink how
   we organize work, play, and society itself. As Aaron Levie of Box.net
   wrote on Twitter: "Uber is a $3.5 billion lesson in building for how
   the world should work instead of optimizing for how the world does
   work." Once both driver and potential passengers were instrumented with
   devices reporting their location in real time, it became possible to
   completely rethink urban transportation. How much more will that be
   true with self-driving cars? Similarly, when GE designs jet engines
   that report when they need maintenance, the notion of the "maintenance
   schedule" goes out the window. And whither jet engines, so too the
   human body. Manufacturing, logistics, transportation, healthcare: these
   are all ripe for the "Solid revolution." That revolution isn't just
   about designing smart stuff, and dumb stuff that can be built with
   smart tools, it's about designing software and systems above the level
   of a single device, software that completely transforms industries.
   This is a time for the most prodigious feats of imagination, applying
   hardware, software, big data, sociology, and creativity to redesign
   processes and institutions, not just things.
