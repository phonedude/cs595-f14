   What did Sundar Pichai do, that his peers didn't do, that got him
   promoted up to the highest ranks at Google?
   When he started he reported to Marissa Mayer. In time he was promoted
   above her. Now he reports directly to Larry Page as Senior Vice
   President of Chrome, Android and Apps.
   How did Sundar make the kind of impact that made him stand out above
   his peers?
   There are lots of people at Google who work hard. Did Sundar work
   harder than his peers?
   There are lots of people at Google who work smart. Did Sundar work
   smarter than his peers? If so, what is his paradigm that is smarter?
   There are lots of super smart people at Google. Is Sundar innately
   smarter than them?

   I never reported to Sundar or in his group, but many of my peers and
   friends did. Besides being incredibly talented and hardworking like
   many of his coworkers and peers, Sundar did a few things:
    1. Foremost: he led successful efforts for difficult projects that
       were core to Google's continued financial success, namely Toolbar
       and Chrome. Toolbar wasn't an obviously sexy product but it helped
       defend the presence of Google search on users' computers during a
       critical period following the revelation of Google's incredible
       profitability. Chrome extended that mission to improve the user
       experience of the entire web: keep users on the web and you'll keep
       them searching on Google.
    2. He recruited, mentored, and retained a great team. Sundar's team of
       product managers had a reputation as being among the best of the
       best, similar to the reputation of the software engineers within
       Search Quality.
    3. He avoided making enemies. Google has politics like any other large
       company, and Sundar navigated those politics to make his team
       successful while inflicting the least possible damage on any other
       team.

   Success at Google (and in the world in general) isn't just about how
   smart you are - you don't get promoted simply because you measure on
   some linear scale higher than someone else. Hard work is necessary, as
   is being a quick learner, if you want to scale the ladder at Google,
   but the only thing that can really catalyze the whole process is the
   right opportunity. One of the other answers touches on this - Sundar
   Pichai was in the right place to have an enormous impact at Google.
   Would other individuals have done just as well? Probably, as you
   mentioned Google is full of talented folks, but we simply don't have
   the counterfactual - of what would have happened to their career if
   someone else led the efforts Pichai did.
   In general, as exceptional as certain individuals are, they are the
   product of circumstances far greater than themselves.

   What isn't addressed here, and always plays a role in advancement is
   this: the perceived value of you and your contributions. It doesn't
   matter if its Google, IBM or an incubator project.
   Those with the means and authority to advance the careers of their
   subordinates differ in how they perceive and prioritize value...we all
   do...not just across companies but across departments and
   organizational layers.
   For some, advancement is accidental -- the result of unsolicited
   recognition for their performance. For others, it's a pursuit --
   becoming adept at identifying and understanding your manager's
   perception of value, then delivering on that value and more. Rinse and
   repeat as you work your way up the ranks.

   I'll take a stab at this one in a general sense:
   He busted ass.  People always wonder how someone does something like
   there's some secret sauce that everyone's missing. This is a myth.
   Great accomplishments come through great effort.

   Although I'm not qualified to say anything about internal politics at
   Google, I definitely liked a previous answer for the Michelangelo
   quote, ("If people knew how hard I had worked, it would not seem so
   wonderful at all") and support in spirit the idea that we all tend to
   underestimate the sheer volume of practice and work that the "greats"
   are doing and number of sacrifices that they are making through their
   single-mindedness, and ascribe it instead to "secret sauce."
   But then, moving up an organizational ladder is different than becoming
   a masterful painter for the ages. Isn't it? Does climbing the ladder at
   Google require more "luck" than becoming a Michelangelo? Such luck as
   more chance meetings for example, and educational opportunities, etc.
   "Who you know." Who likes you. Does becoming a great
   painter/sculptor/architect require less "luck" and more "effort, skill,
   dedication" than becoming a top Googler?
   I'm tempted to think the painter is less "luck"-based. But then, was
   Michelangelo "lucky" to have the temperament, era, teachers, location
   to grow into the artist he became. To grow up around the most beautiful
   marble quarries in the known world? Yes, certainly he was, if "luck" is
   the fortuitous confluence of factors outside of personal control.
   And Sundar Pichai, though I know nothing about him, must have great
   devotion, intelligence, skill, and networking to achieve such a coveted
   position. Ignore all luck, the guy must still have "something" akin to
   what Michelangelo had. But channelled in a different direction, to suit
   a different temperament and era?
   Would both Michelangelo and Mr. Pichai succeed in SOME field, in ANY
   era, and ANY time and circumstance, born to any family?
   Who knows?
   Solution: I should put my nose back to the grindstone this morning and
   get off Quora until after dinner. And maybe I'll know the answer myself
   someday :)

   The last time I quit heroin , I went cold turkey on a friends couch. It
   wasn't really planned but it happened something like this.
   I was living with some junkie in her parents house. Her parents were
   both coke heads and they knew I was doing heroin but they had a 'no
   needles' policy so when they found out we were shooting up, they
   "politely asked me to leave." I was left with very little money...
