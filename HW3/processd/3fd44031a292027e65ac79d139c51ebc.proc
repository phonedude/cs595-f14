   Enceladus Rains Water Onto Saturn


      Enceladus Rains Water Onto Saturn

               Enceladus

   Water plumes shoot from Enceladus.

      ESA's Herschel space observatory has shown that water expelled from the
      moon Enceladus forms a giant torus of water vapour around Saturn. The
      discovery solves a 14-year mystery by identifying the source of the
      water in Saturn's upper atmosphere.

      Herschel's latest results mean that Enceladus is the only moon in the
      Solar System known to influence the chemical composition of its parent
      planet.

      Enceladus expels around 250 kg of water vapour every second, through a
      collection of jets from the south polar region known as the Tiger
      Stripes because of their distinctive surface markings.

      These crucial observations reveal that the water creates a
      doughnut-shaped torus of vapour surrounding the ringed planet.

      The total width of the torus is more than 10 times the radius of
      Saturn, yet it is only about one Saturn radius thick. Enceladus orbits
      the planet at a distance of about four Saturn radii, replenishing the
      torus with its jets of water.

      Despite its enormous size, it has escaped detection until now because
      water vapour is transparent to visible light but not at the infrared
      wavelengths Herschel was designed to see.

      Saturn's atmosphere is known to contain traces of gaseous water in its
      deeper layers. A particular enigma has been the presence of water in
      its upper atmosphere.

      First reported in 1997 by teams using ESA's Infrared Space Observatory,
      the source of this water was unknown until now. Computer models of
      these latest Herschel observations show that about 3-5% of the water
      expelled by Enceladus ends up falling into Saturn.

      "There is no analogy to this behaviour on Earth," says Paul Hartogh,
      Max-Planck-Institut für Sonnensystemforschung, Katlenburg-Lindau,
      Germany, who led the collaboration on the analysis of these results.

      "No significant quantities of water enter our atmosphere from space.
      This is unique to Saturn."

      Although most of the water from Enceladus is lost into space, freezes
      on the rings or perhaps falls onto Saturn's other moons, the small
      fraction that does fall into the planet is sufficient to explain the
      water observed in its upper atmosphere.

      It is also responsible for the production of additional oxygen-bearing
      compounds, such as carbon dioxide.

      Ultimately, water in Saturn's upper atmosphere is transported to lower
      levels, where it will condense but the amounts are so tiny that the
      resulting clouds are not observable.

      "Herschel has proved its worth again. These are observations that only
      Herschel can make," says Göran Pilbratt, ESA Herschel Project
      Scientist.

      "ESA's Infrared Space Observatory found the water vapour in Saturn's
      atmosphere. Then NASA/ESA's Cassini/Huygens mission found the jets of
      Enceladus. Now Herschel has shown how to fit all these observations
      together."
