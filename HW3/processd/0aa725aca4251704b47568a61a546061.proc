   Published on May 22, 2014

   From the 2014 Solid Conference: Robotics is an emerging technology with
   a lot of confusion. As a student of human-robot culture and now the
   manager of the tech cluster for robotics in Silicon Valley, Andra Keay
   sees both the popular culture and the real world of research, startups
   and industry. Sometimes there is a gaping chasm between them. Andra's
   role is to help robotics cross that chasm, and on the way, perhaps also
   to help robotics to be more useful for more people.
   About Andra Keay (Silicon Valley Robotics)
   Andra Keay is a human systems engineer, Founder of Robot Launchpad,
   Managing Director of Silicon Valley Robotics and CoFounder of Robot
   Garden, a new robotics hackerspace. Andra is also Treasurer of the
   Robots Association and contributor to Robohub, the global site for news
   and views on robotics. She obtained her MA in Human-Robot
   Culture/Cultural Theory at the University of Sydney, Australia in 2011,
   building on a background as a robot hobbyist, STEM educator and
   film-maker.
