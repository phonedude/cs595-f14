                                              Combat Troops Inside Ukraine

   Mons, BELGIUM – NATO released new satellite images on Thursday, 28
   August 2014, that show Russian combat forces engaged in military
   operations inside the sovereign territory of Ukraine. The images,
   captured in late August, depict Russian self-propelled artillery units
   moving in a convoy through the Ukrainian countryside and then preparing
   for action by establishing firing positions in the area of Krasnodon,
   Ukraine.
   Dutch Brigadier General Nico Tak, director of the Comprehensive Crisis
   and Operations Management Centre (CCOMC), Allied Command Operations
   said the images confirmed what NATO and its Allies had been seeing for
   weeks from other sources.
   "Over the past two weeks we have noted a significant escalation in both
   the level and sophistication of Russia’s military interference in
   Ukraine,” said Brigadier General Tak. "The satellite images released
   today provide additional evidence that Russian combat soldiers,
   equipped with sophisticated heavy weaponry, are operating inside
   Ukraine’s sovereign territory,” he said.
   These latest images provide concrete examples of Russian activity
   inside Ukraine, but are only the tip of the iceberg in terms of the
   overall scope of Russian troop and weapons movements.
   "We have also detected large quantities of advanced weapons, including
   air defence systems, artillery, tanks, and armoured personnel carriers
   being transferred to separatist forces in Eastern Ukraine,” said
   Brigadier General Tak. "The presence of these weapons along with
   substantial numbers of Russian combat troops inside Ukraine make the
   situation increasingly grave,” he said.
   Also released were images showing substantial activity inside Russia in
   areas adjacent to the border with Ukraine. NATO believes this activity
   is being conducted in direct support to forces operating inside
   Ukraine, and is part of a highly coordinated and destabilising
   strategy.
   "Russia is reinforcing and resupplying separatist forces in a blatant
   attempt to change the momentum of the fighting, which is currently
   favouring the Ukrainian military," Brigadier General Tak said.
   "Russia's ultimate aim is to alleviate pressure on separatist fighters
   in order to prolong this conflict indefinitely, which would result in
   further tragedy for the people of Eastern Ukraine," he added.
   The source of the images is an independent firm named Digital Globe.
   The images have not been altered or changed by NATO. Additional
   information has been added to identify locations, dates and equipment.

   Release of Satellite Imagery - 28 August 2014

                     Image #1 provided by Digital Globe
   Image 1 shows Russian military units moving in a convoy formation with
   self-propelled artillery in the area of Krasnodon, Ukraine, well inside
   territory controlled by Russian separatists. The image was captured on
   21 August 2014. There is confidence the equipment is Russian, since
   Ukrainian units have not yet penetrated this far into separatist
   controlled territory.



                     Image #2 provided by Digital Globe
   Image 2 shows Russian self-propelled artillery units set up in firing
   positions near Krasnodon, Ukraine. They are supported by logistical
   vehicles which are likely carrying extra ammunition and supplies. This
   configuration is exactly how trained military professionals would
   arrange their assets on the ground, indicating that these are not
   unskilled amateurs, but Russian soldiers. Russian artillery systems
   like these have recently shelled Ukrainian positions outside the city
   of Luhansk in conjunction with a separatist counteroffensive to attempt
   to break the Ukrainian siege of the city.

                     Image #3 provided by Digital Globe
   Image 3 includes two pictures (left and right) and shows a military
   deployment site on the Russian side of the border, near Rostov-on-Don.
   This location is approximately 31 miles or 50 kilometres from the
   Dovzhansky, Ukraine border crossing.

   The image on the left was captured on 19 June 2014 and shows the area
   to be mostly empty at this time. The image on the right was taken two
   months later on 20 August 2014 and shows the same location. Russian
   main battle tanks, armored personnel carriers, cargo trucks and tented
   accommodations can all be clearly seen. This is one example of the
   multiple encampments that Russia has positioned near its border with
   Eastern Ukraine. Many of these forces are deployed within a few
   kilometers of Ukraine, and are capable of attacking with little
   warning, and could potentially overwhelm and push-back Ukrainian units.
   Russia has also moved significant numbers of combat aircraft and
   helicopters to airfields along the border. Russian unmanned aircraft
   routinely cross into Ukrainian airspace.

   Some equipment from these locations is moved across the border and is
   used to resupply and equip separatist forces operating in Ukraine. For
   months, Russia has provided separatist fighters with heavy equipment in
   the form of tanks, armored vehicles, artillery, and multiple rocket
   launchers. Air defense systems have also been provided to separatists,
   even following the downing of Malaysian airlines flight MH17.

   Image #4 provided by Digital Globe
   Image 4, captured on 23 July 2014, depicts what are probably six
   Russian 153mm 2S19 self-propelled guns located in Russia near
   Kuybyshevo. This site is situated 4 miles, or 6.5 kilometres, south of
   the Ukraine border, near the village of Chervonyi Zhovten. The guns are
   pointed north, directly towards Ukrainian territory (see North
   indicator on image). See image 5 for an overview of where these guns
   are situated in relation to Ukrainian territory.

                     Image #5 provided by Digital Globe
   Image 5 shows a wider overview including the position of the
   self-propelled guns from image 4. Note the North indicator on this
   image, and remember that the guns are orientated in this location. It
   is clear that from this location, it would be impossible NOT to fire
   into Ukrainian territory. This is clearly NOT an exercise; these guns
   are being used to support separatist forces operating in the territory
   of Ukraine.
