Politics and the Digital world

   [placeholder.png]

Tim O'Reilly reflects in his article "Code Red_: “They have no use for
someone who looks and dresses like me”" on the Code Red_ article by Steven
Brill, which was published in the Time Magazine on March 10th 2014. I haven't
actually read the original article about the rescue of the US healthcare.gov
website. Yet, I am intrigued by the reflections O'Reilly has on the general
topic of introducing technological leaders into government.<br/><br/>"The
UK’s Tom Steinberg put it perfectly: the elites study politics, philosophy,
economics, and law while failing to recognize that you can no longer run a
country without a fundamental understanding of technology."<br/><br/>In
O'Reilly's opinion we should start preparing today's societies for the
technological changes happening everyday by making digital leaders also
decision makers in politics. He says "We celebrate startups all the time that
disrupt established industries. We celebrate innovation in big companies. Why
would we not celebrate people who are working to disrupt government “business
as usual” and make things better for all of us?". He proposes to use more
agile management styles, known and used in IT for years, instead of sticking
to traditional waterfall methodologies that make it hard to adapt to quick
changes.<br/><br/>Mike Bracken is quoted saying that “The second policy fact
is that when it comes to digital strategy, and technology related issues in
general, the absence of knowledgeable input from those delivering services is
alarming. ... the policymaking process in general [is] ... insufficiently
informed by practical experience.”<br/><br/>Sad but true, this doesn't only
apply to the US, UK or elsewhere. It is a general issue that most democracies
share nowadays: a lack of understanding the influence and importance of the
digital world by those making the decisions. We need innovative techies who
are willing to take the next step and push our governments into the digital
realm.<br/><br/>More
