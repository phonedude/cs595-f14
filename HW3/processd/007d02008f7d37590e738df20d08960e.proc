   From a grocery store parking lot in Tucson, AZ to a movie theater in
   Aurora, Colorado. From a teenager named Trayvon Martin to the children
   of Sandy Hook Elementary. The narrative about gun violence in America
   has changed, and grassroots supporters are organizing online to save
   lives and keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people.
   But how do you disrupt conventional wisdom and take on the best funded
   and most intimidating opponent in Washington -- the gun lobby?
   Three groups have been leading this charge: Mayor Michael Bloombergâ€™s
   coalition of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, Gabby Giffords and Mark
   Kellyâ€™s Americans for Responsible Solutions, and the concerned parents
   of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America.
   Hear their strategies for digital engagement and how theyâ€™re empowering
   ordinary people to help change state and federal laws and save lives.
