The Benefits of a Classical Education

   by Tim O'Reilly | @timoreilly | +Tim O'Reilly | June 21, 2009

   As some of you may know, I got my undergraduate degree in Greek and
   Latin Classics. So when Forbes asked me to do an interview on the
   subject of how my Classical education had affected my business career,
   I agreed. The result, part of a special report called Power, Ambition,
   Glory, used only a small part of the interview I provided, so I decided
   to publish the entire interview here. Questions in bold were provided
   by Forbes in an email interview:

   1. Tell us about a time when lessons learned from the ancients
   contributed to your success.

   I love this question. As John Cowper Powys noted in The Meaning of
   Culture, culture (vs. mere education) is how you put what you’ve
   learned to work in your own life, seeing the world around you more
   deeply because of the historical, literary, artistic and philosophical
   resonances that current experiences evoke. Classical stories come often
   to my mind, and provide guides to action (much as Plutarch intended his
   histories of famous men to be guides to morality and action). The
   classics are part of my mental toolset, the context I think with. So
   rather than giving you a single example, let me give you a potpourri.
     * The unconscious often knows more than the conscious mind. I believe
       this is behind what Socrates referred to as his inner “daimon” or
       guiding spirit. He had developed the skill of listening to that
       inner spirit. I have tried to develop that same skill. It often
       means not getting stuck in your fixed ideas, but recognizing when
       you need more information, and putting yourself into a receptive
       mode so that you can see the world afresh.
       This skill has helped me to reframe big ideas in the computer
       industry, including creating the first advertising on the world
       wide web, bringing the group together that gave open source
       software its name, and framing the idea that “Web 2.0″ or the
       “internet as platform” is really about building systems that
       harness collective intelligence, and get better the more people use
       them. Socrates is my constant companions (along with others, from
       Lao Tzu to Alfred Korzybski to George Simon, who taught me how to
       listen to my inner daimon.)
       I believe that I’ve consistently been able to spot emerging trends
       because I don’t think with what psychologist Eugene Gendlin called
       “received knowledge,” but in a process that begins with a raw data
       stream that over time tells me its own story.
       I wrote about this idea in my Classics honors thesis at Harvard.
       The ostensible subject was mysticism vs logic in the work of Plato,
       but the real subject was how we mistake the nature of thought. As
       Korzybski pointed out in the 1930s, “the map is not the territory,”
       yet so many of us walk around with our eyes glued to the map, and
       never notice when the underlying territory doesn’t match, or has
       changed. Socrates was one of my teachers in learning how not to get
       stuck following someone else’s map.
     * When Alexander the Great came to see Diogenes in his barrel, he was
       so impressed by the philosopher that he offered him money. Diogenes
       scornfully pointed out that he had no need of money, to which
       Alexander replied, “Have you no friends?” I’ve always thought that
       Alexander had the better of this encounter. His awareness that even
       when your own needs have been met you can work for the betterment
       of others has helped me to understand that being a successful
       businessman can be a powerful way to contribute to society. In
       building a business, it’s important to remember that you aren’t
       just acquiring wealth for yourself, but creating value for your
       employees, your customers, and others whom you may never even meet.
       This is the principle behind one of the mottos we use at O’Reilly:
       “Create more value than you capture.”
       Of course, the lessons for this one aren’t just from the Classics
       but from all of literature. I’m mindful of a wonderful passage in
       Victor Hugo’s Les Miserables about the good that Jean Valjean does
       as a businessman (operating under the pseudonym of Father
       Madeleine). Through his industry and vision, he makes an entire
       region prosperous, so that “there was no pocket so obscure that it
       had not a little money in it; no dwelling so lowly that there was
       not some little joy within it.” And the key point:
       “Father Madeleine made his fortune; but a singular thing in a
       simple man of business, it did not seem as though that were his
       chief care. He appeared to be thinking much of others, and little
       of himself.”
     * I’ve been deeply influenced by Aristotle’s idea that virtue is a
       habit, something you practice and get better at, rather than
       something that comes naturally. “The control of the appetites by
       right reason,” is how he defined it. My brother James once
       brilliantly reframed this as “Virtue is knowing what you really
       want,” and then building the intellectual and moral muscle to go
       after it.
     * There are many topics, from open source software to web 2.0, where
       I’ve had to spend years trying to persuade others to a point of
       view that was at first foreign, then popular, then misunderstood
       and bastardized by those seeking to profit from the term without
       really understanding it. In telling the same story over and over
       again in different ways, I’m following in the footsteps of the
       Greek orator (alas, I forget his name) who said “The difference
       between a man and a sheep is that a sheep just bleats, but a man
       keeps saying the same thing in different ways until he gets what he
       wants.”) Look at a series of essays like Hardware, Software, and
       Infoware, The Open Source Paradigm Shift, and What is Web 2.0? and
       you’ll see me pursuing the same ideas, refining, clarifying, and
       advocating till I get what I want.
     * I live with a constant consciousness of the decline and fall of the
       Roman Republic, and the alarming parallels to 20th and 21st century
       America. Today’s venal partisan politics, driven by self-interested
       lobbyists, who all too often put personal gain ahead of the real
       interests of the nation, is eerily reminiscent of the way Rome fell
       from its high ideals. Heck, we’re even replacing our military with
       mercenaries, one of the things that had disastrous consequences for
       Rome. Fortunately, we’re still early in the process, and there is
       an opportunity to turn it around.
       There are of course also other parallels – many of which have been
       noted by the classically trained among our politicians. Robert
       Byrd’s masterful retelling of the disastrous Athenian invasion of
       Syracuse (which ultimately led to their defeat in the Pelopponesian
       wars) highlighted the parallels with the US invasion of Iraq, and
       made clear that, as Mark Twain said, “While history doesn’t repeat
       itself, it does rhyme.”

   2. If you could invite one classical figure to dinner, who would it be
   and why?

   It would have to be Socrates, if only to know if he was indeed, as
   Plato said, “the noblest and best man ever to have lived” or rough clay
   refined by Plato’s own imagination. I like to think he’d be a great guy
   to have around to ask the right questions of those in power today. We’d
   probably imprison him too, though!

   3. Who is the most powerful person in your life?

   My wife Christina. She’s got a deep moral compass and a kind of
   intuitive sense of what matters. In our early years together, she had
   worries about me getting sucked too far into the competitive world of
   business, perhaps forgetting what is important. In so many ways, the
   kind of business I’ve built, which focuses on creating value for
   society and not just for the shareholders, is a reflection of my desire
   to build something she’d be proud of. I’m glad that I seem to have
   succeeded.

   4. What is your secret ambition?

   I’d love to have the time to learn to sing opera properly rather than
   bellowing half-formed fragments of melody in exuberant moments.

   5. At what price glory?

   While the willingness of the ancient Greeks to sacrifice their lives
   for glory brings tears to my eyes, I cannot ultimately condone the
   choice of Achilles. A short, glorious life in service of a greater good
   – say the life of the Spartans at Thermopylae, or the pilots in the
   Battle of Britain, of whom Winston Churchill said “Never have so many
   owed so much to so few,” – that is worth praising. But for glory alone?
   I think not.

   6. Greeks or Romans?

   Elizabeth Barrett Browning explained why you can’t make this choice:

   “What I do and what I dream include thee,
   As the wine must taste of its own grapes.”

   Both Greeks and Romans are part of my roots – part of all our roots. I
   can, however, admit to partiality to individual works: Homer over
   Virgil (and The Odyssey over The Iliad), but Horace over Theocritus,
   and much as I love classical Greek statuary, my deepest love is for
   Roman busts, those detailed portraits of real people, time travelers
   from an age so like our own.

       Agreed! Mixing Greek and Latin with sciences etc. gives balance and
       the ability to switch easily between coding software, practicing
       law, learning languages, analyzing business, considering politics,
       flying aerobatics or settling conflicts. Not that I always enjoyed
       the subjects in school but the rewards are obvious. All the rewards
       flow from the mindset Tim states in 1. above.

       Tim – Another reason why you seem to stand head and shoulders above
       those all too common technologists. A study of classics provides a
       perspective that is rarely afforded to those pursuing the latest
       meme or the results of the next quarter.
       I too have gained immeasurably from the classics you quote. Joseph
       Campbell has been another inspiration, drawing out the common
       themes of our humanity with this study of world mythologies. There
       is much in the non-secular literature that dwells on our humanness
       but perhaps out of favor in these times.
     * http://tim.oreilly.com/ Tim OʼReilly
       John,
       I thought about writing about both Epicureans and Stoics (who,
       contrary to popular opinion, are very close in their
       recommendations of how to live.)
       I do like Marcus Aurelius, and he does offer lessons for our time,
       the all powerful emperor who yet chose to live simply and dedicate
       his life to the hard work of building a better life for his people.
       The Meditations are one of the great works of classical literature
       that provide clarity and wisdom today.
       But I have to confess that despite the fact that their
       recommendations for living are remarkably similar, I find myself
       more drawn to Epicurus than to Zeno and his followers (including
       Marcus Aurelius).
       Zeno preached endurance. His was the philosophy of acceptance,
       perhaps the perfect philosophy for a tyrannical state, or for
       slaves who could not affect their own lot. I’ve always thought that
       Milton’s awesome lines from Paradise Lost
       The mind is its own place, and in itself.
       Can make a Heav’n of Hell, a Hell of Heav’n.
       sum up the underlying message of stoicism. And it’s a good message.
       Cognitive behavioral therapy, which tries to use “right reason” (to
       borrow Aristotle’s phrase) to correct the emotions, may be a modern
       descendant.
       Accordingly, Zeno preached moderation and acceptance of
       circumstances beyond our control.
       But how cool is it that someone who believes that pleasure is the
       ultimate end of life could come to the same conclusion?
       My favorite story about Epicurus concerns the afterlife. Should we
       be afraid of death? he was asked.
       No. Either there is no life after death, in which case, we won’t
       even know that life has ended. Or there is life after death, in
       which case we have something really interesting to look forward to.
       In either case, the rules for living are the same: happiness comes
       through moderation, through doing “right.”
       And of course that’s why I talked about Aristotle, because his idea
       of virtue is in fact a summation of the goals of all ancient
       philosophy: it was the quest to use reason to help us determine how
       best to live.
       Though they explored different dimensions, Aristotelians, Stoics,
       and Epicureans were all fellow travelers in this, and their guides
       to living well are all remarkably similar.
       (I know I’m glossing over a huge number of differences as well, but
       Powys’ injunction was that culture is what remains when the details
       of education have been forgotten. :-)
       BTW, for Aristotle, I highly recommend John Wild’s Introduction to
       Realistic Philosophy, which was my high school textbook.

       Hi Tim
       This is great to read, very interesting/revealing. If you want to
       get to know someone, look at their bookshelves, if any.
       I have similar guiding principle which falls under “the map is not
       the territory”. It’s a bit too involved to go into in any detail,
       but the gist is as follows.
       Much of how I think is influenced by evolutionary biology. The
       vaunted abilities of the human mind – reasoning, rationality,
       consciousness etc., – are very late inventions. As we endeavor to
       make sense of the world, we are all too eager to cede
       responsibility for real thought to the surface claims of the
       Johnny-come-lately rational mind, which assures us that it has
       everything figured out. Sometimes that’s right, but in many cases I
       think it’s far from the truth. Couple this with our tendencies to
       look for pat and reassuring explanations for things and the
       pressing need to communicate in short and simple terms, and you’ve
       got all the ingredients needed to spend your days not enquiring
       into the nature of things.
       That’s putting it very simplistically. Of course we must use our
       minds to reason, you can’t avoid that. To put it another way: the
       modern tools that evolution has given us are the map, not the
       territory. Society, our need to communicate, and our psychology all
       contribute to our tendency to take the map (what our high-level
       minds tell us) seriously, and to largely ignore the territory
       (millions of years of evolutionary history). This kind of (non-)
       thinking is almost ubiquitous. I am constantly amazed that more
       people do not look at things this way. Apart from being more work,
       I guess it’s still uncomfortable – just as it was to Wallace when,
       having co-articulated the process of evolution he could not stomach
       the idea that the principles might apply to humans. You say
       Socrates is your constant companion. Mine is Darwin. Not a day goes
       by that I don’t reflect on the fact that we’re all primates, and
       with some amazingly distorted map-driven beliefs and a huge blind
       spot for the territory.
       While you may not be able to discern the territory, being aware
       that the map on offer is both seductive and potentially distorting
       can guide you – in the sense of being a daimon.
       Being aware that the map is not the territory, is, I think, a very
       healthy stance – one which helps some people to think things
       through from first (or early) principles. Maybe that helps explain
       why you “get” what we’re trying to build at Fluidinfo. It’s hard to
       not think in terms of the prevailing paradigms, to not just go with
       the flow of “received knowledge”.
       It’s nice to read about your frame of reference for pulling this
       trick off. Now you have mine :-)

       up with something as fresh as fluidinfo!

       BTW, here’s another similar/related guiding principle, re. map
       (modern overconfidence) vs territory (what history tells us).
       Another useful prop when considering whether to think things
       through for yourself.

       First of all I must apologize because my english isn’t that good.
       I’ve been amazed by your interview because it’s something I’m
       debating with some of my students. I can now quote somebody who’s
       not exactly a traditionalist, a believer of that good-old-time
       faith. But my true problem is that I lightly disagree.
       I’ve got the feelings that, in our time of deep change, the
       classicals are a burden limiting our capacity to create something
       new. You can’t forgot that Socrates, Hadrian and the Stoics,
       Epicurus, Zeno and their mate were living in a slavery society,
       slightly misogynist and without our consideration regarding the
       living – remember what was happening to the children rejected by
       their father. This is not in their philosophy, i agree but this is
       their society. And you can see the worst of it in Plato’s Republic
       were wisdom and reason are birthing totalitarian power.
       In another part their ideas about human were standing on a quite
       erroneous knowledge. Thinking human being is something so special
       that you have to find the reasons of their bad or good behaviors in
       some strange place like soul or spirit when we know understand that
       this is just our primate’s side.
       Like you I can’t avoid thinking to the Fall of the Roman Empire
       when I read my newspaper on the morning. But the analogy is a lie.
       In the contrary you can search for a long time in the Greeks to
       find something like global warming threat or even something global…
       Their world was flat as our but a bit smaller.
       But the knowing of the past is a lesson for the understanding of
       the present, isn’t it. But a lot of people wealthy of classical
       culture were in all those totalitarian movement of the last
       century. By example our french excellent writer Robert Brasillach
       was a Nazi and the author of a really good Greek Poetry Anthology.
       I completely agree to your idea about culture and I think the more
       with know the more are our thinking are fair and human but it’s not
       enough and the youth needs a more living culture and some more
       efficient way to think. We must know of the classics but not with
       that excess of reverence.
     * http://friendfeed.com/hatchethead Jason Miller
       Thanks for this Q&A, @timoreilly. As a strong believer in the
       liberal arts, I’m often put in the position (by a student or
       parent) of having to explain its benefits. A liberal arts degree
       isn’t preparation for a career punctuated with you saying, “Do you
       want fries with that?” A liberal arts degree, whether it be focused
       on English or Classics or Mathematics or German, prepares you for
       all the decisions you will make in your life, and (hopefully)
       motivates you to keep learning so you can be a better citizen,
       better decision maker, better person.

       Hi Tim,
       You might also like Pierre Hadot’s book Philosophy as a Way of Life
       which is sort of a synthesis of the Stoics and Epicureans into
       “spiritual exercises.” That is, like you were saying, practical
       applications to our actual lives rather than classroom posturing.

       the shareholders”. I hope that you inspire a new generation of
       businessmen.

       The exact quote from Aristotle regarding virtue as found on many
       online sources is : âExcellence is an art won by training and
       habituation. We do not act rightly because we have virtue or
       excellence, but we rather have those because we have acted rightly.
       We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act but a
       habit.â

       Thank you, Tim.
       My whole family (Canada) and I were greatly stimulated by your
       post.
       Like true Greeks, we do not agree with everything in your text or
       the follow up comments but we did discuss everything at length.
       Thank you again because we all have benefited from this.
       With your permission, I’d like to attempt a translation to modern
       Greek for my family and friends in Greece.

       Hi Tim,
       I grew up in Germany where at 7th grade you decided whether to take
       Latin or do more Math and Physics. I am dyslexic, therefore always
       struggled with learning other languages and therefore chose the non
       Latin track.
       Looking back I still think that 4-5 years of 4-5 hours of Latin (in
       other schools even Greek on top) would have been better spend
       learning a living language: Italien, Arabic, Farsi, Chinese, … and
       using that knowledge to bring our living cultures closer together.
       There is an opportunity cost that people don’t take into account.
       You haven’t said anything about that, just wondering what your
       opinion is on that aspect of the classical education.
       Best, Mark.
     * http://tim.oreilly.com/ Tim OʼReilly
       Good question, Mark.
       In an odd way that I didn’t think to mention for the Forbes
       interview, the act of studying Latin and Greek in the original did
       play a great role in my success. Ultimately, parsing a dead
       language is very different than learning one that is still spoken.
       In doing so, I learned crucial “pattern recognition” skills.
       I thought often of this in my early years learning about computers.
       The obscure documentation I was working from in many cases was as
       difficult for me to parse as a Latin or Greek text, and many of the
       same skills were called for.
       I also find that knowledge of Latin and Greek provide a great boost
       for vocabulary. Knowing the origins of words helps you to see the
       layers of meaning. And in addition, I find I can often make out
       written inscriptions (say in museums) in any of the Romance
       languages.
       That being said, I would dearly have liked to have learned some
       modern languages as well, as my Latin and Greek are rusty from
       disuse, and I would love to be able to converse with my fellow
       Californians who speak Spanish, for example. I can get the gist of
       much written Spanish, but I’ve never taken the time to learn to
       speak or to hear it.
       One of the many projects that awaits!
       P.S. Remember the Perl slogan: “There’s more than one way to do
       it.”

       Tim, interesting commentary. I believe we all frame the world
       through the lens of out culture, experiences and education. As my
       education was in the sciences, I tend to see the world rather
       differently, but it interesting to see where the differences lie.
       For example, you have the story of Alexander and Diogenes as one
       foundation for your meme – create value and wealth for the
       ecosystem. I agree, but see it as an evolutionary more robust
       structure. We overlap in that we might both draw on historical
       parallels concerning the relationship between economic stability
       and wealth distribution.
       Another example is the parallel between the Roman Empire and modern
       America. I tend to see the framework as economic, as convincingly
       laid out by historian Paul Kennedy in “The Rise and fall of the
       Great Powers”. You may see it somewhat differently through examples
       that map well to our modern experience, such as the engagement in
       unnecessary wars, the self interest of the senate, etc.
       I’d be interested in a longer blog expounding in more detail how
       exactly your training led you to a particular insight, highlighting
       where the classics explicitly offered an approach or map and why
       other approaches, were not useful to you.

       Not sure your Syracuse/Iraq analogy is holding up. While there are
       certainly some parallels, we have not suffered the colossal defeat
       the Athenians suffered. Where the parallels do hold up, it is more
       along the lines of vicious backstabbing politics on the home front.

       I love this post because you show how the past can instruct our
       lives today. I appreciate the classics, but my true passion is
       learning about and teaching American history. The lessons from both
       the classical time period and the more recent past are more
       important than ever to study today due to the ever encompassing
       technology in our lives. With more information being available than
       ever before we need to teach kids not just how to sift through the
       good and bad info, but how to truly think. I’m not sure how to do
       that without having students have a foundation of historical
       understanding. Thanks for sharing these questions and your
       responses with us!
     * Sue Bianchi
       Encouraging to read your essay on a day when I am trying to
       reconstruct an undocumented spread sheet to assemble 18 months of
       health care utilization data. I studied Latin in high school for 4
       years (as well as 6 years of French). Our teacher also taught
       Spanish, so the parallels with Romance languages were often pointed
       out. We also wrote papers on topics of our choice, within a very
       broad definition of the classical mind. One of my papers was a
       study of birth of the hero stories in world cultures, including
       Christianity, classical Greek/Roman and orthodox psychoanalysis
       (e.g. Otto Rank. This was in the 11th grade, while translating
       Virgil. Not to blow my own horn, but I suspect few very average
       suburban high schools (like the one I attended) today offer this
       kind of foundation for critical thinking, pattern recognition and
       general systems thinking. Knowing Latin helped me learn German
       later as well as pick up enough modern Italian on my own to do
       preliminary translations of pharmaceutical clinical trial reports
       to determine if we needed to put them on the fast track to get a
       full translation. Knowing classical myths and terminology makes
       reading and explaining about new coccepts a much richer experience.
       I very much agree with your point about the value of having
       multiple ways to explain or promote an idea or process. I do also
       agree with the commenter who suggested we should keep in mind the
       flaws in classical society (slavery, devaluing women & children).
       But that doesn’t prevent us from effectively using these still
       revolutionary ideas to support the kinds of community values that
       we believe in.

       Sue Bianchi mentions her classical education in high school. I was
       very fortunate to have the same experience, attending a small
       pre-seminary high school. It was pretty language-intensive: four
       years of Latin, four years of German, two years of classical Greek.
       Indeed, the most challenging years in my educational career were
       the four years I spent in high school. Even more challenging than
       my doctoral studies.
       I don’t think I’ve seen any comments about this so far, but
       studying classical Greek was an invaluable experience. Learning to
       read a language in non-Roman characters at a tender young age seems
       to re-wire one’s brain a bit. At first I just transliterated, but
       later on I found myself reading the Greek without having to
       transliterate the Greek characters into their equivalent Roman
       characters. I think this helped to reinforce a natural tendency I
       had to see things differently, and to think differently. This has
       proven to be an invaluable tool throughout the course of my life.
     * Chuck Davis
       This is a quote I collected somewhere that was attributed to
       Russell Green – “The advantage of a classical education is that it
       enables you to despise the wealth that it prevents you from
       achieving.”
     * Bernie S
       Chuck Davis quotes Russell Green as saying: “The advantage of a
       classical education is that it enables you to despise the wealth
       that it prevents you from achieving.”
       While that’s humorous on a superficial level, I’m not sure it rings
       true, at least not for me. I don’t despise wealth…if someone made
       me a millionaire tomorrow, I wouldn’t complain. Rather, I think my
       classical education enabled me not to be envious of wealth, and
       helped me learn that it’s possible to lead a happy life without
       monetary wealth.
     * Mark
       Huh. So that explains why your books are so much more text-oriented
       than your competitors’, eschewing (for the most part) the confusion
       of type styles, boxes and marginalia that obfuscate the
       presentation of ideas. That’s good. As a software engineer via
       electrical engineering via Jesuit secondary school, I’m obsessed
       with grammar and style. Further, as A.E. Houseman put it:
       “It is easy say, and to fancy that you think, what you really do
       not think, and even what, if you seriously tried to think it, you
       would find to be unthinkable.”
       Which is a cleverer way than I can devise of pointing out that if
       you can’t state something clearly in words, you don’t really
       understand it. So I buy the books with lots of words…
     * John Slimick
       WRT to Mark’s comment: at the end of Wittgenstein’s
       Tractatus TheoPoliticus (well, you know what I mean)
       in German is the sentence usually translated into English as:
       “Of that of which we speak, we should speak
       clearly;
       if we cannot speak clearly, we should not speak
       at all.”
       This was part of the original ALGOL definition. I haven’t seen a
       similar quote on any definition since.

       Although I have been an O’Reilly reader since the time of “The
       Whole Internet” was unaware of Tim’s background. Encouraged by this
       would like to put forwards a few thoughts on ancient culture that
       reflect what I feel are current preoccupations.
       The ancient Greeks continued practices that controlled access to
       information, for example they also had “mysteries” with initiation.
       Eleusinian mysteries were a local variation of a cultural form
       widely practiced in civilazations before and some would say since.
       So in that respect ancient Greeks follow the line.
       What makes the difference imo is that they make innovations
       liberalizing access to information, media and knowledge management.
       Three contributions in particular:
       (1) Democracy can be seen as a knowldedge management tool if we see
       it as a way to challendge dominant culture and ideology. Of course
       this is easier said than done.
       Feedback systems are based on quality information being available.
       In a way we can see democracy as a large scale feedback system so
       access to information is crucial. Democracy alone may not be enough
       so additional tools are needed.
       (2) Theater: thousands of years ago someone noticed that people can
       be captivated when listening to a story. Perhaps it was a
       grandmother
       trying to calm her grandchildren. The next innovation came when
       someone turned story telling into a 3D performance. It was not long
       before people in power realized that narrative and performace was a
       good mechanism to teach ideas and spread ideology so they
       incorporated them into initiation. All this before the ancient
       Greeks.
       The ancient Greek contribution is that they took a closed cultural
       form and opened it up. Now it was possible for anyone to write a
       play and present his or her ideas that may not agree with the views
       of those above. So theater is a media liberalization move.
       (3) Proof: the problem with Pythagors was that he tried to control
       the idea of proof through his brotherhood. By the time we get to
       Euclid though we have moved to a vastly different attitude towards
       knowledge. While before people could talk about mystical
       dimensions, and divine geometry and architecture, now geometry
       became accessible
       by the community and proof could be verified by everybody. In that
       sense we can say Euclid was really an early free software activist.
       Access to the code falls right in with access to
       mathematical knowledge.
       Seeing the three ideas together they make sense as a substantial
       advance in knowledge management. Of course we can not live by
       theory alone. What the Romans brought into the picture is a superb
       ability to manage large systems, they simply understood the problem
       of scaling better that anyone before them and arguably many since
       then. So in answer to the question “Greeks or Romans”, I agree with
       Tim: both.
       What happens with the evolution of WWW, Web 2.0 etc take that
       ancient move to liberalize media and improve access to information,
       to a new level. Northern California seems an ancient Greek kind of
       place :)

       As but an up-and-coming youth of 25, I am glad someone as
       successful and seemingly well-balanced as yourself has put fitting
       words around the thoughts that run through my head on a daily
       basis.
       I don’t, unfortunately, have a classical education, but I do find
       myself reading books like Rubicon and spending hour upon hour
       researching the growth, majesty and eventual downfall of the Roman
       (and Byzantine) empires.
       Funny, I’ve been well aware of your existence for years — I have a
       lot to thank for my llama-adorned Perl book that first taught me to
       code at the ripe old age of 11 — but I had no idea you also wrote
       another language quite so well. I speak, of course, of English :)
       Cheers!

       Late to the party, but I thought I would come by and say thanks for
       this post Tim. I studied Latin in HS, Hindi in undergrad, and have
       loved philosophy since I was 16. I pursued a liberal arts degree in
       my undergrad, but have been an IT nerd since I was a kid now
       working in administration and support now. I mainly run into people
       that don’t care or respect the classics, but its nice to know
       others are out there. Everyone should read Herodotus, either
       abridged down like in the recent ‘snakes with wings and gold
       digging ants’ edition put out. I also have to agree with your
       answer about opera singing. I have never had such a spiritual and
       physical reaction to music until I met a girl who would practice
       her scales in the morning. I am lucky in some ways.
