World-Changing Ideas: A Q&A With Andrew Kassoy, Cofounder Of B Lab

As a founder of B Lab, a nonprofit that certifies sustainable businesses,
Andrew Kassoy knows all about the complexities of considering social good
while trying to grow a business. Join Co.Exist senior editor Ariel Schwartz
for a live chat with Kassoy on Tuesday, March 4 at noon (ET).

   [2cfc792f-0fb1-45bd-b52b-bcdabab9404b_300.jpg]

   As more states roll out benefit corporation legislation, allowing
   companies to pursue social good missions without getting sued by
   investors, the possibility of a public company becoming a benefit
   corporation increases (in fact, that was one of Co.Exist's
   predictions in our list of World-Changing Ideas for 2014).

   Andrew Kassoy, a former private equity investor who cofounded B Lab in
   2006, knows all about the complexities of considering social good while
   trying to grow a business. B Lab, a nonprofit that offers B Corporation
   certification to companies that meet certain corporate social
   responsibility standards (this is different from benefit corporation
   certification), has been working for years to familiarize the public
   with benefit corporations‹and to grow the ranks of B
   Corporation-certified companies.

   Join us as we talk to Andrew about B Corporations, benefit
   corporations, and the rising tide of companies that want to consider
   purpose alongside the bottom line.

     * Hi everyone. Thanks for joining us. We're going to get started in
       just a couple minutes. If you have any questions for Andrew, submit
       them with the "Make a comment" box above.
       by Ariel Schwartz 3/4/2014 4:57:08 PM
     * Hi Ariel,
       It's great to be here. I'm ready to go!
       by Andrew Kassoy 3/4/2014 5:00:38 PM
     * We're joined by Andrew Kassoy, a former private equity investor and
       the cofounder of B Lab—a nonprofit that certifies companies as B
       Corporations and campaigns for the growing benefit corporation
       movement (we'll define those terms in a minute). Today, over 20
       states legally recognize benefit corporation status, with many more
       states on the way. There are B Corporations in over 60 industries
       and 29 countries. Andrew will answer questions today about benefit
       corporations, B Corporations, and why we should pay attention to
       both of these things.
       by Ariel Schwartz 3/4/2014 5:01:11 PM
     * Again, if you have any questions, submit them via the "Make a
       comment" box above.
       by Ariel Schwartz 3/4/2014 5:01:33 PM
     * Let's start with a basic question. What's the difference between a
       B Corporation and a benefit corporation?
       by Ariel Schwartz 3/4/2014 5:03:05 PM
     * That's a good place to start. The two are often confused. They
       share much in common but have a couple of important differences.
       Certified B Corp is a certification conferred by the non-profit B
       Lab where I work - essentially it's a judgment by a private party -
       B Lab - that a company has achieved high levels of social and
       environmental performance, accountability, and transparency.
       Benefit corporation is a legal status - like a C Corp or S Corp or
       LLC or partnership - conferred by a state.
       by Andrew Kassoy 3/4/2014 5:06:06 PM
     * Here's a great link that explains some more detail on this.
       by Andrew Kassoy edited by Miles Kohrman 3/4/2014 5:06:45 PM
     * Is there a lot of overlap between B Corporations and benefit
       corporations?
       by Ariel Schwartz 3/4/2014 5:07:56 PM
     * While we wait for Andrew's response, some context: an article
       written by Ariel in 2011, detailing B Lab.
       by Miles Kohrman 3/4/2014 5:08:57 PM
     * There is some overlap. Since legislation started passing over the
       past few years, over 500 companies have chosen to change their
       legal status from C or S Corp to Benefit Corporation in the 20
       states that have passed the legislation. About 20% of those 500 are
       also Certified B Corps. And that number is rising as more Certified
       B Corps decide to ensure they can continue to pursue their mission
       even as they scale, go public, or sell.
       by Andrew Kassoy 3/4/2014 5:10:40 PM
     * Building on that, here's a question from the audience.
       by Ariel Schwartz 3/4/2014 5:11:47 PM
     * Is it true, though, that the approval of Benefit Corporations as a
       legal status in certain states
       has been catalyzed by the B Corps movement?
       by nina.farran@gmail.com 3/4/2014 5:11:49 PM
     * That's exactly right. Corporate law gets a bit confusing because
       it's different in every state. But the summary is that a lot of B
       Corps are incorporated as corporations in states like CA, DE, and
       CO where existing corporate law didn't allow them to expand their
       fiduciary duties to consider a broader set of interests than just
       maximizing shareholder value. So those companies starting talking
       to legislators about creating a new corporate form that was purpose
       build for companies with a purpose.

       gathering of the B Lab community.
       by Miles Kohrman 3/4/2014 5:14:39 PM
     * The benefit corp legislation, as it has marched through 20 states,
       culminating in Delaware, the home of corporate law in the U.S., is
       an incredible example of the power of the global B Corp movement.
       Collective action by a community of high impact businesses has
       changed corporate law in the U.S. and provided an opportunity for
       all of us to use business as a force for good.
       by Andrew Kassoy 3/4/2014 5:16:57 PM
     * Delaware recently started recognizing benefit corporation status.
       This is a big deal, because over half of all traded companies and
       almost two-thirds of venture-backed companies are incorporated in
       Delaware. Have you seen a lot of traction for benefit corporations
       in Delaware since this happened last year?
       by Ariel Schwartz 3/4/2014 5:17:33 PM
     * Here's a video that details the passage of legislation in DE:

       IFRAME:

       mode=opaque

       by Miles Kohrman via YouTube 3/4/2014 5:18:25 PM
     * Governor Markell signed DE's benefit corp bill in July, followed by
       a huge convening of investors, entrepreneurs, and other business
       leaders and policy makers at the World Economic Forum in NY. It was
       a seminal moment for corporate law, as you'll see in the video.
       Delaware is where venture and institutional investors look for
       companies to incorporate, so if we wanted to offer mainstream
       business the opportunity to change, Delaware was the place that
       matters most. On the first day, 17 companies, including Method and
       Plum Organics, incorporated as DE benefit corporations. In only six
       months since then, there are about 80 benefit corps in Delaware, so
       it is the state with the fastest growth in incorporation. Next
       stop: public companies!

     * To the point of the B Corp movement driving this change, on the day
       the legislation became effective, hundreds of B Corps signed an
       inspiring letter to business leaders on that day. Here's the link.

     * How long do you think it will take before a public company becomes
       a benefit corporation? And what are the hurdles to getting there?
       by Ariel Schwartz 3/4/2014 5:25:12 PM
     * [0362d399-4553-4664-a93a-4515f0c306b4_500.jpg]
       This map details the legislation that's been passed in the United
       States, and what's being worked on.
       by Miles Kohrman 3/4/2014 5:29:24 PM
     * Wild guess, but I'd bet less than 2 years. There are several large,
       venture-funded private companies that are considering it now that
       Delaware passed legislation. That said, there are hurdles, and our
       job is to help to educate and persuade to knock down those hurdles.
       Now that there is a legal corporate form, the biggest hurdle is
       culture: the operating assumption by lawyers, boards, and investors
       in the public markets is that short term shareholder value
       maximization is all that matters. We have to help them understand
       the opportunity to create better long term value, as well as more
       benefit for society (workers, community, environment), if they have
       a corporate charter that explicitly expands what they consider.
       Investors are conservative and skeptical, so this will take time.
       But there are phenomenal companies pursuing this, and they will be
       the ones to convince their investors.
       by Andrew Kassoy 3/4/2014 5:31:43 PM
     * Here's a related question from the audience.
       by Ariel Schwartz 3/4/2014 5:34:09 PM
     * I'm curious about whether B Lab has any suggestions for
       larger-scale corporations that are looking to embrace a more
       societal engagement-oriented business strategy. While some of the
       older, more traditional corporations believe there is an advantage
       to this practice, it comes with quite a bit of re-engineering, as
       well as a fear of push-back from shareholders. Any insights?
       by Erin P 3/4/2014 5:34:11 PM

       Here's a photo of Andrew answering your questions live!
       by Miles Kohrman 3/4/2014 5:36:48 PM
     * It starts with measuring what matters. For a lot of big, public
       companies, the ethos has been about corporate social responsibility
       - doing some good philanthropy or volunteering work. Those things
       are important, but they may have no effect on the real impact that
       the company has on society through its business practices or its
       products. To help companies measure what matter, we've opened up
       the same assessment tool that we use for certifying B Corps for ALL
       companies to use for free. It's called the B Impact Assessment. It
       allows any company to measure its impact on all of its
       stakeholders, and it provides benchmarking and improvement tools
       that allow a company to take action. Here's a link to the B Impact
       Assessment website:

     * @ArielSchwartz I am only seeing text here. Not hearing anything.
       But the photo suggests that Andrew is speaking. What am I missing,
       if anything at all?
       by Srinivasan Narayanan 3/4/2014 5:40:31 PM
     * Here's a way anyone can B the Change: Put your own company through
       that B Impact Assessment, or forward it on to friends at other
       companies. Or forward it to companies that you buy from or invest
       in, and ask them to go through it. It's free and confidential!

       by Miles Kohrman 3/4/2014 5:40:52 PM
     * An awesome example is B Corp Etsy. They went through the B Impact
       Assessment as an internal exercise. They just made the grade (80
       out of 200) for B Corp certification. But they weren't satisfied
       with their performance. They thought could create more value for
       their company, and all their stakeholders, if they looked carefully
       at how responsible and impactful a business they are. So they held
       a hackathon to gather ideas for how to improve. Since then, their B
       Score improved by about 25 points. There's a great story about it
       here:

       by Andrew Kassoy 3/4/2014 5:45:54 PM
     * How cool would it be if Apple and GE each went through the B Impact
       Assessment given their recent opposite responses to pressure to
       explicitly state they do not pursue anything other than shareholder
       value maximization? Given Apple's admirable response, maybe they
       should become a benefit corp too - make it clear by making it
       legal!
       by Andrew Kassoy 3/4/2014 5:49:22 PM
     * We've talked a bit about larger companies. But there can be a big
       financial burden on companies who want to become B Corps, because
       they have to meet certain strict social responsibility criteria. Is
       it a good idea for small companies/startups with limited resources
       to seek certification?
       by Ariel Schwartz 3/4/2014 5:50:23 PM
     * [99094193-1954-4a28-bb10-a6191b50bac0_500.jpg]
       While we wait for Andrew's response, here's a photo of the Etsy
       hackathon.
       by Miles Kohrman 3/4/2014 5:52:02 PM
     * It depends. There are lots of B Corps and other responsible
       businesses that would tell you that the work they've done to
       integrate mission into their business has saved or made them money
       - attract and retain talent, consumer loyalty, minimize risk, more
       efficient practices. There are some companies that make clear
       trade-offs, and the B Corp framework allows them to make that
       explicit and transparent so that they can attract the kind of
       talent, consumers, and investors who value that. There are 15,000
       companies using the B Impact Assessment, lots of them small
       start-ups. So I'd point them there to get started while they're
       small.
       by Andrew Kassoy 3/4/2014 5:54:54 PM
     * By the way, the B Impact Assessment is scaled based on the size of
       the company, so small start-ups don't have the same burdens as a
       big multi-national to qualify for certification.
       by Andrew Kassoy 3/4/2014 5:55:51 PM
     * One from the audience:
       by Ariel Schwartz 3/4/2014 5:58:30 PM
     * I am in Chicago and there are a number of thriving business
       incubators here - has B Lab partnered with any start up incubators
       to encourage certification and/or adoption of the benefit
       corporation business structure in the early stages so they can
       build the triple bottom line principals into their businesses from
       the start?
       by Christine edited by Ariel Schwartz 3/4/2014 5:58:32 PM
     * Yes! One of the best ways for us to have impact is to partner with
       great organizations that are building the next generation of great
       businesses. We've worked with a lot of incubators and accelerators,
       as well as a number of venture funds, investors, business school
       competitions, and government entities, to use the B Impact
       Assessment and B Corp certification as tools for these businesses.
       Here's a link to a list of those partners:

       by Andrew Kassoy 3/4/2014 6:01:35 PM
     * I'm interested to know what Mr. Kassoy says to skeptics? There are
       similar ideas floating around, perhaps most especially in marketing
       that also get push-back. I think his view on what to say to
       skepticism generally would be most interesting.

       by Miles Kohrman 3/4/2014 6:07:31 PM
     * Skeptics pat B Corps on the head and say this movement is cute but
       small. The evidence is quickly becoming to the contrary as B Corps
       and companies like them scale, disrupting and replacing traditional
       businesses.
       To borrow - or mangle - a great quote.... There are lots of
       skeptics. As the B Corp movement has gotten traction, skepticism
       from some with a strong interest in maintaining the status quo will
       transition to opposition. Eventually, it will just seem totally
       obvious that there is a better way to do business in which ALL
       companies compete not only to be best in the world, but best FOR
       the world. And when that happens, business as usual will be
       creating a shared and durable prosperity for all.
       by Andrew Kassoy edited by Miles Kohrman 3/4/2014 6:10:41 PM
     * Last question for you before we wrap up: where do you see the B
       Corp/benefit corporation movements five years from now? There has
       been so much traction just in the past few years that I imagine the
       landscape of participating companies could be pretty different.
       by Ariel Schwartz edited by Miles Kohrman 3/4/2014 6:11:35 PM
     * As the movement grows, there will be an increasing number of B
       Corps leading the way - 2,500-5,000. More important, we will move
       from 15,000 to 100,000 businesses using the B Impact Assessment to
       measure what matters. There will be thousands of companies using
       the benefit corp legal form, including many in the public markets.
       And millions of consumers will be making their purchasing
       decisions, and billions of dollars of investment capital will be
       flowing, based how much positive impact companies are creating for
       their society. And the movement will have grown exponentially
       globally. Today, there are B Corps in 32 countries - most recently
       Viet Nam and Lebanon - and 25% of the B Corp community is outside
       the U.S. In five years, well over 50% of the B Corp movement will
       be outside the U.S., bringing great companies to people who need
       them all over the world.
