What You'll Learn

   The depth and breadth of what's covered at Strata + Hadoop World
   requires 10 different tracks just to organize it all. You can follow
   one track from beginning to end, or pick the individual sessions that
   most interest you.
    1. Business & Industry Discover how organizations of all sizes use
       data to make better decisions.
    2. Connected World Chart your course in an always-connected, always-on
       world.
    3. Data Science Enhance your data science skill set—everything from
       the latest algorithms and advances in machine learning to the
       thorny issues of cultural change and team-building.
    4. Design & Interfaces Master user experience, design, new interfaces,
       and visualization.
    5. Law, Ethics & Open Data Explore issues on governance, ethics, and
       compliance in the era of open data.
    6. Machine Data Find out how to extract meaningful insights from data
       collected and generated by things—and overcome the obstacles of
       drinking from the Internet of Everything firehose, extracting
       context, and adapting faster.
    7. Security Use data to fight fraud, detect threats, and increase
       trust—and to secure data.
    8. Beyond Hadoop Learn about tools like Cassandra, Storm, Accumulo,
       Kafka and Spark—and how they fit in the data science toolkit.
    9. Hadoop in Action Delve into real-world case studies of the Hadoop
       ecosystem in action.
   10. The Hadoop Platform Dive deep into the dominant big data stack,
       with practical lessons and integration tricks.
