   With an amusingly retro cameo by Rob Reiner (Penny Marshall’s
   then-husband) as her boyfriend in the first episode, the series gets
   off to a funny if slightly insider-like slow start as Felix and Oscar
   take it upon themselves to remake the frumpy Myrna (Marshall) into
   marriage material but it grows stronger with the next four successive
   episodes.
