   Any recognition matters for a young company. But some recognition
   really matters.
   And a nod from Gartner, the world's most admired technology industry
   analyst, might matter most.
   In Anil Chawla's (pictured right) IBM days, recognition from Gartner
   was the ultimate validation for a product or tool. It meant the team
   was on the right track with a product, that it surely would serve
   clients well and make the company money.
   And so when Chawla received a call last month that ArchiveSocial's
   social media archiving tool had been selected as one of five Cool
   Vendors in Government, he couldn't help but feel that same affirmation.
   But this time, it carried with it excitement and
   anticipation—ArchiveSocial is his first startup and, along with a team
   that includes sales and business development director Adam Tury (left,
   on bull), he's working tirelessly to make it a success.
   "IBM is worried about what Gartner thinks. To have that same firm
   recognize a product we built from scratch as a startup is very
   meaningful," Chawla says.
   The call wasn't entirely random. A year ago, Chawla did something he
   calls "a shot in the dark activity" (Details of another of those,
   here). While studying his industry, he learned of Gartner analysts
   focused on information management and archiving for government. He
   emailed the group to introduce ArchiveSocial's social media archiving
   tool. It could help governments sort through and manage city and public
   officials' social media activity (to fulfill public records requests
   and legal requirements) and provide an open data portal for use by
   citizens.
   But there was no real outcome from his introductions until last month,
   when another analyst contacted Chawla after learning of ArchiveSocial
   from a colleague who received one of those early introductions.
   Says Chawla: "It's a good reminder to me that the few times I've taken
   a breath (from the day-to-day operations of a startup) and reached out,
   it's really paid off."
   So what makes a 'Cool Vendor?' Here's a video from Gartner describing
   it:

   In the case of government technologies, it's a cloud-based solution
   that improves management of social media communication, community
   development, citizen engagement, open data or performance management
   (understanding and defining success). The companies chosen as 'Cool
   Vendors" also have products that are easy to deploy quickly, cost
   effective and innovative, the report said.
   In a write up on ArchiveSocial, an analyst called it a best practice
   for government because ArchiveSocial makes it easier than previous
   methods to search and filter results spanning months and mimic the
   original records. It also allows for better government transparency—the
   tool is easy for citizens to use.
   The report did note some drawbacks to ArchiveSocial being a startup.
   It's competing in a crowded and competitive market where incumbent
   records management vendors may have a leg up in government procurement
   processes. As the first in the industry to offer its specific tool,
   ArchiveSocial will have to continuously add new services and management
   beyond Facebook, Twitter, LInkedIn and YouTube, the report also noted.
   But startup status hasn't deterred ArchiveSocial so far. In the five
   months since the team completed the Code for America accelerator in San
   Francisco, it has more than doubled the client base. New clients
   include the cities of San Francisco, Louisville and Charlotte, and
   soon, Durham City Schools. That's in addition to earlier clients like
   the city of Austin and the state of North Carolina. ArchiveSocial has
   powered the first open archive in the state since 2012.
   To manage the growth, Chawla is hiring at least two staff—a software
   engineer and marketer. And so far, he's done it all with less than
   $200,000 in funding.
   Chawla's story in many ways epitomizes the role of CEO at a startup.
   It's a person who can simultaneously do the mundane day-to-day work
   like updating a website, developing code, responding to emails and
   handling customer service issues, and also be aware enough of the
   broader landscape of an industry to make big picture bets even when
   they might seem like a long shot.
   Chawla reminds us, "You have to do (the "shot in the dark activities")
   enough where some small percentage of that is going to come back and
   pay dividends."
