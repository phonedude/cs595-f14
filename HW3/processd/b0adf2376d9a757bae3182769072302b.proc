   In the era of the Kindle, a book costs the same price as a sandwich.
   Dennis Johnson, an independent publisher, says that “Amazon has
   successfully fostered the idea that a book is a thing of minimal
   value—it’s a widget.” In the era of the Kindle, a book costs the same
   price as a sandwich. Dennis Johnson, an independent publisher, says
   that “Amazon has successfully fostered the idea that a book is a thing
   of minimal value—it’s a widget.” Credit Construction by Ian Wright.

   Amazon is a global superstore, like Walmart. It’s also a hardware
   manufacturer, like Apple, and a utility, like Con Edison, and a video
   distributor, like Netflix, and a book publisher, like Random House, and
   a production studio, like Paramount, and a literary magazine, like The
   Paris Review, and a grocery deliverer, like FreshDirect, and someday it
   might be a package service, like U.P.S. Its founder and chief
   executive, Jeff Bezos, also owns a major newspaper, the Washington
   Post. All these streams and tributaries make Amazon something radically
   new in the history of American business. Sam Walton wanted merely to be
   the world’s biggest retailer. After Apple launched the iPod, Steve Jobs
   didn’t sign up pop stars for recording contracts. A.T. & T. doesn’t
   build transmission towers and rent them to smaller phone companies, the
   way Amazon Web Services provides server infrastructure for startups
   (not to mention the C.I.A.). Amazon’s identity and goals are never
   clear and always fluid, which makes the company destabilizing and
   intimidating.

   Bezos originally thought of calling his company Relentless.com—that
   U.R.L. still takes you to Amazon’s site—before adopting the name of the
   world’s largest river by volume. (If Bezos were a reader of classic
   American fiction, he might have hit upon Octopus.com.) Amazon’s
   shape-shifting, engulfing quality, its tentacles extending in all
   directions, makes it unusual even in the tech industry, where rapid
   growth, not profitability, is the measure of success. Amazon is not
   just the “Everything Store,” to quote the title of Brad Stone’s rich
   chronicle of Bezos and his company; it’s more like the Everything. What
   remains constant is ambition, and the search for new things to be
   ambitious about.

   It seems preposterous now, but Amazon began as a bookstore. In 1994, at
   the age of thirty, Bezos, a Princeton graduate, quit his job at a
   Manhattan hedge fund and moved to Seattle to found a company that could
   ride the exponential growth of the early commercial Internet. (Bezos
   calculated that, in 1993, usage climbed by two hundred and thirty
   thousand per cent.) His wife, MacKenzie, is a novelist who studied
   under Toni Morrison at Princeton; according to Stone, Bezos’s favorite
   novel is Kazuo Ishiguro’s “The Remains of the Day,” which is on the
   suggested reading list for Amazon executives. All the other titles,
   including “Sam Walton, Made in America: My Story,” are business books,
   and even Ishiguro’s novel—about a self-erasing English butler who
   realizes that he has missed his chance at happiness in love—offers what
   Bezos calls a “regret-minimization framework”: how not to end up like
   the butler. Bezos is, above all things, pragmatic. (He declined to be
   interviewed for this article.)

   It wasn’t a love of books that led him to start an online bookstore.
   “It was totally based on the property of books as a product,” Shel
   Kaphan, Bezos’s former deputy, says. Books are easy to ship and hard to
   break, and there was a major distribution warehouse in Oregon.
   Crucially, there are far too many books, in and out of print, to sell
   even a fraction of them at a physical store. The vast selection made
   possible by the Internet gave Amazon its initial advantage, and a wedge
   into selling everything else. For Bezos to have seen a bookstore as a
   means to world domination at the beginning of the Internet age, when
   there was already a crisis of confidence in the publishing world, in a
   country not known for its book-crazy public, was a stroke of business
   genius.

   In 1995, in Chicago, Bezos manned an Amazon booth at the annual
   conclave of the publishing industry, which is now called BookExpo
   America. Roger Doeren, from a Kansas City store called Rainy Day Books,
   was stopped short by Amazon’s sign: “Earth’s Biggest Bookstore.”
   Approaching Bezos, he asked, “Where is Earth’s biggest bookstore?”

   “Cyberspace,” Bezos replied.

   “We started a Web site last year. Who are your suppliers?”

   “Ingram, and Baker & Taylor.”

   “Ours, too. What’s your database?”

   “ ‘Books in Print.’ ”

   “Ours, too. So what makes you Earth’s biggest?”

   “We have the most affiliate links”—a form of online advertising.

   Doeren considered this, then asked, “What’s your business model?”

   Bezos said that Amazon intended to sell books as a way of gathering
   data on affluent, educated shoppers. The books would be priced close to
   cost, in order to increase sales volume. After collecting data on
   millions of customers, Amazon could figure out how to sell everything
   else dirt cheap on the Internet. (Amazon says that its original
   business plan “contemplated only books.”)

   Afterward, Doeren told his partner at Rainy Day Books, Vivien Jennings,
   “I just met the world’s biggest snake-oil salesman. It’s going to be
   really bad for books.”

   Before Google, and long before Facebook, Bezos had realized that the
   greatest value of an online company lay in the consumer data it
   collected. Two decades later, Amazon sells a bewildering array of
   products: lawnmowers, iPods, art work, toys, diapers, dildos, shoes,
   bike racks, gun safes, 3-D printers. Amazon’s code of corporate secrecy
   is extreme—it won’t confirm how many Seattle employees it has, or how
   many Kindle e-readers have been sold—so it’s impossible to know for
   sure, but, according to one publisher’s estimate, book sales in the
   U.S. now make up no more than seven per cent of the company’s roughly
   seventy-five billion dollars in annual revenue.

   Origins, though, leave lasting marks, and Amazon remains intimately
   tangled up in books. Few notice if Amazon prices an electronics store
   out of business (except its staff); but, in the influential,
   self-conscious world of people who care about reading, Amazon’s
   unparalleled power generates endless discussion, along with paranoia,
   resentment, confusion, and yearning. For its part, Amazon continues to
   expend considerable effort both to dominate this small, fragile market
   and to win the hearts and minds of readers. To many book professionals,
   Amazon is a ruthless predator. The company claims to want a more
   literate world—and it came along when the book world was in distress,
   offering a vital new source of sales. But then it started asking a lot
   of personal questions, and it created dependency and harshly exploited
   its leverage; eventually, the book world realized that Amazon had its
   house keys and its bank-account number, and wondered if that had been
   the intention all along.

   Recently, Amazon even started creating its own “content”—publishing
   books. The results have been decidedly mixed. A monopoly is dangerous
   because it concentrates so much economic power, but in the book
   business the prospect of a single owner of both the means of production
   and the modes of distribution is especially worrisome: it would give
   Amazon more control over the exchange of ideas than any company in U.S.
   history. Even in the iPhone age, books remain central to American
   intellectual life, and perhaps to democracy. And so the big question is
   not just whether Amazon is bad for the book industry; it’s whether
   Amazon is bad for books.

   In the nineteen-nineties, a different leviathan held publishers and
   independent bookstores in its grasp: chain stores, led by Barnes &
   Noble. When Amazon emerged, publishers in New York suddenly had a new
   buyer that paid quickly, sold their backlist as well as new titles,
   and, unlike traditional bookstores, made very few returns. Publishers
   must buy back unsold inventory from retailers, an archaic and costly
   practice that one ex-Amazon employee called “an absurdly inefficient
   model, worse than my uncle sending his laundry home from college.”

   John Sargent, who is the chief executive of Macmillan, first met Bezos
   in the mid-nineties, at a hotel in Washington, D.C. “He was this
   incredibly energetic guy,” Sargent said. “I thought it was a really
   good idea.” Jane Friedman, who was then an associate publisher at
   Knopf, and subsequently ran HarperCollins, said of Bezos, “I was
   completely taken with him. He was a skinny kid, he was young, he was
   excitable, and he was completely serious about what he was doing. I
   drank the Kool-Aid.”

   Amazon’s revenue multiplied every year. In the late nineties, an Amazon
   vice-president named Mary Morouse e-mailed her colleagues after a trip
   to visit publishers in New York. “We are certainly popular with them,”
   she wrote. “They rave about Amazon.com—both as a store/service and a
   great way to market books. There were several examples cited where
   Amazon.com ‘made’ titles. And they love our sales numbers.”

   good recipe for puff pastry?”Buy or license »

   Publishers weren’t troubled that Amazon sold their books at dramatic
   discounts. They all wanted to collaborate with the Seattle upstart, and
   they used Amazon as an information resource; it was a vast improvement
   over the old green-bound copies of “Books in Print.” A New York
   marketing executive told me, “When Amazon came into the picture,
   metadata”—code numbers, Library of Congress categories, search
   keywords—“became an integral part of books.” A few farsighted
   publishers wondered if Amazon would eventually control so much of the
   market that it would stop selling books at cost and raise prices to
   become more profitable.

   By 1997, when the company went public, Amazon’s book inventory could
   have filled six football fields. But someone who read Bezos’s year-end
   letter to shareholders might well have thought that Amazon’s
   eight-hundred-and-thirty-eight-per-cent sales growth had been in shoes,
   since he barely mentioned books. In the letter, Bezos noted tersely,
   “We are planning to add music to our product offering.” (Unlike Jobs,
   Bezos wasn’t a passionate listener: he once agreed to be interviewed
   for a program about the Beatles, and when employees, prepping the boss,
   asked him to name a favorite Beatles tune, Bezos chose “America,” by
   Simon & Garfunkel.) Soon after music came DVDs and consumer
   electronics. A New York literary agent told me that books were Amazon’s
   version of “a gateway drug.”

   Sargent said that Bezos’s ambition was apparent to him from the
   beginning—“My God, he drives hard.” But he couldn’t see Bezos’s master
   plan “for shit.” “He was already going to be the Everything Store,”
   Sargent said when we met in his trapezoidal office, in the narrow wedge
   of the Flatiron Building. “I thought he was just a bookstore, stupid
   me. Books were going to be the way to get the names and the data. Books
   were his customer-acquisition strategy.” As long as Amazon kept growing
   like mad, investors would pour in money and Wall Street wouldn’t pay
   much attention to profits. (The company didn’t have a profitable
   quarter until 2001, and still struggles to stay in the black.)

   In the mid- to late nineties, Bezos hired two dozen writers and editors
   to produce copy for the Web site. One of them—Amazon employee No.
   55—was a cultural critic from New York named James Marcus, who, in
   turn, brought in his friend Kerry Fried, who edited his pieces at the
   Village Voice. (She had also worked at several New York publishers and
   at The New York Review of Books.) For these refugees from New York,
   where jobs in publishing and journalism were already beginning to thin
   out, Amazon offered the thrill of working at a rising power, with stock
   options and an enormous audience.

   Marcus edited the home page, which was visited by at least thirty
   million people a day. Under the rubric “Books Favorites,” he and his
   staff often promoted novels that needed a push to claim an audience,
   such as Myla Goldberg’s “Bee Season.” Marcus wrote hundreds of short
   book reviews and thousands of descriptive blurbs; Fried, who edited the
   Literature and Fiction section with Marcus, posted interviews with
   authors, including Penelope Fitzgerald and Stanley Kunitz. In 2004,
   Marcus, now the executive editor of Harper’s, published a wry,
   bittersweet memoir of his experience, “Amazonia.” He told me, “It was
   useful to Amazon, as a business strategy, to convey the feeling of your
   beloved indie bookstore, full of hip, book-loving people.”

   Readers, especially isolated ones, adored Amazon. “We heard from people
   all the time,” Marcus said. “ ‘I live in some Podunk town, the nearest
   bookstore is a hundred miles from my house, and now I can get the most
   obscure book.’ ” Marcus asked Toni Morrison to do an interview. “I’m
   happy to talk,” she told him. “I hear you’re selling more books than
   anyone in the history of the world.”

   In “Amazonia,” Marcus describes Bezos’s “anticharismatic charisma,
   which would have mortified a Great Man of a century ago but seemed just
   right for our nerd-driven meritocracy.” In those years, Bezos joined
   his staff for the round-the-clock work of “picking” and shipping books
   at warehouses during the holiday season. One day in 1997, Fried went
   into the company kitchen and found him absorbed in assembling an ant
   farm. “He had a lot of curiosity,” she said. “I keep hearing about
   Jeff’s temper, but I have to say I never witnessed it. He was really
   pleasant and fun.” His ambition sometimes had an idealistic cast: he
   wanted Amazon to warehouse two copies of every book ever printed, an
   unrealized dream grandly called the Alexandria Project.

   At Amazon, original writing wasn’t even called “content.” It was known
   as “verbiage,” simplified to “verbage.” Amazon’s writers and editors
   formed a counterculture that never fit easily in a company ruled by
   computer engineers and M.B.A.s, who valued data most and believed only
   in measurable truths. “The key to understanding Amazon is the hiring
   process,” one former employee said. “You’re not hired to do a
   particular job—you’re hired to be an Amazonian. Lots of managers had to
   take the Myers-Briggs personality tests. Eighty per cent of them came
   in two or three similar categories, and Bezos is the same: introverted,
   detail-oriented, engineer-type personality. Not musicians, designers,
   salesmen. The vast majority fall within the same personality
   type—people who graduate at the top of their class at M.I.T. and have
   no idea what to say to a woman in a bar.”

   The humanists at Amazon brought a strain of intellectual irony that set
   them apart from the company’s cult of relentlessness. Bezos closed
   annual reports to shareholders with an exhortation to experiment and to
   fight complacency: “This is still Day 1.” Marcus and Fried joked about
   writing a novel that would begin, “It was Day 1. Again.” (Amazon
   recently began publishing a literary magazine for its Kindle device:
   Day One.)

   One important way that Bezos’s writers and editors differed from the
   tech and business people was in their gentler attitude toward book
   publishers. Even when Amazon’s entire business was in books, and its
   relations with publishers were fairly good, it nurtured a certain
   impatience with New York houses that supplied the products it sold.
   Mary Morouse’s account of her trip east in 1999 reported, “I had one
   S.V.P. of sales tell me, ‘We like any account who is growing faster
   than we are, but we don’t really forecast that way.’ When I asked him
   how much they are growing, he said ‘I don’t know. I think we were flat
   last year.’ That gives you some idea of the level of business focus.”
   According to Marcus, Amazon executives considered publishing people
   “antediluvian losers with rotary phones and inventory systems designed
   in 1968 and warehouses full of crap.” Publishers kept no data on
   customers, making their bets on books a matter of instinct rather than
   metrics. They were full of inefficiences, starting with overpriced
   Manhattan offices. There was “a general feeling that the New York
   publishing business was just this cloistered, Gilded Age antique just
   barely getting by in a sort of Colonial Williamsburg of commerce, but
   when Amazon waded into this they would show publishing how it was
   done.”

   During the 1999 holiday season, Amazon tried publishing books, leasing
   the rights to a defunct imprint called Weathervane and putting out a
   few titles. “These were not incipient best-sellers,” Marcus writes.
   “They were creatures from the black lagoon of the remainder
   table”—Christmas recipes and the like, selected with no apparent
   thought. Employees with publishing experience, like Fried, were not
   consulted. Weathervane fell into an oblivion so complete that there’s
   no trace of it on the Internet. (Representatives at the company today
   claim never to have heard of it.) Nobody at Amazon seemed to absorb any
   lessons from the failure. A decade later, the company would try again.

   Amazon was a megastore, not an indie bookshop, let alone a literary
   review, and its writers were under pressure to prove that their work
   produced sales. If a customer clicked on a review or an interview, then
   left the page without making a purchase, it was logged as a Repel.
   Marcus was informed that his repulsion rate was too high. “Nobody ever
   felt safe,” Fried said of her editorial colleagues. “I took home my
   Rolodex every day.”

   Book retailers, such as Barnes & Noble, negotiate “co-op,” or
   coöperative promotional fees, from publishers in exchange for prominent
   product placement. It’s a way for a retailer to get a larger discount
   without violating the 1936 Robinson-Patman Act, which prohibits
   producers from offering price advantages to favored retailers. Although
   co-op fees weren’t “dreamed up by Amazon,” Marcus told me, “Amazon
   proved to be particularly good at squeezing this money out of
   publishers.” Publishers paid ten thousand dollars for a book to be
   prominently featured on the home page. They never knew exactly how much
   these payments helped sales, and negotiations over them became tense.
   (In a statement, Amazon said, “As a general practice, we don’t discuss
   our business negotiations with publishers.”)
   [140217_a18045-600.jpg] Buy or license »

   Each category within Amazon’s Books division had to collect co-op fees,
   and revenue targets rose steeply. In 1999, the company received
   $3,621,250 in co-op fees; the goal for 2000 was set at $9.25 million.
   When Marcus asked if publishers should be given sales targets in
   exchange for their payments, Lyn Blake, the executive who had created
   the co-op program, said no, adding, “Look, it’s the cost of doing
   business.” The editorial staff was reminded that the money, unlike the
   receipts on sold books, went straight to Amazon’s bottom line.
   Judgments about which books should be featured on the site were
   increasingly driven by promotional fees.

   Around this time, a group called the “personalization team,” or P13N,
   started to replace editorial suggestions for readers with algorithms
   that used customers’ history to make recommendations for future
   purchases. At Amazon, “personalization” meant data analytics and
   statistical probability. Author interviews became less frequent, and
   in-house essays were subsumed by customer reviews, which cost the
   company nothing. Tim Appelo, the entertainment editor at the time,
   said, “You could be the Platonic ideal of the reviewer, and you would
   not beat even those rather crude early algorithms.” Amazon’s
   departments competed with one another almost as fiercely as they did
   with other companies. According to Brad Stone, a trash-talking sign was
   hung on a wall in the P13N office: “PEOPLE FORGET THAT JOHN HENRY DIED
   IN THE END.” Machines defeated human beings.

   In December, 1999, at the height of the dot-com mania, Time named Bezos
   its Person of the Year. “Amazon isn’t about technology or even
   commerce,” the breathless cover article announced. “Amazon is, like
   every other site on the Web, a content play.” Yet this was the moment,
   Marcus said, when “content” people were “on the way out.” Although the
   writers and the editors made the site more interesting, and easier to
   navigate, they didn’t bring more customers. One day, Fried discovered a
   memo, written by a programmer and accidentally left on a printer, which
   suggested eliminating the editorial department. Anne Hurley, the
   editor-in-chief of the DVD and Video section, was viewed dismissively
   by her boss, Jason Kilar, who went on to run the video-streaming
   company Hulu. He told her, “I’m sorry, Anne, I just don’t see what
   value you add.” (Kilar denies saying this.)

   In July, 2000, Bezos sent out a company-wide e-mail with the subject
   line “Smile, remember it’s Day 1, and let’s kick some butt.” Several
   months earlier, the bubble had burst, and Amazon’s overcapitalized
   share price was plunging. For the first time, Wall Street lost faith in
   the company, and Bezos announced that the next eighteen months would be
   devoted to making “serious profits.” Marcus and Fried quit before they
   could be laid off. Tim Appelo took Marcus’s place. “I was the last
   human editor of the home page,” he told me. “By the time I got there,
   it was only partly human.” By 2002, the home page was fully automated.
   (Today, eight editors select titles to be featured on the Books page,
   and if you scour the site you can find a books blog, Omnivoracious, but
   its offerings seem marginal to the retail enterprise.) Editorial
   content had served its purpose, just as selling books had served its
   purpose, and Amazon’s conquistadores galloped onward.

   The fact that Amazon once devoted significant space on its site to
   editorial judgments—to thinking and writing—would be an obscure
   footnote if not for certain turns in the company’s more recent history.
   According to one insider, around 2008—when the company was selling far
   more than books, and was making twenty billion dollars a year in
   revenue, more than the combined sales of all other American
   bookstores—Amazon began thinking of content as central to its business.
   Authors started to be considered among the company’s most important
   customers. By then, Amazon had lost much of the market in selling music
   and videos to Apple and Netflix, and its relations with publishers were
   deteriorating. These difficulties offended Bezos’s ideal of “seamless”
   commerce. “The company despises friction in the marketplace,” the
   Amazon insider said. “It’s easier for us to sell books and make books
   happen if we do it our way and not deal with others. It’s a
   tech-industry thing: ‘We think we can do it better.’ ” If you could
   control the content, you controlled everything.

   Many publishers had come to regard Amazon as a heavy in khakis and
   oxford shirts. In its drive for profitability, Amazon did not raise
   retail prices; it simply squeezed its suppliers harder, much as Walmart
   had done with manufacturers. Amazon demanded ever-larger co-op fees and
   better shipping terms; publishers knew that they would stop being
   favored by the site’s recommendation algorithms if they didn’t comply.
   Eventually, they all did. (Few customers realize that the results
   generated by Amazon’s search engine are partly determined by
   promotional fees.) Sales meetings in Seattle were now all about
   payments, not new books, and the size of orders was predicated on
   algorithms, rather than on the enthusiasm of the publishers’ sales
   staff and Amazon’s own buyers, who were rebranded as “inventory
   managers.” Brad Stone describes one campaign to pressure the most
   vulnerable publishers for better terms: internally, it was known as the
   Gazelle Project, after Bezos suggested “that Amazon should approach
   these small publishers the way a cheetah would pursue a sickly
   gazelle.” (Company lawyers later changed the name to the Small
   Publisher Negotiation Program.)

   “The Gazelle Project—that was me,” Dennis Johnson, a co-owner of
   Melville House, a small publisher with offices on the Brooklyn
   waterfront, said. Melville House puts out quality fiction and
   nonfiction, including “Debt: The First 5,000 Years,” by the anarchist
   anthropologist David Graeber; “The Flight of the Intellectuals,” by
   Paul Berman; and translations of the German novelist Hans Fallada. In
   2004, when Melville House was just getting started, Johnson’s
   distributor called him and described his negotiations with Amazon as
   being “like dinner with the Godfather.” Amazon wanted a payment without
   having to reveal how many Melville House books were sold on the site.
   (Amazon rarely makes its sales figures public, using bar graphs without
   numbers in presentations.) “ ‘Fuck you’ was my attitude,” Johnson said.
   “ ‘They’re bluffing—I’m going to call their bluff.’ I’m a working-class
   kid. I come at this from ‘This is my company, you don’t come in here.’
   ” Johnson, who remains one of the few people in publishing willing to
   criticize Amazon on the record, contacted reporters, and Publishers
   Weekly ran a story. By the next day, the BUY buttons had disappeared
   from Melville House’s titles on Amazon.com. Not long afterward, the
   Book Expo was held at the Javits Center, in Manhattan. Two young men in
   suits approached Melville House’s booth and pointed fingers at Johnson.
   “When are you going to get with the program?” they asked. The men were
   wearing Amazon nametags.

   Before the impasse, Amazon had represented eight per cent of Melville
   House’s sales, more than Johnson could afford to lose. So he
   capitulated. “I paid that bribe”—he wouldn’t disclose the amount—“and
   the books reappeared.”

   The process of paying co-op fees to promote individual titles grew
   increasingly complex, especially after Amazon began selling different
   levels of promotion. Without dropping co-op fees entirely, Amazon
   simplified its system: publishers were asked to hand over a percentage
   of their previous year’s sales on the site, as “marketing development
   funds.” Publishers dread the annual negotiation of this payoff; one of
   them described it as “squeezing our nuts.” The figure keeps rising,
   though less for the giant pachyderms than for the sickly gazelles.
   According to the marketing executive, the larger houses, which used to
   pay two or three per cent of their net sales through Amazon, now
   relinquish five to seven per cent of gross sales, pushing Amazon’s
   percentage discount on books into the mid-fifties. Random House
   currently gives Amazon an effective discount of around fifty-three per
   cent.

   For a smaller house, Amazon’s total discount can go as high as sixty
   per cent, which cuts deeply into already slim profit margins. Because
   Amazon manages its inventory so well, it often buys books from small
   publishers with the understanding that it can’t return them, for an
   even deeper discount. Publishers sometimes pass on this cost to
   authors, by redefining royalties as a percentage of the publisher’s
   receipts, not of the book’s list price. Recently, publishers say,
   Amazon began demanding an additional payment, amounting to
   approximately one per cent of net sales. Once the fee was paid,
   publishing executives could discuss marketing strategies with Amazon
   staff; otherwise, they’d have to rely on the company’s algorithms.
   “There really are rules in play,” a former Amazon executive says. If a
   publisher resists when Amazon asks for a “bump” in payments, its books
   “can’t be promoted.”

   In 2003, Amazon introduced Search Inside the Book, which allowed
   customers to hunt for a phrase in a book without having to buy it.
   Publishers warily allowed Amazon to scan some of their titles and
   convert the images into searchable text. They didn’t realize that they
   were giving Amazon a huge head start over potential competitors when it
   decided to go into the digital-books business.

   In the mid-aughts, Bezos, having watched Apple take over the
   music-selling business with iTunes and the iPod, became determined not
   to let the same thing happen with books. In 2004, he set up a lab in
   Silicon Valley that would build Amazon’s first piece of consumer
   hardware: a device for reading digital books. According to Stone’s
   book, Bezos told the executive running the project, “Proceed as if your
   goal is to put everyone selling physical books out of a job.”
   Meanwhile, Amazon began pushing publishers to digitize and sign retail
   agreements on as many titles as possible. “Our charter was to launch
   with a hundred thousand books and ninety per cent of the best-seller
   list,” Jeff Steele, who worked on the project, said. (Steele left the
   company because he objected to Amazon’s heavy-handed tactics with
   publishers.) In late 2007, at a press conference in New York, Bezos
   unveiled the Kindle, a simple, lightweight device that—in a crucial
   improvement over previous e-readers—could store as many as two hundred
   books, downloaded from Amazon’s 3G network. Bezos announced that the
   price of best-sellers and new titles would be nine-ninety-nine,
   regardless of length or quality—a figure that Bezos, inspired by
   Apple’s sale of songs on iTunes for ninety-nine cents, basically pulled
   out of thin air. Amazon had carefully concealed the number from
   publishers. “We didn’t want to let that cat out of the bag,” Steele
   said.

   The price was below wholesale in some cases, and so low that it
   represented a serious threat to the market in twenty-six-dollar
   hardcovers. Bookstores that depended on hardcover sales—from Barnes &
   Noble and Borders (which liquidated its business in 2011) to Rainy Day
   Books in Kansas City—glimpsed their possible doom. If reading went
   entirely digital, what purpose would they serve? The next year, 2008,
   which brought the financial crisis, was disastrous for bookstores and
   publishers alike, with widespread layoffs.

   By 2010, Amazon controlled ninety per cent of the market in digital
   books—a dominance that almost no company, in any industry, could claim.
   Its prohibitively low prices warded off competition. The literary agent
   Andrew Wylie (whose firm represents me) says, “What Bezos wants is to
   drag the retail price down as low as he can get it—a
   dollar-ninety-nine, even ninety-nine cents. That’s the Apple play—‘What
   we want is traffic through our device, and we’ll do anything to get
   there.’ ” If customers grew used to paying just a few dollars for an
   e-book, how long before publishers would have to slash the cover price
   of all their titles?

   Publishers looked around for a competitor to Amazon, and they found one
   in Apple, which was getting ready to introduce the iPad, and the iBooks
   Store. Apple wanted a deal with each of the Big Six houses (Hachette,
   HarperCollins, Macmillan, Penguin, Random House, and Simon & Schuster)
   that would allow the publishers to set the retail price of titles on
   iBooks, with Apple taking a thirty-per-cent commission on each sale.
   This was known as the “agency model,” and, in some ways, it offered the
   publishers a worse deal than selling wholesale to Amazon. But it gave
   publishers control over pricing and a way to challenge Amazon’s grip on
   the market. Apple’s terms included the provision that it could match
   the price of any rival, which induced the publishers to impose the
   agency model on all digital retailers, including Amazon.

   Five of the Big Six went along with Apple. (Random House was the
   holdout.) Most of the executives let Amazon know of the change by phone
   or e-mail, but John Sargent flew out to Seattle to meet with four
   Amazon executives, including Russ Grandinetti, the vice-president of
   Kindle content. In an e-mail to a friend, Sargent wrote, “Am on my way
   out to Seattle to get my ass kicked by Amazon.”

   Sargent’s gesture didn’t seem to matter much to the Amazon executives,
   who were used to imposing their own terms. Seated at a table in a small
   conference room, Sargent said that Macmillan wanted to switch to the
   agency model for e-books, and that if Amazon refused Macmillan would
   withhold digital editions until seven months after print publication.
   The discussion was angry and brief. After twenty minutes, Grandinetti
   escorted Sargent out of the building. The next day, Amazon removed the
   BUY buttons from Macmillan’s print and digital titles on its site, only
   to restore them a week later, under heavy criticism. Amazon unwillingly
   accepted the agency model, and within a couple of months e-books were
   selling for as much as fourteen dollars and ninety-nine cents.

   Amazon filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission. In April,
   2012, the Justice Department sued Apple and the five publishers for
   conspiring to raise prices and restrain competition. Eventually, all
   the publishers settled with the government. (Macmillan was the last,
   after Sargent learned that potential damages could far exceed the
   equity value of the company.) Macmillan was obliged to pay twenty
   million dollars, and Penguin seventy-five million—enormous sums in a
   business that has always struggled to maintain respectable profit
   margins.

   Apple fought the charges, and the case went to trial last June.
   Grandinetti, Sargent, and others testified in the federal courthouse in
   lower Manhattan. As proof of collusion, the government presented
   evidence of e-mails, phone calls, and dinners among the Big Six
   publishers during their negotiations with Apple. Sargent and other
   executives acknowledged that they wanted higher prices for e-books, but
   they argued that the evidence showed them only to be competitors in an
   incestuous business, not conspirators. On July 10th, Judge Denise Cote
   ruled in the government’s favor.

   Apple, facing up to eight hundred and forty million dollars in damages,
   has appealed. As Apple and the publishers see it, the ruling ignored
   the context of the case: when the key events occurred, Amazon
   effectively had a monopoly in digital books and was selling them so
   cheaply that it resembled predatory pricing—a barrier to entry for
   potential competitors. Since then, Amazon’s share of the e-book market
   has dropped, levelling off at about sixty-five per cent, with the rest
   going largely to Apple and to Barnes & Noble, which sells the Nook
   e-reader. In other words, before the feds stepped in, the agency model
   introduced competition to the market. But the court’s decision
   reflected a trend in legal thinking among liberals and conservatives
   alike, going back to the seventies, that looks at antitrust cases from
   the perspective of consumers, not producers: what matters is lowering
   prices, even if that goal comes at the expense of competition. Barry
   Lynn, a market-policy expert at the New America Foundation, said, “It’s
   one of the main factors that’s led to massive consolidation.” Judge
   Cote’s opinion described Amazon’s business practices in glowing terms,
   and she argued, “If Apple is suggesting that Amazon was engaging in
   illegal, monopolistic practices, and that Apple’s combination with the
   Publisher Defendants to deprive a monopolist of some of its market
   power is pro-competitive and healthy for our economy, it is wrong.”

   Those were sweet words for a company that declares itself to be
   “Earth’s most customer-centric company.” Even its bitterest critics
   reluctantly admit to using Amazon, unable to resist its unparalleled
   selection, price, and convenience. When Bezos talks about serving the
   customer, it’s as if he were articulating his purpose in life. “The
   customer is almost theological,” James Marcus said. “Any sacrifice is
   suitable for the customer.”

   “Jeff is trying to create a machine that assumes the shape of public
   demand,” Tim Appelo, the former entertainment editor, said. “He
   resembles a very, very smart shmoo—he only wants to serve, to make you
   happy.” Appelo was referring to Al Capp’s smiling blob of a cartoon
   character, which happily provides people with whatever they need: milk,
   eggs, butter, even its own tasty self. With Amazon’s patented 1-Click
   shopping, which already knows your address and credit-card information,
   there’s just you and the BUY button; transactions are as quick and
   thoughtless as scratching an itch. “It’s sort of a masturbatory
   culture,” the marketing executive said. If you pay seventy-nine dollars
   annually to become an Amazon Prime member, a box with the Amazon smile
   appears at your door two days after you click, with free shipping.
   Amazon’s next frontier is same-day delivery: first in certain American
   cities, then throughout the U.S., then the world. In December, the
   company patented “anticipatory shipping,” which will use your shopping
   data to put items that you don’t yet know you want to buy, but will
   soon enough, on a truck or in a warehouse near you.

   Until recently, even taxes were airbrushed away. For years, Amazon
   fought furiously against paying sales taxes in states where it had no
   warehouses (and even where it did). California and other states, under
   pressure from retailers complaining about Amazon’s unfair advantage,
   passed online-sales-tax laws. Amazon, with fulfillment centers across
   the country, favors a national online-sales-tax policy, perhaps because
   smaller online rivals would find it overwhelming to navigate all the
   tax jurisdictions across the country.

   At Amazon.com, all the irritation and wasted time of a shopping
   expedition are gone—the search for a parking place, the surly floor
   clerk, the sold-out items, the perversely slow person ahead of you at
   checkout. You don’t have to think about how much the cashier, with her
   wrist in a splint, makes per hour. The Internet’s invisibility shields
   Amazon from some of the criticism directed at its archrival Walmart,
   with its all-too-human superstores. Online commerce allows even
   conscientious consumers to forget that other people are involved.

   Amazon employs or subcontracts tens of thousands of warehouse workers,
   with seasonal variation, often building its fulfillment centers in
   areas with high unemployment and low wages. Accounts from inside the
   centers describe the work of picking, boxing, and shipping books and
   dog food and beard trimmers as a high-tech version of the dehumanized
   factory floor satirized in Chaplin’s “Modern Times.” Pickers holding
   computerized handsets are perpetually timed and measured as they
   fast-walk up to eleven miles per shift around a million-square-foot
   warehouse, expected to collect orders in as little as thirty-three
   seconds. After watching footage taken by an undercover BBC reporter, a
   stress expert said, “The evidence shows increased risk of mental
   illness and physical illness.” The company says that its warehouse jobs
   are “similar to jobs in many other industries.”
   [140217_a17860-600.jpg] “It’s a soul patch, but luckily we’ve caught it
   early.”Buy or license »

   Last September, lawyers brought a class-action lawsuit against Amazon,
   on behalf of a warehouse worker in Pennsylvania named Neal Heimbach,
   for unpaid wages: employees at the fulfillment center outside Allentown
   must wait in line to pass through metal detectors, and submit their
   belongings to be searched, when they leave for lunch and at the end of
   their shift. The process takes ten to twenty minutes each time. Theft
   is a common concern in Amazon warehouses—no doubt, a knock-on effect of
   the absence of bonds between the company and the ever-shifting roster
   of low-paid employees.

   None of Amazon’s U.S. workers belong to unions, because the customer
   would suffer. A company executive told the Times that Amazon considers
   unions to be obstacles that would impede its ability to improve
   customer service. In 2011, the Allentown Morning Call published an
   investigative series with accounts of multiple ambulances being parked
   outside a warehouse during a heat wave, in order to ferry overcome
   workers to emergency rooms. Afterward, Amazon installed
   air-conditioners, although their arrival coincided with the expansion
   of grocery services. In any case, Amazon’s warehouse jobs are gradually
   being taken over by robots. Bezos recently predicted to a gobsmacked
   Charlie Rose that, in five years, packages will be delivered by small
   drones. Then Amazon will have eliminated the human factor from
   shopping, and we will finally be all alone with our purchases.

   The combination of ceaseless innovation and low-wage drudgery makes
   Amazon the epitome of a successful New Economy company. It’s hiring as
   fast as it can—nearly thirty thousand employees last year. But its
   brand of creative destruction might be killing more jobs than it makes.
   According to a recent study of U.S. Census data by the Institute for
   Local Self-Reliance, in Washington, brick-and-mortar retailers employ
   forty-seven people for every ten million dollars in revenue earned;
   Amazon employs fourteen.

   In the book industry, many of those formerly employed people staffed
   independent stores. Two decades ago, there were some four thousand in
   America, and many of them functioned as cultural centers where people
   browsed and exchanged ideas. Today, there are fewer than two
   thousand—although, with Borders dead and Barnes & Noble ailing, the
   indies are making a small comeback. Vivien Jennings, of Rainy Day
   Books, has been in business for thirty-eight years. “We know our
   customers, and the other independents are the same,” she said. “We know
   what they read better than any recommendation engine.”

   After Amazon’s legal triumph, some publishing people were driven to the
   wild surmise that the company had colluded with the Justice Department,
   if not micromanaged the entire case. They grasped at the fact that
   Jamie Gorelick, a deputy attorney general in the Clinton
   Administration, and a friend of Attorney General Eric Holder, serves on
   Amazon’s board, and that three weeks after Judge Cote’s decision
   President Barack Obama appeared at an Amazon warehouse in
   Chattanooga—where workers earn, on average, eleven dollars an hour—to
   praise the company’s creation of good jobs. The coup de grâce came last
   November, when the cash-strapped U.S. Postal Service announced a
   special partnership to deliver Amazon—and only Amazon—packages on
   Sundays, with the terms kept under official seal. To some people in the
   book world, Obama’s embrace of their nemesis felt like a betrayal. One
   literary agent said, “It’s strange that a President who’s an author,
   and whose primary income has come from being an author, was siding with
   a monopoly that wants to undercut publishers.”

   Since the arrival of the Kindle, the tension between Amazon and the
   publishers has become an open battle. The conflict reflects not only
   business antagonism amid technological change but a division between
   the two coasts, with different cultural styles and a philosophical
   disagreement about what techies call “disruption.”

   “Book publishing always has a rhetoric of the fallen age,” a senior
   editor at a major house told me. “It was always better before you got
   here. The tech guys—it’s always better if you just get out of my way
   and give me what I want. It’s always future-perfect.” He went on,
   “Their whole thing is ‘Let’s take somebody’s face and innovate on it.
   There’s an old lady—we don’t know we’re innovating unless she’s
   screaming.’ A lot of it is thoughtless innovation.”

   The senior editor, like most people in publishing, rarely deals
   directly with Amazon, but in the fall of 2010 he attended a meeting
   with Russ Grandinetti, the Kindle vice-president, who was visiting the
   big New York houses. Like Bezos, Grandinetti went to Princeton and
   worked on Wall Street. He joined Amazon in 1998, as treasurer, then
   moved on to apparel, before taking the Kindle job. An Amazon colleague
   described Grandinetti as the smartest guy in the room at a company
   where everyone believes himself to be just that. Many publishing types
   consider him a bully. The literary agent, who knows him, said, “When
   you spend time with Russ, you get the sense that he thinks publishers
   are idiots.”

   At the meeting, Grandinetti displayed some of Amazon’s number-free bar
   graphs and encouraged a faster move into digital publishing and online
   selling. “He gave this whole pitch,” the senior editor said. “ ‘It’s
   proprietary, I can’t show you, but everything that’s good for us is
   good for you—just do what we say.’ ”

   Grandinetti took questions, and an editor raised his hand. “I noticed
   you’ve announced Kindle Singles”—digital works of fiction and
   nonfiction, sold for a few dollars, that are too long for most
   magazines but shorter than books. “Which publishers are you working
   with?”

   “All publishers,” Grandinetti said.

   “All publishers are participating in the Kindle Singles program?”

   “Well, no. Amazon is the publisher.”

   The senior editor found it disturbing that Grandinetti couldn’t even be
   straight about a piece of public information. It showed contempt for
   his audience. “It was very practiced in a way that publishing people
   don’t do,” he said.

   When I spoke with Grandinetti, he expressed sympathy for publishers
   faced with upheaval. “The move to people reading digitally and buying
   books digitally is the single biggest change that any of us in the book
   business will experience in our time,” he said. “Because the change is
   particularly big in size, and because we happen to be a leader in
   making it, a lot of that fear gets projected onto us.” Bezos also
   argues that Amazon’s role is simply to usher in inevitable change.
   After giving “60 Minutes” a first glimpse of Amazon drone delivery,
   Bezos told Charlie Rose, “Amazon is not happening to bookselling. The
   future is happening to bookselling.”

   In Grandinetti’s view, the Kindle “has helped the book business make a
   more orderly transition to a mixed print and digital world than perhaps
   any other medium.” Compared with people who work in music, movies, and
   newspapers, he said, authors are well positioned to thrive. The old
   print world of scarcity—with a limited number of publishers and editors
   selecting which manuscripts to publish, and a limited number of
   bookstores selecting which titles to carry—is yielding to a world of
   digital abundance. Grandinetti told me that, in these new
   circumstances, a publisher’s job “is to build a megaphone.”

   After the Kindle came out, the company established Amazon Publishing,
   which is now a profitable empire of digital works: in addition to
   Kindle Singles, it has mystery, thriller, romance, and Christian lines;
   it publishes translations and reprints; it has a self-service
   fan-fiction platform; and it offers an extremely popular
   self-publishing platform. Authors become Amazon partners, earning up to
   seventy per cent in royalties, as opposed to the fifteen per cent that
   authors typically make on hardcovers. Bezos touts the biggest
   successes, such as Theresa Ragan, whose self-published thrillers and
   romances have been downloaded hundreds of thousands of times. But one
   survey found that half of all self-published authors make less than
   five hundred dollars a year.

   Grandinetti said that, because an unprecedented number of titles are
   available in an instant, “it’s never been a better time to be a
   reader.” At last year’s Frankfurt Book Fair, he warned publishers that
   they’d keep those readers only if the price of e-books stayed low;
   otherwise, consumers would switch to playing Angry Birds on their
   tablets. He told me that the growth of online reader networks, such as
   GoodReads, which Amazon owns, is a welcome development: “Suddenly,
   we’re not locked into hearing the opinions of a small number of
   reviewers in newspapers.” (Professional reviewers are fading out
   anyway, along with librarians and bookshop owners.) Listening to
   Grandinetti, I might have thought that Amazon’s role in this
   transformation was that of a literary nonprofit that existed to make
   authors happy by delivering their books to as many readers as possible
   while keeping online gaming at bay—that is, by being a shmoo for book
   people.

   Amazon has made it possible for hundreds of thousands of writers
   frustrated with the limits of traditional publishing to have their work
   read. David Blum, who edits Kindle Singles, cited a
   twenty-eight-thousand-word memoir, by a journalist named Oliver Broudy,
   about travelling with a collector of Gandhi memorabilia. It had been
   turned down by several magazines, but since Blum accepted it, in March,
   2011, it has sold forty-five thousand units. More than five hundred
   Kindle Singles have appeared in less than three years—three or four a
   week, making it hard for even an experienced editor like Blum to do
   much more than read and publish them.
   [140217_a18024-600.jpg] “Fifth hand. Pale chartreuse.”Buy or license »

   The business term for all this clear-cutting is “disintermediation”:
   the elimination of the “gatekeepers,” as Bezos calls the professionals
   who get in the customer’s way. There’s a populist inflection to
   Amazon’s propaganda, an argument against élitist institutions and for
   “the democratization of the means of production”—a common line of
   thought in the West Coast tech world. Amazon executives speak of the
   “Rust Belt media,” comparing book publishing to the steel industry in
   the seventies. “Even well-meaning gatekeepers slow innovation,” Bezos
   wrote in his 2011 letter to shareholders. “When a platform is
   self-service, even the improbable ideas can get tried, because there’s
   no expert gatekeeper ready to say ‘that will never work!’ ”
   Nevertheless, MacKenzie Bezos published her recent novel, “Traps,” with
   Knopf.

   In May, 2011, Amazon announced that Laurence Kirshbaum, a longtime
   publisher of mass-market books and the former C.E.O. of Time Warner
   Books, would run a new trade division of Amazon Publishing, in New
   York. John Sargent sent Kirshbaum—who was liked, if not widely
   respected, in the industry—a terse e-mail: “Say it ain’t so.”

   The next day, they ran into each other at BookExpo, in the Javits
   Center. “John, I love you,” Kirshbaum said. “Be happy for my success.”

   “Larry, let me be clear with you,” Sargent said. “I hope you fail.”

   Amazon Publishing, which had been releasing mysteries and other genres
   in bulk, hoped that Kirshbaum would attract big-name authors and
   publish best-sellers. But top writers proved surprisingly loyal to
   their gatekeepers, and Amazon had to spend a lot of money on two
   dubious projects: a million dollars for “The 4-Hour Chef,” by the
   self-help guru Timothy Ferriss, and eight hundred thousand dollars for
   “My Mother Was Nuts,” a memoir by Penny Marshall, the “Laverne &
   Shirley” star. In hardcover, Ferriss’s book has sold a fraction of the
   numbers of his two earlier self-help books; Marshall’s has sold
   seventeen thousand. Nearly all of Amazon’s other books have fared
   worse: “Actors Anonymous,” a novel by James Franco, has sold fewer than
   five thousand. (Amazon claims to have sold many more copies of these
   titles as e-books.) In the past year, Amazon Publishing has barely been
   a presence at auctions, and several editors have departed; last month,
   Kirshbaum left the company, having failed at the task Amazon gave him.
   The new publisher, Daphne Durham, has spent her entire career at
   Amazon, and will remain in Seattle. Grandinetti, keeping his game face
   on, told me, “Amazon Publishing is off to a very good start.”

   There was a practical reason for the failure. Hardcover copies were
   printed and distributed in a partnership with Houghton Mifflin
   Harcourt, under an imprint called New Harvest, with Amazon’s name
   missing from the spine. But bookstores weren’t fooled. Barnes & Noble
   and nearly all the independents refused to stock its books—why help
   their mortal enemy?—and none of the titles gained enough momentum to
   force the stores to relent.

   What’s more, in its hurry to show up New York publishers, Amazon didn’t
   seem to know what it was doing. “There are certain things it takes to
   be a publisher,” the head of one New York house said, hardly concealing
   his Schadenfreude. “You have to have luck, but you also have to have
   judgment, discernment. I have no sense of the character of their
   house. . . . We care more than they do. Bezos has moved on to diapers
   and jewelry—we’re still doing books.”

   A former Amazon employee who worked in the Kindle division said that
   few of his colleagues in Seattle had a real interest in books: “You
   never heard people say, ‘Hey, what are you reading?’ Everyone there is
   so engineering-oriented. They don’t know how to talk to novelists.” The
   marketing executive pointed out that Amazon is a fast-moving company,
   but publishing is slow. “It’s like the difference between trolling and
   fly-fishing,” he said.

   “Book publishing is a very human business, and Amazon is driven by
   algorithms and scale,” Sargent told me. When a house gets behind a new
   book, “well over two hundred people are pushing your book all over the
   place, handing it to people, talking about it. A mass of humans, all in
   one place, generating tremendous energy—that’s the magic potion of
   publishing. . . . That’s pretty hard to replicate in Amazon’s
   publishing world, where they have hundreds of thousands of titles.”

   Amazon’s entry into publishing has created an awkward divide, giving
   some book people a second or a third chance in an imperilled industry
   while tainting them in the eyes of others. The literary agent,
   contemplating the future of the editors currently at Amazon, said,
   “You’d have to consider the time you spent with Vichy when you’re
   looking for work after the occupation.” Benjamin Anastas, a novelist
   who couldn’t find an American publisher for his third book, told a
   friend that he was going to publish his fourth, a memoir called “Too
   Good to Be True,” with Amazon. The friend, a novelist who had once
   worked at Harcourt—the house that distributed Amazon’s hardcover
   editions—looked stricken. “You do that,” she said, and walked away.
   Anastas found the reaction hypocritical. “If you’re publishing with
   Penguin Random House, what’s the difference?” he said. “They’re both
   these massive entities that have totally changed book publishing. There
   is nothing more demoralizing for a writer than to go into one of these
   huge towers to talk about your book amid all this product. You feel
   like a sperm-oil salesman at the Petroleum Club.” Still, finding no
   copies of his new book in most stores was akin to watching himself
   disappear, and Anastas said that he would think twice before publishing
   with Amazon again.

   Jon Fine, an intellectual-property lawyer, worked as Knopf’s in-house
   counsel until Amazon hired him, in 2005. Since 2008, he’s been the
   company’s director of author-and-publisher relations—“trying to get
   publishers to hate Amazon less,” as an arts manager said. In March,
   2009, Slate criticized Amazon for its miserly philanthropy, especially
   in the Seattle arts world, saying that certain lemonade stands were
   more generous. Fine showed the article around, and the next day a
   printed copy came back to him, with “Fix This” scrawled across the page
   in Bezos’s hand, and a budget of roughly a million dollars attached.
   (Amazon denies this.)

   Every year, Fine distributes grants of twenty-five thousand dollars, on
   average, to dozens of hard-up literary organizations. Beneficiaries
   include the PEN American Center, the Loft Literary Center, in
   Minneapolis, and the magazine Poets & Writers. “For Amazon, it’s the
   cost of doing business, like criminal penalties for banks,” the arts
   manager said, suggesting that the money keeps potential critics quiet.
   Like liberal Democrats taking Wall Street campaign contributions, the
   nonprofits don’t advertise the grants. When the Best Translated Book
   Award received money from Amazon, Dennis Johnson, of Melville House,
   which had received the prize that year, announced that his firm would
   no longer compete for it. “Every translator in America wrote me saying
   I was a son of a bitch,” Johnson said. A few nonprofit heads privately
   told him, “I wanted to speak out, but I might have taken four thousand
   dollars from them, too.” A year later, at the Associated Writing
   Programs conference, Fine shook Johnson’s hand, saying, “I just wanted
   to thank you—that was the best publicity we could have had.” (Fine
   denies this.)

   Serious publishing is in such a dire state that thoughtful people are
   defecting to Amazon. There’s a line in Robert Stone’s novel “A Flag for
   Sunrise” about “a mouse so frightened it went to the cat for love.” The
   cat can inspire inordinate gratitude when it lets the mouse live. “I
   feel like, I get to do this!” an editor who has joined Amazon said. “I
   can’t believe it—I’m still standing! I can’t monitor other people’s
   feelings, but I can’t see what harm I’m doing.”

   By producing its own original work, Amazon can sell more devices and
   sign up more Prime members—a major source of revenue. While the company
   was building the Kindle, it started a digital store for streaming music
   and videos, and, around the same time it launched Amazon Publishing, it
   created Amazon Studios.

   The division pursued an unusual way of producing television series,
   using its strength in data collection. Amazon invited writers to submit
   scripts on its Web site—“an open platform for content creators,” as
   Bill Carr, the vice-president for digital music and video, put it. Five
   thousand scripts poured in, and Amazon chose to develop fourteen into
   pilots. Last spring, Amazon put the pilots on its site, where customers
   could review them and answer a detailed questionnaire. (“Please rate

   More than a million customers watched. Engineers also developed
   software, called Amazon Storyteller, which scriptwriters can use to
   create a “storyboard animatic”—a cartoon rendition of a script’s
   plot—allowing pilots to be visualized without the expense of filming.
   The difficulty, according to Carr, is to “get the right feedback and
   the right data, and, of the many, many data points that I can collect
   from customers, which ones can tell you, ‘This is the one’?”

   Like the publishing venture, Amazon Studios set out to make the old
   “gatekeepers”—in this case, Hollywood agents and executives—obsolete.
   “We let the data drive what to put in front of customers,” Carr told
   the Wall Street Journal. “We don’t have tastemakers deciding what our
   customers should read, listen to, and watch.”

   Steve Jobs once remarked that customers don’t know what they want until
   Apple shows them. Amazon’s view is nearly the opposite, which has made
   it the world’s largest online store. But determining customers’ desires
   by analyzing surveys and viewing patterns does not describe a path to
   artistic excellence.

   When Garry Trudeau, the creator of the “Doonesbury” comic strip, heard
   from his friend Jonathan Alter, the author and political journalist,
   that Amazon was interested in a script that Trudeau had written—a
   comedy, “Alpha House,” about four Republican senators living together
   on Capitol Hill—he was dubious: “Amazon is a studio?” Trudeau’s
   skepticism turned to horror when Alter described Amazon’s approach.
   “Being one of thousands of projects didn’t seem very promising,”
   Trudeau said. “Hanging it up on the Amazon Prime Web site and letting
   it be troll bait didn’t appeal at all. I thought it would be a very
   public humiliation, as opposed to the usual way pilots get shot down—in
   private with executives.”

   Trudeau went ahead with Amazon, anyway, with Alter as an executive
   producer. “For me, this was a chance to feel like I had a piece of the
   dawning digital age,” Alter, whose longtime employer, Newsweek, had
   been sold for a dollar, said. After the pilot, starring John Goodman,
   appeared on Amazon, last April, almost four thousand customer reviews
   came in. Trudeau didn’t read them—“It was not good for my mental
   health, so instead I looked at the percentages, since I figured that’s
   what Amazon was looking at.” The ratings were largely positive, and in
   May Amazon Studios commissioned Trudeau to write ten episodes of “Alpha
   House.”

   “Now, of course, I’m all for the process,” Trudeau said, smiling. “Yay,
   democracy!”

   “Alpha House” had a glitzy première, on November 11th, at the
   Metropolitan Museum of Art, with young women in black checking guests’
   names on Kindles. Bezos attended, with his parents seated next to
   Trudeau. “Alpha House” became popular on Amazon Prime streaming video,
   but it garnered less critical praise and public interest than “House of
   Cards,” from Amazon’s rival Netflix. “Betas,” Amazon’s second original
   series, about four friends with a social-app startup, was a bomb. Many
   more shows are in the pipeline (including a New Yorker project
   developed by Condé Nast Entertainment).

   For all the emphasis on crowdsourcing, Trudeau said, almost all the
   shows that Amazon approved were created by professionals. “They may be
   spinning their wheels with all their data crunching,” he said. “You can
   easily argue that it stymies experimentation, that it prevents
   innovation, because the audience is telling you what they want.” But
   Trudeau was free to ignore the data from “Alpha House”—Amazon kept it
   confidential even from him.

   Last August, Bezos bought the Washington Post from the Graham family,
   for a quarter of a billion dollars. The purchase didn’t involve Amazon,
   and Bezos’s decision seems unrelated to his company or to a search for
   profits. “The core business of Amazon would dictate against buying the
   Post,” Barry Diller, the media mogul, who sat on the newspaper’s board
   until it was sold to Bezos, said. “No matter what you do with the Post,
   it is primarily a print publication. Amazon’s ambitions in content
   don’t go to news and information at all.”

   Nor has Bezos shown much interest in politics, except as it involves
   his business. A moderate libertarian, he has donated money to oppose a
   “millionaires’ tax” in Washington State, and to support gay marriage.
   Shel Kaphan, Bezos’s former deputy, remembers him repeating Thomas
   Jefferson’s quote about the best government being the least government,
   but Kaphan worries more about Bezos applying his “take no prisoners”
   pragmatism to the Post: “There are conflicts of interest with Amazon’s
   many contracts with the government, and he’s got so many policy issues
   going, like sales tax.” One ex-employee who worked closely with Bezos
   warned, “At Amazon, drawing a distinction between content people and
   business people is a foreign concept.”

   Perhaps buying the Post was meant to be a good civic deed. Bezos has a
   family foundation, but he has hardly involved himself in philanthropy.
   In 2010, Charlie Rose asked him what he thought of Bill Gates’s
   challenge to other billionaires to give away most of their wealth.
   Bezos didn’t answer. Instead, he launched into a monologue on the
   virtue of markets in solving social problems, and somehow ended up
   touting the Kindle.

   Bezos bought a newspaper for much the same reason that he has invested
   money in a project for commercial space travel: the intellectual
   challenge. With the Post, the challenge is to turn around a
   money-losing enterprise in a damaged industry, and perhaps to show a
   way for newspapers to thrive again. When Bezos visited the paper in
   September, he told several hundred staffers what they hoped to hear:
   that their primary customers were readers (not advertisers), that news
   should drive business decisions, and that cutting the news budget was
   suicidal. He mentioned recent articles he’d liked, including one, by
   the blogger Max Fisher, headlined “9 QUESTIONS ABOUT SYRIA YOU WERE TOO
   EMBARRASSED TO ASK.” He frequently used the word “bundle,” suggesting
   that readers should be induced to subscribe to the whole paper instead
   of finding stray articles through Web searches. “My job is to provide a
   runway until we take off,” Bezos said.

   On January 16th, Bezos visited the paper again. It was kept secret from
   everyone at the Post except a few top editors and executives. Bezos is
   bringing Amazon’s obsession with secrecy to a paper known for its
   openness. At Amazon’s Seattle headquarters, the floor devoted to the
   Kindle is known as Area 51, because it’s off limits to everyone not
   involved in the product. When one Amazon employee attended an
   orientation meeting several years ago, and another new hire declared
   that she had just come from the National Security Agency, he wondered
   how she would fit in. “It took me a few weeks,” the employee said. “She
   was going to fit in a lot better than I was.” Bezos’s aversion to
   scrutiny runs so deep that it is bound to create problems for newspaper
   people whose job is to expose what powerful institutions want to hide.

   On his January visit, Bezos discussed the paper’s design for tablets.
   He also summoned Henry Blodget, the former securities analyst who, in
   2003, was charged with civil fraud and barred from the industry; in
   2007, he became the C.E.O. of Business Insider, a Web magazine in which
   Bezos is a major investor. Blodget spoke to senior staff at the Post
   about the challenges of publishing news on the Internet. In a recent
   interview with the Times, he said, “Digital journalism is as different
   from print and TV journalism as print and TV are from each other.”

   Two weeks after Bezos’s visit, the Post’s editor, Martin Baron,
   announced that the 2014 budget included funds for a Web-site redesign
   and provided more money for political reporting, the Sunday magazine,
   and digital content. It wasn’t enough to prevent the exodus of Ezra
   Klein, Max Fisher, and other prominent bloggers, who have left for Vox
   Media. For journalists who remain at the Post, the hope generated by
   Bezos’s purchase is, in part, a sign of their desperate situation.
   Bezos must know how to fix the newspaper business, the thinking goes,
   because he’s a titan of the digital world that helped lay waste to it.
   “The arrogance level in Silicon Valley is very high,” a former senior
   editor said. “The reality is they don’t have the beginning of an
   answer.”

   Book publishers’ dependence on Amazon, however unwilling, keeps
   growing. Amazon constitutes a third of one major house’s retail sales
   on a given week, with the growth chart pointing toward fifty per cent.
   By contrast, independents represent under ten per cent, and one New
   York editor said that only a third of the three thousand
   brick-and-mortar bookstores still in existence would remain financially
   healthy if publishers didn’t waive certain terms of payment. Jane
   Friedman, the former Random House and HarperCollins executive, who now
   runs a digital publisher called Open Road Integrated Media, told me,
   “If there wasn’t an Amazon today, there probably wouldn’t be a book
   business.” The senior editor who met Grandinetti said, “They’re our
   biggest customer, we want them to succeed. As I recover from being
   punched in the face by Amazon, I also worry: What if they are a bubble?
   What if the stock market suddenly says, ‘We want a profit’? You don’t
   want your father who abuses you physically to lose his job.”

   Publishers are less like abused minors and more like financially
   insecure adults who rely on the support of a bullying uncle. Their
   dependence breeds bad faith. “Privately, we berate Amazon,” the
   marketing executive said. “Yet we’re always trying to figure out how to
   work with them.”

   The Big Six recently became the Big Five, with the merger of Random
   House and Penguin, which created the largest publishing house in the
   world. Several industry people told me that it was intended to provide
   Penguin Random House, as the new company is called, with more
   bargaining power against Amazon. But book publishers have been
   consolidating for several decades, under the ownership of media
   conglomerates like News Corporation, which squeeze them for profits, or
   holding companies such as Rivergroup, which strip them to service debt.
   The effect of all this corporatization, as with the replacement of
   independent booksellers by superstores, has been to privilege the
   blockbuster. Penguin Random House and Barnes & Noble are hardly Davids
   to Amazon’s Goliath. “It’s like you turn into your enemy,” the head of
   one New York house said. “Publishers are in a bad position to be
   representing themselves as speaking for the artists.”

   Lately, digital titles have levelled off at about thirty per cent of
   book sales. Whatever the temporary fluctuations in publishers’ profits,
   the long-term outlook is discouraging. This is partly because Americans
   don’t read as many books as they used to—they are too busy doing other
   things with their devices—but also because of the relentless downward
   pressure on prices that Amazon enforces. The digital market is awash
   with millions of barely edited titles, most of it dreck, while readers
   are being conditioned to think that books are worth as little as a
   sandwich. “Amazon has successfully fostered the idea that a book is a
   thing of minimal value,” Johnson said. “It’s a widget.”

   There are two ways to think about this. Amazon believes that its
   approach encourages ever more people to tell their stories to ever more
   people, and turns writers into entrepreneurs; the price per unit might
   be cheap, but the higher number of units sold, and the accompanying
   royalties, will make authors wealthier. Jane Friedman, of Open Road, is
   unfazed by the prospect that Amazon might destroy the old model of
   publishing. “They are practicing the American Dream—competition is
   good!” she told me. Publishers, meanwhile, “have been banks for
   authors. Advances have been very high.” In Friedman’s view, selling
   digital books at low prices will democratize reading: “What do you want
   as an author—to sell books to as few people as possible for as much as
   possible, or for as little as possible to as many readers as possible?”

   The answer seems self-evident, but there is a more skeptical view.
   Several editors, agents, and authors told me that the money for serious
   fiction and nonfiction has eroded dramatically in recent years;
   advances on mid-list titles—books that are expected to sell modestly
   but whose quality gives them a strong chance of enduring—have declined
   by a quarter. These are the kinds of book that particularly benefit
   from the attention of editors and marketers, and that attract gifted
   people to publishing, despite the pitiful salaries. Without sufficient
   advances, many writers will not be able to undertake long, difficult,
   risky projects. Those who do so anyway will have to expend a lot of
   effort mastering the art of blowing their own horn. “Writing is being
   outsourced, because the only people who can afford to write books make
   money elsewhere—academics, rich people, celebrities,” Colin Robinson, a
   veteran publisher, said. “The real talent, the people who are writers
   because they happen to be really good at writing—they aren’t going to
   be able to afford to do it.”

   Seven-figure bidding wars still break out over potential blockbusters,
   even though these battles often turn out to be follies. The quest for
   publishing profits in an economy of scarcity drives the money toward a
   few big books. So does the gradual disappearance of book reviewers and
   knowledgeable booksellers, whose enthusiasm might have rescued a book
   from drowning in obscurity. When consumers are overwhelmed with
   choices, some experts argue, they all tend to buy the same well-known
   thing.

   These trends point toward what the literary agent called “the rich
   getting richer, the poor getting poorer.” A few brand names at the top,
   a mass of unwashed titles down below, the middle hollowed out: the book
   business in the age of Amazon mirrors the widening inequality of the
   broader economy.

   In 2009, after a career at publishers large and small, Robinson was
   laid off by Scribner, amid downsizing. Faced with his own professional
   extinction, and perhaps the industry’s, he co-founded a new company, OR
   Books, with a different business model. Robinson did research and found
   that fifty to sixty per cent of the list price of a book goes to Amazon
   or to another retailer. When he was starting out, in the eighties, that
   figure was more like thirty or forty per cent. A small-to-midsize
   publisher has to spend between ten and fifteen per cent on sales,
   warehousing, and shipping. This leaves little more than twenty-five per
   cent of the book’s price for editorial counsel, production costs,
   publicity, paying the author, and whatever profit might be left over. A
   shared sensibility for a certain kind of fiction or nonfiction writing
   unites everyone along the way: authors, agents, editors, designers,
   marketers, reviewers, readers. “The only point at which Bezos enters
   that chain is to take all the money and the e-mail address of the
   buyer,” Robinson said. “There’s an entire community of people, and
   Bezos stands in the middle of it and collects the money.”

   Instead of going through Amazon, OR Books sells directly to customers,
   using printers in Minnesota and the U.K. It pays about fifteen per cent
   to the printer and keeps the rest. “After four years, we’re just
   profitable,” Robinson told me. “It works.”

   To the Big Five, locked in a death struggle with Amazon and the
   distracted American reader, this kind of experimentation might seem
   unrealistic. To survive, they are trying to broaden their distribution
   channels, not narrow them. But Andrew Wylie thinks that it’s exactly
   what a giant like Penguin Random House should do. “If they did, in my
   opinion they would save the industry. They’d lose thirty per cent of
   their sales, but they would have an additional thirty per cent for
   every copy they sold, because they’d be selling directly to consumers.
   The industry thinks of itself as Procter & Gamble*. What gave
   publishers the idea that this was some big goddam business? It’s
   not—it’s a tiny little business, selling to a bunch of odd people who
   read.”

   At the moment, those people are obsessed with how they read
   books—whether it’s on a Kindle or an iPad or on printed pages. This
   conversation, though important, takes place in the shallows and misses
   the deeper currents that, in the digital age, are pushing American
   culture under the control of ever fewer and more powerful corporations.
   Bezos is right: gatekeepers are inherently élitist, and some of them
   have been weakened, in no small part, because of their complacency and
   short-term thinking. But gatekeepers are also barriers against the
   complete commercialization of ideas, allowing new talent the time to
   develop and learn to tell difficult truths. When the last gatekeeper
   but one is gone, will Amazon care whether a book is any good? ♦
