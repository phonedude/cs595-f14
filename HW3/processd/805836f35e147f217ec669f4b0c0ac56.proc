Our Rover on Mars Looked Into the Sky and Saw Earth

   We had "Blue Marble" and "Pale Blue Dot"—now we have an "evening star."

   Earth, from the surface of Mars, photographed by the rover
   Curiosity (NASA / JPL)

   Sometime last week, the Mars Curiosity Rover, the two-year-old American
   craft about the size of a minivan, turned its camera skyward. There,
   over a dune, it saw a shining evening star that was no star at all.

   It saw us—it saw Earth.

   Our home planet, with us aboard, shines a little brighter in the sky on
   Mars than Venus does here. In the picture from last week, Curiosity can
   see both the Earth and the moon. Neither twinkles, like a star would;
   they both shine, reflecting the sun’s light.
   NASA / JPL

   NASA has processed the images to remove the effects of cosmic rays. But
   seeing the Earth and the moon would be easier on Mars than it seems
   from the picture above.

   “A human observer with normal vision, if standing on Mars, could easily
   see Earth and the moon as two distinct, bright ‘evening stars,’” reads
   the agency’s website.

   Curiosity isn’t the first rover to see Earth from the surface of Mars.
   In 2004, the American rover Spirit saw a shining Earth in the dawn sky.
   The quality of its picture wasn’t as good as the one above, though.
   “Earth was too faint to be detected in images taken with the panoramic
   camera's color filters,” a specialist wrote at the time, so the images
   released were black and white.

   rover in 2004 (NASA)

   In the pictures from last week, though, Earth can be seen glowing in a
   dark blue sky. It makes me think about scale. In the late 1960s,
   activists hungered for a “whole Earth” picture of our home planet. We
   now have many pictures like that—photographed from orbit, like imagery
   in Google Earth, or from the edge of the solar system, like Carl
   Sagan’s famous “pale blue dot.”

   Below, I’ve arranged and annotated those pictures. All are Earth; each
   was taken by a photographer a little more distant.

   Apollo 17 in December 1972 (NASA) An October 2007 image, captured from
   NASA's Mars Reconnoissance Orbiter while rotating around the red
   planet, of Earth and its moon (NASA) Earth from the Martian surface, as
   photographed on January 31, 2014 (NASA) In 1990, 3.7 billion miles away
   from Earth and departing the immediate solar system, Voyage 1 captured
   this image of Earth in space—a “pale blue dot.” (NASA)
