   I'm leaving Mojang I don’t see myself as a real game developer. I make
   games because it’s fun, and because I love games and I love to program,
   but I don’t make games with the intention of them becoming huge hits,
   and I don’t try to change the world. Minecraft certainly became a huge
   hit, and people are telling me it’s changed games. I never meant for it
   to do either. It’s certainly flattering, and to gradually get thrust
   into some kind of public spotlight is interesting. A relatively long
   time ago, I decided to step down from Minecraft development. Jens was
   the perfect person to take over leading it, and I wanted to try to do
   new things. At first, I failed by trying to make something big again,
   but since I decided to just stick to small prototypes and interesting
   challenges, I’ve had so much fun with work. I wasn’t exactly sure how I
   fit into Mojang where people did actual work, but since people said I
   was important for the culture, I stayed. I was at home with a bad cold
   a couple of weeks ago when the internet exploded with hate against me
   over some kind of EULA situation that I had nothing to do with. I was
   confused. I didn’t understand. I tweeted this in frustration. Later on,
   I watched the This is Phil Fish video on YouTube and started to realize
   I didn’t have the connection to my fans I thought I had. I’ve become a
   symbol. I don’t want to be a symbol, responsible for something huge
   that I don’t understand, that I don’t want to work on, that keeps
   coming back to me. I’m not an entrepreneur. I’m not a CEO. I’m a nerdy
   computer programmer who likes to have opinions on Twitter. As soon as
   this deal is finalized, I will leave Mojang and go back to doing Ludum
   Dares and small web experiments. If I ever accidentally make something
   that seems to gain traction, I’ll probably abandon it immediately.
   Considering the public image of me already is a bit skewed, I don’t
   expect to get away from negative comments by doing this, but at least
   now I won’t feel a responsibility to read them. I’m aware this goes
   against a lot of what I’ve said in public. I have no good response to
   that. I’m also aware a lot of you were using me as a symbol of some
   perceived struggle. I’m not. I’m a person, and I’m right there
   struggling with you. I love you. All of you. Thank you for turning
   Minecraft into what it has become, but there are too many of you, and I
   can’t be responsible for something this big. In one sense, it belongs
   to Microsoft now. In a much bigger sense, it’s belonged to all of you
   for a long time, and that will never change. It’s not about the money.
   It’s about my sanity.
