   In 1692 an artist known only as ‚ÄúA. Boogert‚Äù sat down to write a book
   in Dutch about mixing watercolors. Not only would he begin the book
   with a bit about the use of color in painting, but would go on to
   explain how to create certain hues and change the tone by adding one,
   two, or three parts of water. The premise sounds simple enough, but the
   final product is almost unfathomable in its detail and scope.

   Spanning nearly 800 completely handwritten (and painted) pages, Trait√©
   des couleurs servant √† la peinture √† l‚Äôeau, was probably the most
   comprehensive guide to paint and color of its time. According to
   Medieval book historian Erik Kwakkel who translated part of the
   introduction, the color book was intended as an educational guide. The
   irony being there was only a single copy that was probably seen by very
   few eyes.

   It‚Äôs hard not to compare the hundreds of pages of color to its
   contemporary equivalent, the Pantone Color Guide, which wouldn‚Äôt be
   published for the first time until 1963.

   The entire book is viewable in high resolution here, and you can read a
   description of it here (it appears E-Corpus might have crashed for the
   moment). The book is currently kept at the Biblioth√®que M√©janes in
   Aix-en-Provence, France. (via Erik Kwakkel)
