   Everyone’s racing to build the “god platform” for the Internet of
   Things: the highest, most generalized layer of intelligence and user
   interface that ties together connected devices and web services.

   It’s tempting to look for analogy in mobile phone platforms, where
   Apple was initially dominant and now enjoys an extremely lucrative and
   influential minority position against Android. There are some crucial
   differences, though. For starters, adoption won’t be quite as easy;
   domestic appliances last for a long time, and nothing consumers have
   seen yet makes connected laundry seem appealing enough to justify early
   replacement of a washing machine. And even in cases where replacement
   is relatively easy, the grandest promises entail stitching everything
   into a seamless system — replacing just the easy stuff can seem pretty
   lame.

   Mobile phones initially channeled existing behavior (Facebook on a
   desktop browser) into the convenience of availability anywhere
   (Facebook on a mobile app). The jump from light switch to mobile app is
   much more dramatic, and, frankly, light switches are a pretty refined
   and satisfactory technology.

   So, companies that want to participate in the home automation market
   will need to create products that work compellingly in isolation and
   alongside competitors’ products — and somewhere in all of this, the god
   platform might emerge.

   A dialogue about this arose in a long e-mail chain among the Solid team
   over the weekend. I’ve edited and excerpted some of it below; we’d
   welcome additions to it in the comments section.

   The conversation began when Tim O’Reilly shared this Slashdot item:

     “Household devices are getting smarter these days: the so-called
     Internet of Things is bringing software-controlled thermostats,
     lighting, and other appliances into the mainstream. Many companies
     are fighting for a piece of the pie, but Logitech is taking a
     different approach…they’re trying to build remotes that will
     control all of a home’s smart devices. ‘Logitech doesn’t want to own
     the device; it wants to own the app experience. But to do that, it
     had to build a software overlay and a controller that would convince
     people to put it in their homes. So, it’s offering a $100 hub that
     combines IR, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and RF that will let you use the
     Logitech Harmony app to control gear that uses those
     protocols.’…They’ve worked out partnerships with a lot of companies
     that are big in the home, like Nest, Honeywell, and Philips, all of
     whom seem to want this extra layer of control for the user.

   Mike Loukides:

     Interesting. This has to happen — it’s hard to imagine a world in
     which every device has its own app. I wish it were happening via
     standard protocols, and I’m not convinced that trying to do deals
     with each device vendor is going to be anything except for a
     nightmare. But if nothing else, maybe this will start the protocol
     conversation.

   Me (Jon Bruner):

     I’m surprised that Nest, Honeywell, Philips, etc., are willing to
     let Logitech “own the app experience.” I mean, I think someone will
     eventually emerge and own the whole app experience, but that seems
     like the most valuable part of the system — the part that’s most
     likely to produce integrated, insightful data at the highest level.
     It’s something I’d expect these vendors to fight over, but maybe
     they see the lack of an integrated experience as a barrier to
     adoption.

   Luis Galvez:

     There isn’t much integration work on the part of the companies,
     which is why Logitech threw every wireless radio in the box.

     That said, it doesn’t go far enough — the promise of IoT is about
     the experience, not just a universal remote for all your things.
     Many companies are trying a “whole” app approach, like the Works
     with Nest program, Google’s Thread group, etc. What the Apple
     experience will do that I think ultimately will force companies to
     join is Apple will have both the hub element with Homekit/Apple TV
     and the key always-on-you product with iPhone/Apple Watch that
     connects to all of these devices while you’re at home. From here, a
     whole ecosystem of services through apps can emerge that bridge the
     interactions with Homekit (a la IFTTT) to eventually
     anticipate/predict your patterns and bring you real value. It’s the
     Internet of Me. A few sensors in the home aren’t enough to
     guide this experience, as companies like Nest are learning in
     dealing with multiple people and pets.

   Mike Loukides:

     So, do you think Apple is the big winner here? Not saying they will
     be, though I hate the idea of living in a walled garden that’s owned
     by Apple. But they arguably understand “experience” better than
     anyone else out there. (Though, increasingly I think that what they
     really understand is branding and brand marketing.)

   David Cranor:

     I think that Apple is pretty well positioned. This stuff is all
     about adoption of an entire network of compatible
     devices/services/user behaviors in a pretty short time frame, and
     they’ve been building their ownership of people’s entire home device
     ecosystem for years. They own the screens in people’s pockets, laps,
     (some) television stands, and are making the strongest effort thus
     far at the wrist. They’re also doing deals with car manufacturers
     for in-car media systems. They know the specs of these devices,
     protocols they talk on, and own the software that connects them,
     already.

     Also, interface is really a big deal on this stuff — like Luis was
     saying, it’s about the experience. It needs to be like a butler —
     anticipating your patterns but staying out of the way.

     I like those always-on voice control boxes, but I don’t know if
     people are ready for them yet. I don’t think that most people want
     to feel like they are living inside a computer; they want to feel
     like stuff just works better and that there is more information
     there if they want it. But the physical interface can’t feel
     foreign. Nest is a really great example of design with this
     principle in mind.

     I’ll get really excited when someone commercializes this tech:
     http://web.media.mit.edu/…
     http://courses.cs.washington.edu/…

     Then all of your stuff could know what you were doing just by the
     manner in which you touched it. I mean, come on — there’s totally
     enough information to know that you want to pair your new wireless
     speaker to your phone in the way that you interact with those
     objects naturally. You pick up the speaker, turn it on, then touch
     the thing you want to pair it with less than a second later. You
     could also do even weirder stuff like connect your pacemaker to
     IFTTT.

     If only there were a standardized smart wristband that everyone was
     wearing to serve as the mediator of information between the users’
     standardized set of connected devices…

   Tim O’Reilly:

     I disagree that Apple owns people’s phones (iPhone has pretty small
     share now, albeit a lot of profits), or that they yet own the wrist.
     Their wristwatch share will always be some subset of smartphone
     share, and again, Android is way ahead on smartphone share. And the
     Android Wear watches are pretty darn awesome (if not yet as
     beautiful).

     Further, this all requires a big data competency that Apple hasn’t
     demonstrated. Google Now is light years ahead of Siri on that front.

     I don’t know who’s where on the TV front, or the car front, but I
     think the Android OEM strategy will trump, just like it did on
     smartphones, and years ago in PC vs Mac, and before that in Sony
     Betamax vs VHS. Apple is ultimately Sony.

     I’ll grant that it’s a horse race, but I’d say that the odds are
     against Apple. I see them helping create and validate new
     categories, but ultimately falling behind.

   Mike Loukides:

     Another issue that weighs against Apple in the long run (and is part
     of Tim’s argument) is that Apple is all about a “luxury” market,
     about people willing to pay $600 or $700 for a watch (or a phone).
     They’ve never shown much interest in the less luxury-oriented part
     of the consumer market — and really, they can’t: if you own the
     luxury market, the best way to stop owning it is to pollute your
     brand with commodity products. (Apple’s real genius is probably to
     make commodity products that are luxury products.)

     So, there is certainly a significant market out there for $600
     phones, and a large number of people willing to pay several times
     that for home automation products. But over the long run, smart
     homes are going to penetrate into the middle (and maybe even the low
     end) of the market. Apple isn’t interested in that, and really can’t
     be interested in that, because it would compromise their hold on the
     high-end market.

     The only way out would be to create a separate label, just as GM
     owns both Chevy and Cadillac. But that would be very un-Apple, and
     it usually works the other way around: Volkswagen owns Porsche and
     Bentley, not vice-versa.

   Jon Bruner:

     You’re correct about the luxury positioning here, and I think that
     doesn’t necessarily weigh against Apple at the outset. For the next
     couple of years, at least, home automation will be a luxury market,
     and that’s the period in which influence will be established, if not
     market share. Recall that smartphones were a somewhat unusual luxury
     product for the first year or two that the iPhone was out; I think
     the fact that they’re now ubiquitous in developed countries is owed
     to Apple establishing a market, and Apple is still incredibly
     influential in this area, even though its market share has been
     shrinking since the early iPhone era.

     By home automation as a luxury market, by the way, I don’t mean that
     it’s particularly expensive or inaccessible — just that most of
     these products are (or appear to consumers to be) entirely
     discretionary. Lockitron and Nest are cool, but there are plenty of
     other things that Americans are preoccupied with that cost less than
     $180 or $250, and connectivity on things like washing machines is
     still an expensive add-on without a clear purpose.

     It sometimes feels to me like everyone I know is buying smart-home
     electronics (myself included), but then I remember how different the
     consumer landscape in the Bay Area, New York, and Boston is from
     that of the rest of the country. Home automation will have a lot to
     prove to consumers.

   Luis Galvez:

     I agree with David on voice control, with products like Ubi or Jibo
     still being a ways away. They make sense in the home only if you’re
     close enough for the device to hear you. I’ve sometimes yelled out
     “Hey, Siri” in case my phone or iPad is nearby and listening, like
     an omnipresent being available to answer our spontaneous questions.

     A watch could be a better voice remote since it follows you
     everywhere. Alternatively, Nest could add microphones to its
     products (Dropcam already has one) and have a Google Now presence
     all over your house. While the idea of the smart home is great in
     principle, mainstream smart home adoption feels at least 10 years
     away. There are too many products people currently own that have
     another five-10 years of life left in them, and if they break in the
     interim, who’s to say the one they’re buying will come with the
     right radios or protocol — in which case, you’ll wait another 10
     years to buy the next one after that. I still don’t know the benefit
     of owning a connected washing machine. For this reason, and the fact
     that all their major product lines are tools for delivering software
     apps and media, I’m not sure Apple cares much about leading an app
     war for the smart home. The only area that would have a similar
     disruptive app store in them (in addition to the watch) is TV. But I
     don’t see us buying apps for our toaster or thermostat, or upgrading
     to the latest Toaster 6 Plus, or even a hardware app store emerging,
     like littleBits is trying to do. I don’t see much money in this
     approach. How would IFTTT monetize any of this?

     Security is a big issue as well. A few more of these incidents and
     consumers will run from the Internet of Things. I worry about Google
     being in my home now with Dropcam and the fact I am currently
     Google’s product to advertisers. Apple seems to be more cautious
     about protecting consumer trust by not storing health data or
     fingerprints in the cloud. They’ve taken the same UI of the single
     button they pioneered on the iPhone to then authenticate a
     fingerprint, and now to make a secure payment. A step further could
     be analyzing your heart rate biometrics through that same phone
     button to even further identify it’s you.

     And who is Apple kidding with the four giant sensors on the back of
     the watch only tracking pulse? Check out the one from Basis for
     comparison. Apple’s partnership with IBM to play in enterprise and
     big data could also be really interesting if they are able to
     leverage Watson’s brain and Siri’s voice to analyze business,
     health, and other data. It’s this depth of design intent that gets
     me excited about Apple’s approach. I’m fascinated by the idea of
     virtual touch and using the watch’s capacitive touchscreen pressure
     sensor to recognize on one end and the linear actuators deliver
     pressure output on the other — its the digital translation of touch
     and further blurs the hardware/software line as you practically push
     through your screen onto someone’s wrist. Reminds me of that old
     AT&T slogan.

     On Tim’s point about the Android/OEM model, The CTO of Oculus [John
     Carmack] gave a very candid keynote on the state of their product,
     including frustrations with the fragmentation of Android (point
     against the Android/OEM model) and working directly with Samsung to
     bypass “Android development hell.” Few companies will be able to
     have this approach, but it addresses a key point of the importance
     of the hardware and software being increasingly intertwined and
     optimized for each other.

       Why IoT is Doomed #4: Ecosystems
       Ecosystems? How could there be anything wrong with a
       back-to-nature,
       tree-hugging ecosystem? Well, I’m not talking about natural
       ecosystems
       here. I’m talking about their evil twin, technology ecosystems.
       Case in point: smartphone ecosystems. In this corner we have Apple
       iPhone. It has its own programming environment with its own throng
       of
       developers coding apps for the iPhone App Store that only run on
       the
       iPhone. And in that corner: Google Android, with all the same
       stuff,
       only it all requires Google under the covers.
       Both Apple and Google, of course, make billions of dollars this way
       (yes, Billion with a B, Dr. Evil!) But consumers have to choose:
       which ecosystem do
       they want to sell their soul to? Because once we consumers pick a
       side,
       it’s very difficult to cut the ties that bind us to our choice. And
       for
       all you Windows Phone or BlackBerry fans out there? Sorry Charlie,
       you
       bet on the nag that went lame in the back stretch.
       With the IoT we’re back to square one, and the Apples and Googles
       of
       the world know that the spoils will go to the winners of the
       ecosystem
       wars. Only now it’s anybody’s game again, so we have a plethora of
       vendors, both large and small, jumping into the fray and trying to
       establish a foothold, in hopes of either creating their own
       ecosystem
       (for the startups) or extending their existing one (for the
       behemoths).
       Don’t be fooled. Sure, all the IoT techies may be talking about
       open
       standards, in the hopes that all my doohickeys can seamlessly
       interoperate with all of your gewgaws. But open standards are
       nothing
       more than big sticks for beating weaker ecosystems into submission
       – and
       that turns us, the poor consumer, into collateral damage.

          + Jon Bruner
            You’re right that closed ecosystems could become a problem,
            but I think the IoT will be a harder market to consolidate
            than the smartphone market was; there are lots of producers
            involved, and I don’t expect them to line up politely to
            subject their products to other companies’ platforms.

       Where is the discussion of value for the consumer?
       Why is a connected home or device more valuable to me, the
       consumer? Sure, Apple, Google and players to be named later get to
       collect data on us, then sell it. Good for them. We are just the
       product to be sold to marketers so we can buy more stuff, I get
       that.
       As one of the cattle, what benefit is a connected washing machine,
       toaster or fridge? How often will my water heater tweet me?
       The real problem with the hype is we are talking about “things”.
       Things don’t turn over and get adopted as quickly as say a new web
       site, or something that is new and provides value. The original
       Apple iPhone was a useful thing to people, so it was adopted
       quickly.
       My toaster is also useful. I am not going to buy a new one because
       it has a display. I will buy one when mine breaks, and then I will
       consider if a smart toaster has value to me. So they won’t fly off
       the shelves.
       People don’t disrupt their lives. Nest is a success, but again the
       market for thermostats is huge, and they are a very small piece of
       that market. What are their market share numbers? I never see them,
       I guess because they are tiny.
       The assumption that us cattle will just buy IoT connected items
       because they are there is wrong. Where is the real consumer value?
       I have yet to see it.
          + Jon Bruner
            That’s my question as well; the value in something like a
            connected washing machine (to pick a trivial example) is
            overwhelmingly in its ability to wash clothes, not in its
            connectivity or software. The value in a smartphone is
            overwhelmingly in its connectivity and software.
          + http://twitter.com/hybridremote Louise
            The consumer value is:
            – savings over monthly payments to security integrators, such
            as ADT
            – unlock doors for visiting family remotely, while you are at
            work
            – see what your kids are doing
               o http://www.securitygem.com/ SecurityGem
                 Oh and egos. Inflating egos is a value too. “Hey look at
                 my $300 thermostat. Can I buy you a drink?”
     * http://www.securitygem.com/ SecurityGem
       Samsung holds the most home automation patents. Why not Samsung?
       They’ve already proven their ability and desire to play with others
       via their $200 million dollar acquisition of SmartThings.
     * Luis Galvez
       Similar to the problem of creating new standards
       (http://xkcd.com/927/) I doubt any single platform will win. Apple
       understands this and that they can’t control the vast array and
       quantity of devices being developed (some that are really cool –
       iotlist.co) which is why they’re not overtly saying they’re
       building a platform…rather they’re quietly linking platforms
       together and to its customers. It’s the smart approach that
       sidesteps all the IoT discussions and just says, “look, we have $X
       millions users on our platform – feel free to tie into it and
       easily connect your platform or device through our system, get
       access to all these users, make plenty of money, while we just help
       you connect to other platforms and control those interactions
       through one place.” This allows Logitech, or any other
       platform/product, to attach itself to Apple without being limited
       to Apple – just linked….and Apple has the perfect gateway devices
       to make the experience great for people.

       One HUGE benefit of connected washing machines etc will be simpler
       control of these devices.
       For example I managed once to get my washer to just do a spin
       without any washing. That was 6 months ago and I am baffled trying
       to do the same job today. I only remember that it took about half
       an hour reading the manual. Same with setting the oven to come on
       at a time in the evening.
     * jonbohmer
       Home automation is a side show for IoT. The real action will be in
       the commercial sector – industry, healthcare, farming and so on.
       There, it is not just a cool gadget but a money saving/making
       proposition.
     * Mark Thristan
       I am not sure we will see one platform for IoT – the balkanization
       of the internet by individual vendors but also for individual
       contexts is likely to continue. The needs and requirement space for
       an Industrial IoT, a medical IoT, a personal health IoT, a domotics
       IoT may share some common components (both architectural,
       programmatic and intended use perspective), but will likely require
       different approaches and implementations. This will be particularly
       difficult in the border between institutional use cases and
       individual use cases.
       One of the issues arising from the connectivity of the IoT is the
       move, as termed in the article, to the “Internet of Me”.
       Profoundly the shift with the smartphone revolution was not just
       convenience and mobility but the shift from a location to an
       identifiable person. Likewise, the identifiable connectivity of
       devices to an identifiable person, signals a shift from information
       about “me” to “all about me and my possessions”. This means that a
       great deal of behavioural information which was not accessible in
       unconnected devices is not just available at the level of
       “information about the device”, but is now associated indelibly
       with the individual, making it in many cases “personal data” and
       often personally identifiable data. This will be an interesting
       space for data privacy, security, and onbound decision making,
       which offers admittedly a great deal of opportunity, but perhaps a
       level of underassessed threat.
     * HelloIamPatBurns
       1. Apple may not own the future of the IoT but their impact on
       standards for the IoT was foreshadowed by the impact they are
       having with NFC. Six month ago the talk was “NFC is dead”, etc. and
       suddenly it is the hottest wireless technology in the world today.
       2. NFC is now the most important IoT technology in the world. The
       chance of another wireless radio specifically intended for the IoT
       making it into a smartphone in the next five years is extremely
       low. Perhaps longer. More discussion on how NFC is being massively
       undervalued for the IoT here: ht.ly/BSxMN

       are myriad. Commercial, industrial, government, military, P2P apps
       outside the home, etc.
