Earthquake App Underscores Vulnerable Housing in Oakland, Calif.

A new mobile and Web app, called SoftStory, maps and highlights seismically
vulnerable housing.

   It’s been said the greatest dangers are the ones unseen. The maxim
   plays out aptly for Oakland, Calif., a city that recently rocked the
   news for its hundreds of residential buildings — and thousands of
   individual units inside them — prone to potential collapse in an
   earthquake.

   The threat pinches a nerve for software developer Dave Guarino. For
   months Guarino has labored, half investigating and half collaborating,
   to develop an app that locates seismically vulnerable buildings. The
   new Web and mobile tool offers residents a quick way to check if their
   home could be vulnerable and lists each property’s current city
   evaluation status. Built within OpenOakland, a volunteer civic
   technology group, the app has mapped and color-coded high risk
   buildings based on data from the city and analysis by the Association
   of Bay Area Governments in 2013.

   The app's name, SoftStory, stems from the term used to label
   susceptible structures built on slopes or squatting atop hollow
   infrastructure like apartments over empty parking garages. Guarino was
   compelled to coordinate development of the app partly from his
   association with OpenOakland but mostly from pressures close to home.

   "I read about these problems that stem from seismic vulnerability, and
   then I realized, I was probably living in one of these buildings," he
   said.

   The gravity struck Guarino deeply after he sifted through the
   information — building data that took roughly two months to gather from
   Oakland officials. What his analysis indicated was a glaring inequality
   between safe and unsafe homes in Oakland. Less affluent residents,
   those living in older multi-unit buildings, which comprise much of the
   city’s affordable housing, would be largely displaced in a large quake.

   “In a major earthquake, if a lot of these buildings are not retrofitted
   and fall down, you're going to have a really significant displacement
   and it will disproportionately affect folks who are lower income,”
   Guarino said.

   Worse, he added that based on current development trends and research,
   the displacement would likely be long term for many of Oakland’s less
   fortunate. Homes that had crumbled would not likely be rebuilt as
   affordable housing but return at market price with rents to match.

   “Basically, that means a permanent displacement of a lot of people,” he
   said.

   Putting his skills to work, Guarino and OpenOakland teamed up with
   Michal Migurski, CTO for the group’s parent organization at Code for
   America. Following the magnitude 6.0 quake that rattled California’s
   Napa Valley, Migurski volunteered to move the app along if only to
   engage the public on a critical issue.

   "Mike said, ‘Hey, you've been working on this earthquake project, why
   don't we just sprint and get a quick version out,’” Guarino said.

   And so, minus bells and whistles, Guarino and his team went to work
   coding data sets and mapping parcel information with a soft launch at
   the end of August. The idea is to draw attention and dialogue to the
   issue while calling on property owners to retrofit properties for
   themselves and residents.

   Despite the endeavor, Guarino is realistic in his expectations. The
   issue is difficult and solutions hard. For one, retrofitting multi-unit
   buildings can generate contractor bills in the thousands for each unit.
   As example — and not as an average — he explained that if each unit had
   a retrofit cost of $15,000 this translates into a $75,000 cost for a
   common five-unit building. The price has to be shouldered by either
   building owners or unit residents, both of whom, might not be able to
   pay.

   Second, the other challenge is held up in inspections: Structural
   engineers are required to definitively label a structure as a soft
   story building. Currently, a large majority of the potential soft story
   buildings mapped in the app have yet to finish a full inspection. There
   is also no law mandating property owners to retrofit buildings to
   modern standards — though city officials have said they expect an
   ordinance to come before year’s end.

   As residents in potential soft story housing wait, Guarino said the
   best alternative is to invest in earthquake insurance that would help
   pay for lost property and provide temporary housing. Beyond this,
   public dialogue and calls for action are what he sees as the next best
   steps.

   “This is a really complex issue — and I can't emphasize that enough,”
   Guarino said.
