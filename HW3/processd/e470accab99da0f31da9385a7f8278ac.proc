   Alasdair Davies

   Alasdair Davies is a Technical Advisor for the Zoological Society of
   London’s Conservation Technology program and a web developer for the
   EDGE of Existence program. His current focus is the delivery
   of ZSL’s Instant Wild project, the advancement of camera trapping
   technology, and the future development of the EDGE website. Alasdair is
   also a founder and director of the primate conservation organization
   The Great Primate Handshake. We conducted this interview via email.

   When and where was the idea for Instant Wild hatched?
   ZSL’s Instant Wild programme started life on a staircase within
   Conservation Programmes at Regent’s Park, London—better known as the
   location of ZSL London Zoo. It was one of those “Have you seen the new
   GSM-enabled camera traps? Aren’t they great…” conversations whilst
   holding the morning’s first mug of coffee and checking in on the day’s
   schedule.

   Is there a story behind it?
   Instant Wild logo Instant Wild logo Although the conversation on the
   staircase was brief, our Director of Conservation Programmes, Jonathan
   Baillie, was luckily the other person on the stairs that morning. Later
   that afternoon, he called me into his office. It was evident that he
   had been pondering the morning’s conversation and I could sense that
   there was an exciting idea on the table. Within in an hour, the name
   Instant Wild was decided upon and the concept of sending the very
   photos the cameras take to the general public for instant analysis was
   founded. We’d have hundreds of thousands of eyes scanning thousands of
   photos from across the globe every single day. It could answer so many
   questions, and there wasn’t a second to lose.

   Where were the first cameras installed, and what kinds of lessons did
   you learn right away?
   We’d start with just one or two cameras. That was the plan. We’d need a
   website, and of cause, an app, so we hired the services of James
   Sanford, an iPhone app developer, and drafted how it could work
   technically. We just needed to figure out how the general public were
   going to help us identify the animals captured in each photo and where
   our first location would be.

   It took about 6 months to get the basics together, and in November
   2011, Instant Wild was launched with a handful of cameras in Kenya, Sri
   Lanka, and the United Kingdom. We asked friends, volunteers, and
   colleagues in-country to buy a few local SIM cards, set the cameras up
   to email the photos through to our server, and then we’d push them out
   to the app and website in real time. It would take less than 60 seconds
   to display a photo from the wild.

   What technologies are currently used for data collection, transmission,
   storage, and analysis? (hardware, software, etc.)
   We currently use GSM-enabled camera traps, but have recently developed
   satellite-enabled camera traps, as we are of course always limited by
   the GSM coverage, especially in remote or difficult-to-reach locations.
   The cameras detect the movement of wildlife by the use of PIR sensors
   (passive infrared). Essentially, they are able to detect tiny changes
   in the ambient temperature (i.e., when a warm-blooded animal walks
   past), and it is this that triggers the photo to be taken.

   What’s the process by which an image is captured, transmitted,
   identified, stored, and put to use in research?
   Diagram A details how we deliver images today. Diagram B details our
   future system in development at the moment, to be released in 2014.

   Who maintains the cameras in the remote locations?
   At present the cameras are maintained by volunteers or field
   conservationists. We are incredibly grateful to everyone who has helped
   thus far, as well as those who continue to help maintain our cameras by
   replacing batteries and configuring them for transmission at each new
   location.

   Are there interesting and/or difficult challenges involved in keeping
   the cameras working?
   The biggest issue we face is poor or unreliable GSM coverage. The
   cameras need to transmit data and so require a GPRS connection as a
   minimum, but fare much better if EDGE or higher is available. We
   sometimes only acquire 25%  of the actual images taken by a camera in a
   given day, as the signal can sometimes fluctuate. The second major
   issue is resilience to environmental conditions. Moisture can erode
   battery containers and ants often decide that the camera’s internal
   electronics are a good place to make a nest and call it home.

   There are fewer than 200 Javan leopards in the wild.

   Of the million+ animal identifications thus far, how many extremely
   rare animals have been spotted?
   Our two most important achievements have been the sighting of a
   critically endangered Javan Leopard on our Indonesian camera, proving
   its existence in the area and the discovery of a Mountain mouse-deer on
   the Sri Lankan cameras. Found in the highlands, it was believed to have
   only been photographed once in the wild three years ago until it was
   spotted by members of the public on Instant Wild.

   What happens with the identification information? Who uses that data,
   and to what end? Is the data made publicly available?
   Instant Wild supports ZSL’s conservation work in several ways. First of
   all it engages members of the public in conservation research and
   improves awareness and knowledge of the species identified. Secondly,
   by passing the identification of camera trap images to the general
   public, conservationists can analyse the data quicker, which helps us
   make informed conservation decisions. In our last analysis of user
   identifications, we recorded a success rate of over 90%. Thirdly,
   Instant Wild provides ZSL with the ability to quickly know if a rare
   and threatened species has been spotted, and helps us to build up a
   picture of species type and density in a particular area.

   In 2013, ZSL was awarded a $750,000 Google Global Impact Award to fund
   next-generation camera traps equipped with automated sensors to better
   protect threatened wildlife. What new technologies will you be bringing
   online as a result of the Google grant? Will ZSL be building the new
   cameras/mics? Can the (tech-savvy) public help in any way?
   We’re building a system that utilises a number of evolving
   technologies. It’s a system that will combine a number of new
   low-powered sensors in the form of cameras, but also seismic and
   audio-based sensors to sense the presence of wildlife or human
   encroachment (vehicle entry, gunshots, etc…).

   By using low-powered Atmel processors and RF, we will transmit the
   information the sensors capture to our satellite-enabled “nodes” up to
   500m away. We will then be able to analyse the sensor data received
   prior to transmission over the Iridium satellite link by filtering
   photos through visual recognition software, or matching sound clips
   against audio signatures using a Raspberry Pi at the heart of each
   node. We’re always open to suggestions from the tech community as to
   how we can improve our system, whether it’s by exploring new power
   supply methods or just improvements to our app.

   What makes the new technologies better than the equipment and software
   you’re currently using?
   From a software perspective, visual recognition algorithms are
   constantly evolving and we intend to maximise their potential to help
   us optimize our system. If we can correctly identify the presence of a
   human in a photo 100% of the time, for example, then we can guarantee
   that the system is able to alert rangers and law enforcers even before
   human eyes scan each photo.

   From a hardware perspective, one of the exciting developments is the
   backwards compatibility of the Iridium modems in our satellite nodes to
   send 10 x the amount of physical data when Iridium launches the Iridium
   NEXT satellite constellation in 2016. We’ll then be able to send higher
   resolution photos, audio, and even video.

   Will you be launching an Android IW app?
   You bet.

       The missing question: “After the system is operational — and
       quickly hacked by poachers for location targeting — how long will
       it be until they kill the very last wild member of every species
       being monitored?”

       @Nexcerpt:disqus – A very good point. Poachers will certainly start
       to develop their own systems and may already be using GSM camera
       traps that are readily available off the shelf. Organized poaching
       gangs are equipped with night vision goggles and are even using
       veterinary branded helicopters to disguise their activities. Our
       solution is to deploy technologies that rangers on the ground can
       use to prevent poachers from actually entering protected areas and
       deploying their own.
       However, the best security available (anti-tamper / encrypted
       transmission / advanced camouflage) is always of concern to us and
       will be integrated into our systems at each stage.
