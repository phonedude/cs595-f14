   The Presidential Innovation Fellows program brings the principles,
   values, and practices of the innovation economy into government through
   the most effective agents of change we know: our people. This highly
   competitive program pairs talented, diverse individuals from the
   innovation community with top civil servants to tackle many of our
   Nationâ€™s biggest challenges, and to achieve a profound and lasting
   social impact. These teams of government experts and private-sector
   doers are using approaches like design thinking and lean startup to
   achieve results for the American people in months, not years.
