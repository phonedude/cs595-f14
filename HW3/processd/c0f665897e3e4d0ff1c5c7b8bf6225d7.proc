Current Catalog Programs:

   DARPA Program Office Description
   AA I2O The Active Authentication (AA) program seeks to develop novel
   ways of validating the identity of computer users by focusing on the
   unique aspects of individuals through software-based biometrics.
   Biometrics are defined as the characteristics used to recognize
   individuals based on one or more intrinsic physical or behavioral
   traits. This program is focused on behavioral biometrics.
   ADAMS
   UPDATED
   I2O The Anomaly Detection at Multiple Scales (ADAMS) program seeks to
   create, adapt and apply technology to anomaly characterization and
   detection in massive data sets. Anomalies in data cue the collection of
   additional, actionable information in a wide variety of real world
   contexts.
   APAC I2O The Automated Program Analysis for Cybersecurity (APAC)
   program aims to address the challenge of timely and robust security
   validation of mobile apps by first defining security properties to be
   measured against and then developing automated tools to perform the
   measuring. APAC draws heavily from the field of formal-methods program
   analysis (theorem proving, logic and machine proofing) to keep
   malicious code out of DoD Android-based application marketplaces. APAC
   seeks to apply recent research breakthroughs in this field in an
   attempt to scale DoD's program analysis capability to a level never
   before achieved with an automated solution.
   BET I2O The objective of the Binary Executable Transforms (BET) program
   is to produce revolutionary technologies for analyzing executable
   binaries to identify and extract executable components. Executable
   components are defined as a fully encapsulated set of subroutines, data
   structures, objects and global variables that accomplish a particular
   function, along with metadata documenting the component's arguments and
   any system libraries used. Specifically, BET performers are conducting
   innovative research in: • Automatically analyzing binaries and
   identifying functional components. • Automatically slicing and
   extracting identified functionality into reusable components with
   well-defined inputs and outputs. • Combining static and dynamic binary
   analysis to improve understanding of binary executables. • Exploring
   formal verification methods to prove functional component properties. •
   Developing intermediate representation language to support program
   slicing. • Developing technologies to enable exploration and research
   for the BET program.
   BOLT
   UPDATED
   I2O The Broad Operational Language Translation (BOLT) program is aimed
   at enabling communication with non-English-speaking populations and
   identifying important information in foreign-language sources by: 1)
   allowing English-speakers to understand foreign-language sources of all
   genres, including chat, messaging and informal conversation; 2)
   providing English-speakers the ability to quickly identify targeted
   information in foreign-language sources using natural-language queries;
   and 3) enabling multi-turn communication in text and speech with
   non-English speakers. If successful, BOLT would deliver all
   capabilities free from domain or genre limitations.
   CFT
   UPDATED
   I2O The Cyber Fast Track (CFT) program sought revolutionary advances in
   cyber science, devices, and systems through low-cost, quick-turnaround
   projects. To achieve this, CFT engaged a novel performer base many of
   whom were new to government contracting. From August 2011 to April 2013
   the program attracted 550 proposal submissions, of which 90 percent
   were from performers that had never previously worked with the
   government, and awarded 135 contracts.
   CRASH I2O The Clean-Slate Design of Resilient, Adaptive, Secure Hosts
   (CRASH) program is focused on the design of new computer systems that
   are highly resistant to cyberattack, can adapt after a successful
   attack to continue rendering useful services, learn from previous
   attacks how to guard against and cope with future attacks, and can
   repair themselves after attacks have succeeded. This program addresses
   computer architectures from processors and instruction sets, includes
   operating systems and programming languages, and extends up to
   application level tools.
   CSFV I2O Crowd Sourced Formal Verification (CSFV) is a DARPA program
   that aims to investigate whether large numbers of non-experts can
   perform formal verification faster and more cost-effectively than
   conventional processes. The goal is to transform verification into a
   more accessible task by creating fun, intuitive games that reflect
   formal verification problems. Playing the games would effectively help
   software verification tools complete corresponding formal verification
   proofs.
   Cyber Defense (CyberGenome) I2O The Cyber Defense Program is developing
   the core computing and networking technologies required to protect
   DoD's information, information infrastructure, and mission-critical
   information systems. This includes new cyber-forensic techniques to
   automate the discovery, identification, and characterization of malware
   variants and thereby accelerate the development of effective responses.
   DCAPS
   UPDATED
   I2O The Detection and Computational Analysis of Psychological Signals
   (DCAPS) program aims to develop novel analytical tools to assess
   psychological status of warfighters in the hopes of improving
   psychological health awareness and enabling them to seek timely help.
   DCAPS tools will be developed to analyze patterns in everyday behaviors
   to detect subtle changes associated with post-traumatic stress
   disorder, depression and suicidal ideation. In particular, DCAPS hopes
   to advance the state-of-the-art in extraction and analysis of 'honest
   signals' from a wide variety of sensory data inherent in daily social
   interactions. DCAPS is not aimed at providing an exact diagnosis, but
   at providing a general metric of psychological health.
   DEFT I2O Automated, deep natural-language processing (NLP) technology
   may hold a solution for more efficiently processing text information
   and enabling understanding connections in text that might not be
   readily apparent to humans. DARPA created the Deep Exploration and
   Filtering of Text (DEFT) program to harness the power of NLP.
   Sophisticated artificial intelligence of this nature has the potential
   to enable defense analysts to efficiently investigate orders of
   magnitude more documents, which would enable discovery of implicitly
   expressed, actionable information within those documents.
   ENGAGE I2O DARPA created the ENGAGE program to enable the development
   of education and training systems that are better, faster, continuously
   optimized, and massively scalable. ENGAGE is exploring software- and
   data-intensive education and training methods that harness the power of
   large user populations to optimize instruction.
   FLASHLIGHT I2O The FLASHLIGHT program seeks to prevent data
   exfiltration and information leakage through the use of a hardened
   audit and inspection capability that attests to the integrity and
   legitimacy of data leaving a network enclave.
   GRAPHS
   UPDATED
   DSO GRAPHS is developing scalable algorithms and statistical methods
   for the analysis and modelling of very large and dynamically evolving
   networks, with the intent of developing predictive methods for
   anomalous and exceptional events in networks. A major focus of the
   program has been quantitative and structural aspects of large networks
   and the attending models. The program is divided into a few thrusts,
   with performers working in sampling techniques for graphs, geometric
   embeddings into hyperbolic spaces, Gaussian Conditional Random Fields,
   meso-level network behaviors, and link prediction.
   HACMS I2O The High-Assurance Cyber Military Systems (HACMS) program
   goal is to create technology for the construction of high-assurance
   cyber-physical systems, where high assurance is defined to mean
   functionally correct and satisfying appropriate safety and security
   properties. Key technologies include interactive software synthesis
   systems, verification tools, and specification languages.
   MRC I2O The Mission-oriented Resilient Clouds (MRC) program is
   addressing some of the security challenges facing cloud computing by
   developing technologies to detect, diagnose and respond to attacks in
   the cloud, with the goal of effectively building a 'community health
   system' for the cloud. MRC is also developing technologies intended to
   enable missions that are supported by cloud computing and other
   networked systems to continue functioning while under cyberattack.
   PPAML
   UPDATED
   I2O Machine learning - the ability of computers to understand data,
   manage results and infer insights from uncertain information - is the
   force behind many recent revolutions in computing. Email spam filters,
   smartphone personal assistants and self-driving vehicles are all based
   on research advances in machine learning. Unfortunately, even as the
   demand for these capabilities is accelerating, every new application
   requires a Herculean effort. Teams of hard-to-find experts must build
   expensive, custom tools that are often painfully slow and can perform
   unpredictably against large, complex data sets.
   The Probabilistic Programming for Advancing Machine Learning (PPAML)
   program aims to address these challenges. Probabilistic programming is
   a new programming paradigm for managing uncertain information. Using
   probabilistic programming languages, PPAML seeks to greatly increase
   the number of people who can successfully build machine learning
   applications and make machine learning experts radically more
   effective. Moreover, the program seeks to create more economical,
   robust and powerful applications that need less data to produce more
   accurate results - features inconceivable with today's technology.
   PROCEED I2O DARPA's Programming Computation on Encrypted Data (PROCEED)
   program is a research effort that seeks to develop methods that allow
   computing with encrypted data without first decrypting that data,
   making it possible to compute more securely in untrusted environments.
   RATS
   UPDATED
   I2O The Robust Automatic Transcription of Speech (RATS) program will
   create algorithms and software for performing the following tasks on
   potentially speech-containing signals received over communication
   channels that are extremely noisy and/or highly distorted: speech
   activity detection, language identification, speaker identification,
   and key word spotting.
   Revolutionizing Prosthetics
   UPDATED
   BTO DARPA launched the Revolutionizing Prosthetics program with a
   radical goal: Create an advanced electromechanical prosthetic upper
   limb with near-natural control that enhances independence and improves
   quality of life for amputees, and gain U.S. Food and Drug
   Administration (FDA) approval for its use. In May 2014, less than eight
   years after the effort was launched, that dream is a reality; the FDA
   approved the DEKA Arm System.
   SAFER I2O The SAFER program seeks to develop technology to enable safe,
   resilient communications over the Internet, particularly in situations
   in which third parties attempt to discover the identity or location of
   the end users, or block communications. The program also seeks to
   provide the technological quality of service required to support
   applications such as electronic mail, instant messaging, voice over IP,
   and other media that promote effective communication.
   SMISC
   UPDATED
   I2O The general goal of the Social Media in Strategic Communication
   (SMISC) program is to develop a new science of social networks built on
   an emerging technology base. Through the program, DARPA seeks to
   develop tools to support the efforts of human operators to counter
   misinformation or deception campaigns with truthful information.
   XDATA
   UPDATED
   I2O XDATA is developing an open source software library for big data to
   help overcome the challenges of effectively scaling to modern data
   volume and characteristics. The program is developing the tools and
   techniques to process and analyze large sets of imperfect, incomplete
   data. Its programs and publications focus on the areas of analytics,
   visualization, and infrastructure to efficiently fuse, analyze and
   disseminate these large volumes of data.
