   2014 Open Hardware Summit

   September 30 + October 1 2014 in Rome, Italy

Annual Open Hardware Ada Fellowship – Call is Open!!

   by Addie Wagenknecht on August 7, 2014

   The Open Hardware Summit will take place on September 30th and October
   1, 2014 in Rome as part of their Innovation Week. This is the first
   time the summit will take place outside of the US.

   For the second year in the row, the Summit team is excited to offer up
   to five Open Hardware Fellowships which include a $1000 travel stipend
   and an evening out with select speakers and chairs of the Open Hardware
   Summit for woman and/or significantly female-identified members of the
   open source community.

   The application can be filled out here. The Deadline to Apply is August
   14th by 12pm EST, notifications will be sent out by August 18th.

   The Ada Initiative, an organization supporting women in open tech and
   culture, will assist us with the selection process. By offering travel
   assistance again this year, the Open Source Hardware Association hopes
   we as a community can encourage more women to participate in future
   years of the Open Hardware Summit. We have many strong women leaders
   and speakers in our field and we personally want to continue the trend
   upward.


   This is a crucial time in open source where we have the opportunity to
   shape the future of the whole field together.  We invite you to contact
   us about sponsoring the scholarships. We are just on the edge of what
   is possible, Let’s do this!

   See you in Rome,

   Addie Wagenknecht / @wheresaddie + Alicia Gibb / @pipx and all the
   women of the open hardware association / @ohsummit
