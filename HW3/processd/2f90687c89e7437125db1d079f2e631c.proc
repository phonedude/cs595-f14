Civic Tech and Engagement: How SeeClickFix is Changing the Fabric of Local
Reality

   BY Micah L. Sifry | Thursday, July 24 2014

   To see how people using the Internet can thicken civic engagement in
   deep and positive ways, there is no better example than
   SeeClickFix.com, a community platform that was founded in 2008 by Ben
   Berkowitz, a computer programmer living in New Haven, Connecticut, and
   his friends Miles and Kam Lasater and Jeff Blasius.

   They started the site after Berkowitz, who was then 28 years old, tried
   to report some unsightly graffiti on a neighbor’s building. After
   calling the New Haven city government, nothing happened. “I got the
   idea that my neighbors were reporting similar things, but there was no
   accountability and no collaborative discussion," he recalled later. So
   he and Kam Lasater hit upon the idea of creating a website where anyone
   could post a problem needing fixing on a public map, and then the site
   would email the report to the addresses of top city officials. They
   reasoned that making the reports transparent would make it harder for
   city hall to ignore them, and easier for community members to rally
   around the most urgent issues.

   At the time, Robert Smuts was New Haven’s chief administrator, in
   effect, second-in-command to the mayor. He told me that the city had
   launched a similar input channel on its own website, but it didn’t get
   much use. “Instead, we started getting flooded by these emails from
   SeeClickFix,” he recalled with a chuckle. “The service we had gone with
   was designed by government. SeeClickFix was more user-driven, more
   driven by the resident public.” He admits that there was “some
   grousing” inside city government about all those complaining emails,
   but as he put it, “SeeClickFix didn’t create the pothole, it just made
   it easier for people to report it.” In response, he started integrating
   SeeClickFix’s reports into the city’s internal management system.

   Flash forward six years, and SeeClickFix has become, in Smuts’ words,
   “the universal front end for the city of New Haven, for non-emergency
   reporting.” Indeed, not only is a link to SeeClickFix featured
   prominently on the top right corner of the city’s official website, a
   widget from SeeClickFix showing the daily flow of fresh reports from
   residents is also posted on the online front pages of the city’s two
   main newspapers, the Register and the Independent. In New Haven, Smuts
   says, about ten thousand reports flow through the system each year,
   half from public SeeClickFix users, and half from city employees taking
   a report from a member of the public by phone and inputting it directly
   into the SeeClickFix site from their desk. The city pays SeeClickFix
   for access to an internal dashboard that helps it to manage the flow.

   About 170 cities across America have similar relationships with
   SeeClickFix, including Albany (NY), Albuquerque, Atlantic City,
   Chicago, Houston, Minneapolis, Oakland, Raleigh, Washington, DC, and
   Winston-Salem. The states of Massachusetts and Utah are also customers.
   Berkowitz says about 350,000 registered users have signed up, and more
   than 670,000 issues have been reported and resolved across all of those
   sites. The one-millionth issue report came in this past March,
   highlighting a pothole on a street in Chicago. More than 1.2 million
   comments were added by users to service requests in just 2013 alone.
   The company, which is a privately-held for-profit that makes money by
   charging cities for its service, is growing steadily.

   Designing for Engagement
   In New Haven, as of the end of 2013, 17,000 people had SeeClickFix
   accounts, an impressive twelve percent of the city’s population. It has
   taken Berkowitz and his colleagues six years to reach that level of
   usage. Along the way, they have made a variety of important design
   decisions aimed at maximizing SeeClickFix’s potential to become a
   central community hub for problem solving. For example, when a problem
   report is marked resolved, which the responsible city agency
   representative usually does, any resident can re-open the issue.

   [Screen shot 2014-07-23 at 10.28.28 PM.png]

   “What’s most important is not that city hall thinks something is
   solved, but the citizen has to be happy,” Berkowitz told me. That’s a
   design decision that, politically, situates ultimate power in the hands
   of the users, not the clients, of SeeClickFix. They’ve also added a
   “Say Thanks” button that encourages users to acknowledge when a problem
   is resolved; each Friday the site then sends the person who was
   responsible for fixing that problem an email with the names of all the
   people who thanked them. More than 7,500 such thank-you messages were
   sent in 2013 across all the users of the platform. And if someone
   chooses to follow a specific problem or location, the software
   automatically will alert them to “points of interest” within a
   five-block radius of that issue.

   Users can earn “civic points” for a variety of actions such as
   commenting on an issue (5 points) reporting an issue (10 points),
   getting an issue you reported closed and archived (30 points), getting
   at least one user to comment, vote, or follow your issue (50 points),
   creating a watch area (50 points), and logging in seven days in a row
   (100 points). The more points you get, the more impressive your title.
   Users with 250-500 are listed as “civic crusaders”; those with
   1000-2000 are “digital superheros”; and those with more than 10,000 get
   the “Jane Jacobs” label in honor of the famous urbanist. And as people
   learn the ins-and-outs of getting things fixed in their town, they can
   contribute to a do-it-yourself “frequently asked questions” wiki that
   is designed to help everyone, include city staffers, know the right
   answer to those questions.

   If, as software guru Mitch Kapor once wrote, architecture is politics,
   then Berkowitz and his colleagues have designed SeeClickFix to maximize
   visible connections and activity between neighbors. The result is
   “thick” civic engagement between ordinary residents, elected
   representatives, and city officials that merges the online and offline
   worlds and, in the best of cases, is helping cities like New Haven do
   something more important than just save money or respond more quickly
   to residents’ complaints: it is growing social capital.

   Berkowitz jokingly calls potholes “the gateway drug to civic
   engagement” and says he looks forward to spring, because it’s the time
   of year when the warming weather reveals all the streets in need of
   repair after winter in the Northeast. “This is my favorite time of
   year,” he wrote on his blog in March of 2013. “It separates accountable
   from unaccountable governments in a tight time frame with simple
   anecdotal evidence that government is working or not.  More importantly
   late winter is a time where citizens are engaging passionately about
   block level concerns. This also presents a great opportunity for those
   looking to engage with citizens on a deeper level than potholes.”  He
   added:
    

     At SeeClickFix we like to capture frustrated citizens, harness that
     frustration and point it towards engagement with feedback loops
     created by neighbors and governments. This Spring will bring lots of
     new users who come to the platform to vent. In the following months
     they will likely engage with other content that helps build a better
     more citizen driven neighborhood, help a neighbor find a lost pet or
     actually resolve an issue with their own hands. We've been
     optimizing this algorithm for neighborhood engagement for the past 5
     years and every year it gets more interesting as the outliers on the
     platform become more common place and repeated across communities.
     Bring on the potholes, good governance and great citizenship.

   "It's Always Interesting to See the Public Organize Itself Around
   Issues"
   Here’s an in-depth look at SeeClickFix in action. On August 29th 2013,
   a dog was abandoned behind a building on Audobon Street in downtown New
   Haven, Connecticut. Part pit bull and part boxer, it was tied up and in
   distress. Someone going by the user-name MableX (then with 880 civic
   points, now it's 1370) took a picture with their mobile phone and
   posted a brief report on New Haven's SeeClickFix page. “Animal Control
   does not answer the phone and the police said to call animal Control,”
   MableX wrote. “Mailbox of Animal Control officer filled so I called my
   Alderman to see if he could help. Went looking for police officer on
   Whitney, none to be found.”

   [Screen shot 2014-07-23 at 10.32.35 PM.png]

   Within minutes, another SeeClickFix user, Robbin (with 195 civic
   points), responded, “I am available if someone needs to come stay with
   the dog until animal control responds...I live on Chapel St. and can be
   there quickly.”

   Soon after that, the city alderman for that district, Doug Hausladen
   (with 26,925 civic points), chimed in on the thread: “Robbin - please
   do! He needs some water - I got the call from the constituent but i'm
   tied up at work. I also forwarded to animal control and left messages
   (as did the constituent). keep me posted if anything changes,” he
   added, posting his cell phone number.

   Robbin replied, “On my way…with water & I’ll grab some dog biscuits.”

   Then a police officer named Sgt. Means, using a guest account, posted:
   “Spoke to the supervisor at animal control. Complaint received.”

   Meanwhile, MableX was still paying attention to the conversation, even
   though she couldn’t stay with the dog. “Thank you for looking into the
   safety of this dog. Someone from ACES got him/her a blanket and bowl of
   water. Found out dog belongs to a homeless man. Hope this is not a ‘Mr.
   Bojangles’ scenario.”

   Robbin soon popped up again. “I am with dog...female...i brought
   food...she was hungry...very tame dog but definitely happy for
   attention, food & water...will wait for animal control...”

   And then, about an hour from her first report, MableX marked the issue
   closed. “Animal Control Officer came and retrieved dog. Thanks to ACES
   and Robbin of Chapel Street for tending dog,” she wrote. Then follows
   some idle repartee amongst several users on whether this episode
   mirrored the dog in the song “Mr. Bojangles,” interspersed by about 15
   other people chiming in to simply say, “Thanks for fixing this issue.”

   That wasn’t the end of the story, however. A little more than a week
   later, a guest user of SeeClickFix named Christina reported seeing the
   same dog again tied up and abandoned. And three days after that,
   another guest user questioned whether getting the dog to Animal Control
   was such a good idea, writing “do you honestly think any time in that
   cold, blanketless, heartless, shelter will be anything but torturous?”
   Someone else agreed, and marked the case “reopened.”

   That was followed by posts from several guest users, all speculating
   about conditions in the animal shelter. None of them were happy about
   the dog’s prospects. And then, amazingly, Officer Stephani Johnson, New
   Haven’s Municipal Animal Control Officer, chimed in with a lengthy
   guest post setting the record straight.

   “If you would like to visit OUR shelter you will see that 95 percent of
   our adoptable animals are Pitbulls or Pit part mixes awaiting new
   homes, not being euthanized as they walk in the door just because of
   their breed,” she told the doubters. Further defending her agency’s
   work, she wrote:

     Are we understaffed, YES, but we work hard caring for our
     animals,feeding, cleaning, triage and daily care of sick animals as
     well as assisting the public with complaints, introducing animals to
     potential adopters, school tours, food assistance and referrals for
     rehoming pets, just to name a few. We do not have a receptionist so
     we must answer the phone and return all calls when time allows. We
     do not close for lunch as similar agencies do and our breaks are
     when we can get them. We make every attempt to address everyone's
     complaint, issue or concern.

   Then she asked for help placing animals for adoption and donations of
   food and supplies. You can walk in my shoes for a day, she told the
   shelter’s uninformed critics, listing specific opportunities for
   volunteering.

   And then she closed out her post with the facts about the dog that
   started the whole thread:

     Now here's the update.......Five-Year-Old "Lady", who is in great
     shape, was reclaimed by her owner the following day. He gave a
     physical address but we believe he is homeless. "Lady" was picked up
     again a week later when she was found tied behind another location.
     He sent a friend in to confirm she was at the shelter and asked that
     we find her a home. She is a happy dog and it is quite evident that
     her owner loved her as she shows it in her temperament. She will
     soon be placed for adoption and maybe DC [the original critic who
     questioned the shelter’s work] can recommend a new family for
     her. Thank you all for being patient, caring and assisting.

   After that, two more guest users left comments. One said, “We all
   appreciate the work that people like you do for the four footed
   citizens of this country. I suggest that those who are most critical of
   shelters get involved in one locally and offer their time to help
   alleviate the burden of the workers or contribute in other ways. Just
   complaining is not helping.” And the second one railed against the
   divisive tone that the skeptics brought to the conversation, saying,
   “Let’s try to work together on an issue we clearly all care about
   rather than against one another.”

   To end things, MableX—the original passerby who started the thread by
   reporting the abandoned dog—closes the report again, and begs everyone
   to have more of a “wee bit of humor” about life in New Haven. And then,
   some icing on the cake: another guest user also thanks Johnson for her
   comments, adding, “I am about to take my first step toward volunteering
   at a shelter. Baby steps for me, a little at a time…Thank you for
   sharing, Stephanie. It paints a much better picture in my mind of what
   to expect.”

   Stop and consider what took place on this single thread (which has been
   viewed more than 2,000 times, by the way). First, a concerned passerby
   spotted and reported a public problem. A neighbor heard about it and
   decided to take action. The elected representative for that local
   district also responded, nudging the responsible agencies in city
   government while also supporting the citizen taking action. A local cop
   reported that help is on the way. The representative and the Good
   Samaritan both kept everyone informed on the situation, and then the
   original passerby, still monitoring the news from afar, declared the
   problem solved. All of this happened in real-time on a website that
   anyone could use.

   Then, a concerned but skeptical resident asked for accountability,
   fearing that the service provided by the city was sub-par. Other
   residents, citing rumors, fueled that worry. And then, the responsible
   city official responded with chapter and verse on what she says
   actually happened, using her real name and giving plenty of checkable
   facts. Two residents offered her support, and the issue got closed
   again, transparently. And then the open discussion had the effect of
   inspiring at least one new person to volunteer her time to civic
   improvement.

   Before SeeClickFix existed, this scenario would likely have unfolded
   this way: Someone would have called 911 or Animal Control to get the
   dog. The dog would probably have waited alone until their arrival. The
   alderman would probably have called the police for help, but then he
   would likely have moved on to other business. And would anyone have
   felt any sense of urgency? Maybe yes, maybe no. The shelter would have
   taken the dog in, but would its staff have felt scrutinized for how
   they cared for it? Maybe yes, maybe no. Would any of the local
   residents have seen each other getting involved, or known of the
   responsiveness of their city agencies and representatives? Most likely
   not. And finally, would there have been an easily accessible record of
   the entire encounter, including contact information for various
   involved parties or the number of times they had been civically active?
   Absolutely not.

   “There's a lot of dialogue between city staff and members of the
   public,” says New Haven chief administrator Robert Smuts. “A lot of it
   starts off snippy and exasperated,” he notes. “There are always trolls
   out there, but it pretty quickly evolves into an appreciation of the
   work being done and the effort being made.” He adds, “It's also
   interesting to see the public organize itself around issues--either to
   get the city to address something, or to address it themselves.”

   Paul Wessel, a former city director of traffic and parking, another
   longtime community organizer, says, “It’s an integrator, a connector.
   It functions, in some ways, like a faster, better,
   letters-to-the-editor page, but one that has the ability to connect to
   a work order system.”

   “We all have heard the stories of entire neighborhoods that sat idly by
   while a person screamed for help,” Ben Berkowitz reflected later on his
   blog, ruminating on this one abandoned dog incident. “It is awesome to
   know that the community that I get to work with every day is not that
   community.”

   Robbin, the woman who went to help the dog, whose full name is Robbin
   Siepold, told me by email that she had heard about its situation from a
   SeeClickFix email alert. The site lets users subscribe to alerts for
   specific areas, and she used to work for a company in that part of
   downtown. She explained what happened next:

     Having been laid off from that company, I was home that day -- I
     live downtown on Chapel Street across from The Green, and hence my
     ability to jump into action quickly. I have a passion to help
     animals in need, so there was no hesitation on my part to help out.
     I applaud those that first discovered the dog and took action — and
     I have to give a plug to our Alderperson Doug Hausladen, who stepped
     in to help as well! While waiting for the dog warden to arrive,
     tenants of the adjacent condos and staff of the adjacent music
     school came out and that became a nice neighborly conversation as
     well – discussing the dog's plights — the plight of stray animals in
     new haven in general, etc. – which is another plus to See Click Fix
     — bringing people together as a neighborhood and community. I am a
     HUGE fan of See Click Fix — I think they make a big difference in
     getting needs addressed as well as improving dialogue on issues.

   "Creating Citizens Out of Residents"
   For Alderman Doug Hausladen, SeeClickFix is more than just a bulletin
   board where anyone can report a non-emergency issue of public concern.
   “What SeeClickFix actually does is it’s creating citizens out of
   residents,” he told me at a coffee shop not far from where the dog was
   reported abandoned.

   Not only that, the site also makes it easy for community groups to form
   around bigger local issues than potholes and abandoned dogs and channel
   public discussion in productive directions. The New Haven Safe Streets
   Coalition, for example, has used SeeClickFix to post more than 3,000
   issue reports. “I remember posting red-light runners all over town,
   back in the day,” Hausladen says, recalling his years as a community
   activist working on that issue. “We’d have little SeeClickFix
   stakeouts. It’s a very open transparent way of documenting an issue.
   We’d create watch areas, and then follow search terms like ‘red-light
   runner’ as well.”

   In 2010, Hausladen was part of a coalition of local community groups
   and activists who used SeeClickFix to try to address another serious
   local problem: food deserts. The Shaw’s supermarket had closed, leaving
   a hole in downtown services. Hausladen posted a call to arms on
   SeeClickFix, urging people to help “Bring back a full-service
   supermarket to New Haven” and asking them to take an online survey
   cataloging their concerns, the better to lobby public officials and
   potential entrepreneurs on the demonstrated need. The post was a major
   hub of conversation in town about the problem, with nearly 200 comments
   and more than 12,000 views. And it took close to a year, but ultimately
   the city and community convinced a Stop-and-Shop to move in to the
   vacant property.

   The existence of SeeClickFix hasn’t solved all of New Haven’s problems,
   of course. Like many cities in America, it is economically and racially
   divided. When Mark Abraham of Data Haven mapped the data from seven
   years of crime incident reports alongside all the SeeClickFix service
   requests, he found that the densest areas of SeeClickFix usage were in
   the safer, more upper-middle-class parts of the city.

   [Crime &amp; 311 New Haven.png]

   That said, as Abraham's chart shows, SeeClickFix reports come from
   every part of the city. Crime reports, unsurprisingly, are concentrated
   in the poorer neighborhoods. To Abraham, this indicated that in less
   well-off areas, not only were residents less likely to use digital
   media, they also might have greater reason not to trust government to
   come to their aid. But SeeClickFix's own data shows that, over time,
   the volume of reports it gets from the different neighborhoods of New
   Haven has balanced out.
   [SCF reports by neighborhood.png]

   Having roughly one in eight New Haven residents as registered users of
   SeeClickFix means that local life works differently. Berkowitz told me
   of a recent case where he had watched someone on the street where he
   works break into a parked car and make off with someone’s bags. He
   called the police, but he also posted a SeeClickFix report, in the hope
   that somehow, someone would read it that knew the car’s owner. The
   thief had left the car window open, and it was starting to rain.

   “In a previous reality, the only way to find that person is to go into
   nearby businesses and ask if someone knows whose car that was, which I
   did do,” Berkowitz reflected.

   In a previous reality.

   He notes that he could have tried calling out to people via a Facebook
   post or tweet, but neither of those services really have the
   “geo-specificity” needed. His post showed up on the local newspapers’
   homepages, and probably even more importantly, it sent emails to anyone
   who had had issues near that location on SeeClickFix. And it turns out
   that the car’s owner was the guest of someone living on the street who
   indeed was a SeeClickFix user.

   “This is something that could have only been created by the Internet,”
   Berkowitz mused. “In essence, we’ve created a community APB
   [all-points-bulletin] for non-emergencies, that works on everything
   from lost animals to car break-ins. You can drop a needle in a
   haystack, and now it’s easier to find it, because the haystack is
   better organized. This is a fundamental shift in the way we think about
   neighborhoods.”

   Internet Hasn't Transformed Politics (Yet), which is available from OR

Germany Releases Open Data Action Plan Amidst Grassroots Enthusiasm and
Pirate Party Turmoil
       The German government on Wednesday unveiled its open data action
       plan to implement the open data charter established by the G8, now
       G7, countries. But while German open government advocates welcomed
       its release, for them it does not go far enough. Even as the open
       data movement is taking new hold in Germany on the local level with
       encouragement from the new Code for Germany effort, in the national
       Pirate Party, the supposed German net party, internal leadership
       disputes are overshadowing its digital agenda. GO
