   Few notice the “spotter car” from Manny Sousa’s repo company as it
   scours Massachusetts parking lots, looking for vehicles whose owners
   have defaulted on their loans. Sousa’s unmarked car is part of a
   technological revolution that goes well beyond the repossession
   business, transforming any industry that wants to check on the
   whereabouts of ordinary people.
   An automated reader attached to the spotter car takes a picture of
   every license plate it passes and sends it to a company in Texas that
   already has more than 1.8 billion plate scans from vehicles across the
   country.

   These scans mean big money for Sousa — typically $200 to $400 every
   time the spotter finds a vehicle that’s stolen or in default — so he
   runs his spotter around the clock, typically adding 8,000 plate scans
   to the database in Texas each day.

   “Honestly, we’ve found random apartment complexes and shopping plazas
   that are sweet spots” where the company can impound multiple vehicles,
   explains Sousa, the president of New England Associates Inc. in
   Bridgewater.

   But the most significant impact of Sousa’s business is far bigger than
   locating cars whose owners have defaulted on loans: It is the growing
   database of snapshots showing where Americans were at specific times,
   information that everyone from private detectives to insurers are
   willing to pay for.

   While public debate about the license reading technology has centered
   on how police should use it, business has eagerly adopted the $10,000
   to $17,000 scanners with remarkably few limits.

   At least 10 repossession companies in Massachusetts say they mount the
   scanners on spotter cars or tow trucks, and Digital Recognition Network
   of Fort Worth, Texas, claims to collect plate scans of 40 percent of
   all US vehicles annually.

   Today, a legislative committee in Boston is scheduled to hold a hearing
   on a bill that would ban most uses of license plate readers, including
   the vehicle repossession business, making exceptions only for law
   enforcement, toll collection, and parking regulation.

   “We have technology rapidly moving ahead in terms of its ability to
   gather information about people,” said state Representative Jonathan
   Hecht, a Watertown Democrat who filed the bill along with state Senator
   Cynthia Creem of Newton, Brookline and Wellesley. “We need to have a
   conversation about how to balance legitimate uses of this technology
   with protecting people’s legitimate expectation of privacy.”

   But Digital Recognition and other so-called “data brokers” who collect
   plate scans are fighting Hecht and Creem’s bill, arguing that repo
   agents are not invading privacy when they scan a license plate, which
   is available for all to see. The data brokers do not disclose the owner
   of the plates, they point out, though customers such as banks,
   insurers, and private investigators have ready access to that
   information.

   Brian Shockley — vice president of marketing at Vigilant, corporate
   parent of Digital Recognition — plans to warn legislators that
   Massachusetts risks getting left behind in the use of a new tool that
   helps fight crime.

   “I fear that the proposed legislation would essentially create a safe
   haven in the Commonwealth for certain types of criminals, it would
   reduce the safety of our officers, and it could ultimately result in
   lives lost,” Shockley is scheduled to say in testimony prepared for the
   hearing before the Joint Transportation Committee.

   License plate scanning technology has been around for decades — the
   British police originally adopted it in the 1970s to track the Irish
   Republican Army members — but it only came into wide use in the last
   decade as cheaper but highly effective models became available. These
   scanners use high-speed cameras and optical character recognition
   technology to capture up to 1,800 plates per minute, even at high rates
   of speed and in difficult driving conditions. The scanner also records
   the date, time, and GPS location of each scan.

   Since 2008, more than 60 Massachusetts police departments have started
   using scanners to track down drivers with unpaid tickets, no insurance,
   or driving stolen vehicles, but the trend has raised concern about
   potential privacy invasions. In December, Boston police suspended their
   use of plate scanners altogether after a Globe investigation reported
   questionable data management, including the accidental public release
   of more than 69,000 license plate numbers that had been scanned over
   six months.

   Meanwhile, private companies were quietly and rapidly finding ways to
   profit from much larger databases with little public discussion.
   Digital Recognition Network, with the help of about 400 repossession
   companies across the United States, has increased the number of license
   scans in its database tenfold since September 2010, and the firm
   continues to add another 70 million scans per month, according to
   company disclosures. Digital Recognition’s top rival, Illinois-based
   MVTRAC, has not disclosed the size of its database, but claimed in a
   2012 Wall Street Journal interview to have scans of “a large majority”
   of vehicles registered in the United States.

   Unlike law enforcement agencies, which often have policies to purge
   their computers of license records after a certain period of time, the
   data brokers are under no such obligation, meaning their databases grow
   and gain value over time as a way to track individuals’ movements and
   whereabouts.

   Massachusetts private investigator Jay Groob said he uses the license
   plate database kept by a third data broker, TLOxp, paying $25 for a
   comprehensive report from the Florida-based company’s “very impressive”
   database of a billion-plus scans.

   “It helps generate other leads,” said Groob, president of American
   Investigative Services in Brookline. “If a vehicle has been missing, or
   you need to locate a person, this gives us another locus to
   investigate.”

   Groob said he would use the database to track a missing person or
   conduct background investigations for child custody or marital
   infidelity litigation. Groob said he “absolutely” foresees vehicle
   location data becoming part of private investigators’ standard toolkit.

   Chris Metaxas, chief executive of Digital Recognition, has promoted his
   database as a useful tool for anyone else who has to confirm a person’s
   real address “because most of the time people are near where their cars
   are.” He told the Globe that his database is already helping the auto
   insurance industry cut down on fraud in which where applicants falsely
   claim to live in a place where insurance rates are lower.

   “Some people have a condo in Florida but actually live in New York ten
   months out of year,” said Metaxas. “Insurers need help to keep this
   kind of fraud under control.”

   But the main commercial use of license plate scanners remains the auto
   finance and auto repossession industries, two professions that work
   closely together to track down people who default on their loans.
   Digital Recognition lists Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan Chase & Co.,
   HSBC Holdings, and Citibank among its clients, while MVTRAC boasts that
   it serves 70 percent of the auto finance industry.
   DRN 40 percent bank clients

   Liran Cohen — owner of Massachusetts Recovery Bureau, a repossession
   company in Lynn — said most banks he works with now require
   repossession contractors to use license plate readers because it is so
   much easier to find vehicles eligible for repossession.

   “The banks want it,” said Cohen, who mounted his license scanner on an
   unmarked tow truck. “All of them make a big deal out of it, since it
   gives them so much value.”

   But the use of scanners has grown so fast that there has been little
   discussion of what limits, if any, to place on repossession agents as
   they trawl for vehicles to impound. A number of such companies
   contacted by the Globe confirmed that they often send their spotter
   cars to commercial lots, such as shopping mall parking lots, because
   those tend to be hotspots for vehicles to repossess.

   In fact, on its website Digital Recognition described what it calls
   good “target environments” for repossession agents, including “malls,
   movie theaters, sporting events, and numerous other locations.” In
   marketing materials, the firm has indicated that it suggests routes for
   repossession companies that focus on workplaces and commercial lots
   during the day and apartment complexes and residential areas at night.

   However, several commercial property owners contacted by the Globe said
   they had no idea repossession agents could be in their parking lots,
   scanning license plates and feeding them into a national database. Some
   said they would consider the practice trespassing.

   “We’re unaware that this is happening, and we’re reaching out to our
   security teams and law enforcement contacts to get a better handle on
   it,” said Les Morris, spokesman for Simon Property Group, which owns
   Copley Place mall in Boston and South Shore Plaza in Braintree.

   “If we saw scanning like this being done, we would throw them out,”
   said Issie Shait, senior vice president of property management at New
   England Development, which owns the CambridgeSide Galleria and Bunker
   Hill Mall District.

   Two repossession companies also told BetaBoston that they focus on
   low-income housing developments, since a significant number of
   residents are delinquent on their car payments.

   “This is just another example of stereotyping,” responded Cambridge
   Housing Authority deputy executive director Michael Johnston, who had
   never heard of plate scanners before. “But our lots are open, and we
   don’t have any gated communities in our system, so I don’t know how to
   prevent it.”

   But the national database companies claim they have no say in where
   their affiliates scan plates, whether on private property or along
   public streets. They said repossession agents and tow truck companies
   are all private contractors who make their own decisions.

   “We have nothing to do with the actual data collection process,”
   Digital Recognition’s Metaxas said in an interview. “We provide
   technology to repossession professionals.”

   The burgeoning private databases of license plates may ultimately be a
   boon to law, as well, giving them access to a trove of license plates
   that many are not allowed to keep themselves, because of data-purging
   requirements. Hecht and Creem’s bill would require law enforcement
   statewide to purge its license plate data after 48 hours.

   Digital Recognition already provides its entire data pool to more than
   3,000 law enforcement agencies nationwide, free of charge for most
   searches. The Massachusetts State Police is a registered subscriber, as
   are the Boston, Cambridge, Somerville, Brookline, and Quincy police
   departments. Even Boston College and Brandeis police have access to the
   firm’s entire scan database.

   License plate reader companies have defeated proposals similar to the
   one before the Legislature’s Joint Transportation Committee, and they
   sued the state of Utah after it enacted a ban on commercial use of
   license plate scanning. In its filing, Digital Recognitionasserts that
   its field agents have a First Amendment right to collect pictures of
   license plates in public places.

   But privacy advocates say the databases are far more intrusive than the
   data brokers admit, arguing that private businesses can easily
   translate anonymous-sounding license plate numbers into owners’ names
   just by obtaining information from states’ motor vehicle registries. In
   Massachusetts, for example, private investigators can get access to the
   Registry of Motor Vehicles directly, and insurance companies and banks
   may already know the plate number for a given individual.

   “Right now, it’s the wild West in terms of how companies can collect,
   process, and sell this kind of data,” says Kade Crockford of the
   American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts. “The best legal minds,
   best public policy thinkers, and ordinary people whose lives are
   affected need to sit down and think of meaningful ways we can regulate
   it.”

   Apple showed off its Apple Watch today and demonstrated how it's also a
   sophisticated fitness and health tracker that measures your heart rate,
   various activity levels, and syncs with your phone. Apple, the company
   that once held your photos and emails and contacts, can now collect a
   whole other kind of additional private data that's even closer to your
   skin—heart rate, movement patterns, sleeping patterns, and more. They
   also have a unique opportunity to use that very same information for
   security. But will they take it? Read More

   Personal data about customers is increasingly valuable to businesses,
   and casinos are among the most voracious data gatherers of them
   all. But unlike others, the gambling industry goes the extra mile to
   reward patrons for sharing their personal information. That’s
   one surprising lesson from “What Stays in Vegas,” a new book about how
   businesses everywhere—and the gambling and entertainment industry in
   particular—collect and use data about their customers.  Read More
