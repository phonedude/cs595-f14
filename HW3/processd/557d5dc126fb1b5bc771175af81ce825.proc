Watch @GeoffreyaMoore on “Crossing the Chasm” In An Age of Big Data Analytics

“Without big data analytics, companies are blind and deaf, wandering out
onto the web like deer on a freeway”
Geoffrey Moore

   At this link and embedded below you can hear directly from a key
   thinker and shaper of big ideas that have influenced most all of us.
   Yes, even if you don’t know it, Geoffrey Moore has been influencing
   you, for years!  This video from Strata 2014 gives a very fast/succinct
   articulation of key ideas from Crossing the Chasm, a model introduced
   in the early 1990’s.  He updates it for today… things have changed a
   bit since the 1990’s… including the massive shift to cloud, mobile,
   consumer and of course Big Data. Is there a role for the Chasm model in
   a world of lean startups? What does it all mean for analysts?

   Although his core model was developed years ago he has updated it with
   very up to date examples. Here is an overview to refresh your memory:
   His model answers a basic question regarding how a community reacts to
   innovation. Communities basically react in five different ways:
    1. Innovators/Technology enthusiasts:  These are way out there at the
       bleeding edge creating the tech.
    2. Early Adopters/Visionaries: Pioneers in technology who will be the
       first to try things to advance concepts.
    3. Early Majority/Pragmatists: Only move for practical reasons. This
       is the bulk of the community.
    4. Late Majority/Conservatives: Another very large slice of the
       community.
    5. Laggards. Very slow to come: Having a hard time understanding the
       tech they have now.

   Early markets are created by the first two categories working together.
   The chasm is created by the large number of waiting pragmatists.
   Pragmatists will not move unless they are under duress. Getting them
   moving is key. Getting them moving is what any innovative technologist
   and startup CEO hopes for.

   Two key principles of success in this year were that you should:
    1. Pick a very specific focus, one great use case. Niche market
       previously impossible problem not addressable.
    2. Commit to provide the “whole product” to these pragmatists in need.
       This usually means teams, with the startup being just a piece of
       the team.

   But think now how things have changed in the age of the lean startup
   and the minimum viable product.  This is not the model of
   Twitter/Facebook/Google. There they worry how fast they can acquire
   eyeballs, how they can engage and convert and enlist. In lean startup
   plays like this there are no chasms. There are landslides of activity
   or bust.

   So these are areas where chasm approaches do not apply.

   However, it is clear to Geoffrey (and to me), that in enterprises it
   does still matter, in a big way.

   Geoffrey’s recommendations for innovators seeking success in the modern
   enterprise world are to focus on this crossing the chasm model still.
   This means finding the user pragmatists in pain who really need
   solutions, then working with teams to enable fielding of whole product
   solutions (with partners and allies).  Success, according to Geoffrey,
   will come with breakthrough products  serving high value use cases with
   compelling reasons to buy.

   His views on some of these compelling use cases and more powerful
   concepts include:
     * Extreme machine learning
     * Collaborative predictive analytics
     * Scale-invariant intelligence
     * Neural networks for machine perception
     * Real-time interactive big data visualization
     * Graph all the things
     * Large scale machine learning
     * Collecting massive data via crowd sourcing
     * Big data for big power: the smart grid
     * The ocean as a big data platform

   Some of this is still pretty abstract, but that is the nature of new
   markets.

   This video is so good you will want to watch it twice:
