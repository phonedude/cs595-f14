EU court backs 'right to be forgotten' in Google case

   A top EU court has ruled Google must amend some search results at the
   request of ordinary people in a test of the so-called "right to be
   forgotten".

   The European Union Court of Justice said links to "irrelevant" and
   outdated data should be erased on request.

   The case was brought by a Spanish man who complained that an auction
   notice of his repossessed home on Google's search results infringed his
   privacy.

   Google said the ruling was "disappointing".

     __________________________________________________________________

   Backers of the "right to be forgotten" are celebrating this ruling. EU
   Commissioner Viviane Reding has called it "a clear victory for the
   protection of personal data of Europeans".

   But the judgement could have huge consequences for anyone who publishes
   material online about individuals, and they will urgently be asking
   their lawyers exactly what it means.

   Can anyone who does not like an old story about them simply demand that
   it is wiped away? That does appear to be the case - the ruling says the
   rights of the individual are paramount when it comes to their control
   over their personal data, although there is a public interest defence
   when it comes to people in public life.

   Google, having won at earlier stages of this legal battle, is both
   surprised and furious at this outcome. But it isn't clear that the
   search firm can do anything about it.

   "We now need to take time to analyse the implications," a spokesperson
   added.
   'Inadequate'

   The search engine says it does not control data, it only offers links
   to information freely available on the internet.

   It has previously said forcing it to remove data amounts to censorship.

   The EU Justice Commissioner, Viviane Reding, welcomed the court's
   decision in a post on Facebook, saying it was a "clear victory for the
   protection of personal data of Europeans".

   "The ruling confirms the need to bring today's data protection rules
   from the "digital stone age" into today's modern computing world," she
   said.

   The European Commission proposed a law giving users the "right to be
   forgotten" in 2012.

   It would require search engines to edit some searches to make them
   compliant with the European directive on the protection of personal
   data.

   In its judgement on Tuesday, the court in Luxembourg said people had
   the right to request information be removed if it appeared to be
   "inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant".

   European Court of Justice, Luxembourg
     * In 2012, the European Commission published plans for a "right to be
       forgotten" law, allowing people to request that data about
       themselves to be deleted
     * Online service providers would have to comply unless they had
       "legitimate" reason to do otherwise
     * The plans are part of a wide-ranging overhaul of the commission's
       1995 Data Protection Directive
     * UK's Ministry of Justice claims that the law "raises unrealistic
       and unfair expectations"
     * Some tech firms have expressed concern about the reach of the bill

   consequences for anyone who publishes material online about
   individuals.

   It appears to say that anyone who does not like an old story about them
   can ask for it to be wiped away, he adds.

   The judgement stresses that the rights of the individual are paramount
   when it comes to their control over their personal data, although there
   is a public interest defence when it comes to people in public life.

   'No legal oversight'

   The ruling came after Mario Costeja Gonzalez complained that a search
   of his name in Google brought up newspaper articles from 16 years ago
   about a sale of property to recover money he owed.

   He said the matter had been resolved and should no longer be linked to
   him.

   Campaign group Index on Censorship condemned the decision, saying it
   "violates the fundamental principles of freedom of expression".

   "It allows individuals to complain to search engines about information
   they do not like with no legal oversight," it said.

   "This is akin to marching into a library and forcing it to pulp books."

   Mr Gonzalez's case is one of scores of similar cases in Spain whose
   complainants want Google to delete their personal information from
   their search results.

   The court said people should address any request for data to be removed
   to the operator of the search engine, which must then examine its
   merits.

       I dont believe its Googles responsibility to censor search results
       whether it be personal requests, DMCA requests or other things.
       However Google cant complain this is censorship when they already
       censor their users to other content.
       The courts just dont understand that censoring the public via a
       Search engine does NOTHING to Stop/Remove or distribute the
       original content
       Tackle the root cause!

       All Google is doing is searching publicly available information and
       providing the results, if a bit of information should be removed
       from public record it isn't Google's responsibility to do it, it's
       the entity that published it. The problem is there are so many
       different standards and even lack of standards depending on the
       source. But of course they don't have deep pockets to fine like
       Google.

       How can Google claim it's a form of censorship if it will be
       individuals rather than governments asking them to delete data?
       People's lives change over time, so the information about them
       online needs to change as well. There's still some posting that I
       made on some political forums years ago that I'd liked to be
       removed because it states political views I no longer hold.

       When the dust settles this is likely to be entirely meaningless
       judgment.
       Google, if it has not already, will simply restructure its business
       so that all that exists in EU is an advertising sales business. The
       EU will have no power to enforce the judgment.
       Future historians will not thank us for deleting information
       because what is irrelevant now may be very relevant in 100 years
       time

       The court ruling should also force Google to establish a clear and
       simple way to contact them to request information to be removed.
       Often times big sites like this give you the go-around and send you
       automatic replies that are not relevant to your request. These
       companies should be audited to make sure they are following the law
       and making these options clearly and easily available to the public
