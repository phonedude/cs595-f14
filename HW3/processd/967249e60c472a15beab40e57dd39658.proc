Women Working on Mars: Curiosity Women's Day

   Posted by Emily Lakdawalla

   22-07-2014 10:57 CDT

   Topics: Curiosity (Mars Science Laboratory)

   Just after completing the primary mission of 669 sols on Mars,
   Curiosity's managers planned a special day -- June 26, 2014 -- in which
   mostly women were assigned to the nearly 100 different operational
   roles. In all, 76 of 102 mission roles were staffed by women. All of
   the roles were filled by people who regularly work them -- the only
   difference, on this day, was that schedules had been aligned so that as
   many women as possible staffed those roles.

   The special day highlighted all the different kinds of work it takes to
   keep this complex mission going. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory put
   together a terrific website explaining all the different jobs and how
   the team members work together to operate the rover. Are you interested
   in a space career, but the only space job you know of is "astronaut?"
   Explore this website!

   To begin, it helps to understand the rover's tactical planning
   schedule. There are hundreds of people who work full- or part-time on
   Curiosity, but many don't fulfill an actual operational role every day.
   If they did, they'd have no time to do scientific research or work on
   improving software or do any of the other myriad things that make these
   missions and their professional lives successful. So everyone usually
   works "on tactical" a few days a week, completing other work on days
   that they're not on tactical shifts.

   Here's a graphical view of the tactical planning schedule for Women's
   Curiosity Day, when they were planning the rover's sol 672. (Apologies
   for the text size on this graphic; you'll probably have to click to
   enlarge it.) The rover's sol 672 would actually begin just a little
   after 6 pm, Pasadena time; the first item in the schedule, the
   "downlink pass" just before 10 am Pasadena time, was the rover's
   evening communication session with a Mars orbiter, in which she
   returned to Earth the highest-priority data from sol 671. So this is a
   day that happened to be relatively well aligned with the Earth
   schedule, at least in California.

Curiosity tactical timeline, June 26, 2014

   The tactical planning timeline for one Curiosity workday, June 26,
   2014. The timeline looks similar for all planning days, but the Earth
   times of meetings shift forward and backward in time depending on
   Curiosity's downlink schedule.

   The first thing to take away from this graph is that there are actually
   three concurrent planning timelines for Curiosity. There is the
   tactical timeline (in which they actually develop the sequence of
   commands that gets sent to the rover), but there are two more planning
   efforts running in parallel: a "supra-tactical" one to begin to develop
   the "sol n+1" plan (in this case, the plan for sol 673), and a
   strategic planning effort (to set the longer term science-driven
   goals). Opportunity does not have such a supra-tactical planning
   effort. Curiosity is a far more complex beast than Opportunity; there
   just isn't enough time in a single planning day to scope and develop a
   set of commands for Curiosity, and there probably never will be, no
   matter how much more efficient they manage to make operations. They
   always begin developing plans an extra day in advance for Curiosity.
   That supra-tactical, sol n+1 effort needs its own staff of tactical
   planners, separate from the group that is planning sol n. There are
   people who have strategic, long-term planning responsibilities on
   Opportunity, but there are still a lot more people involved in a much
   more formal process for Curiosity than for Opportunity. These days the
   Curiosity strategic planning effort includes highly detailed
   pre-planning of Curiosity's future path, to maximize distance while
   minimizing wheel damage; I don't know for sure but don't think that
   Opportunity's path is preplanned in as much detail.

   The other thing to note in the graph is that the schedule is
   relentless. I've been in mission operations and from the moment that
   the downlink teams get to work to the moment that the team approves of
   the command sequence, there is not a lot of time for chit-chat or
   reflection. Most people working tactical operations shifts eat their
   lunches during meetings as they all work together against the clock to
   create the rover's daily list of science-rich, risk-avoiding,
   triple-checked commands. It's exhausting work, but they're driving a
   laser-equipped nuclear-powered robot across another planet, so that's
   some compensation.

   It's fascinating to explore all the different job descriptions on the
   Curiosity Women's Day microsite. There are separate pages full of
   profiles of all of the people who worked management, science planning,
   instrument teams, drive planning, and rover health. Mouse over any job
   title and you can see what each person does. Click on the little (i)
   symbol on each participant's photo to learn about the training and
   experience they received in order to be able to work on a NASA rover
   mission. One thing I learned by browsing those profiles: lots of the
   people fulfilling operational roles on the mission finished their
   education with Master's degrees rather than doctorates. Still, the
   higher-ranked team members mostly have doctorates, whether they're
   scientists or engineers.

   The rover completed a drive on sol 671, and the plan for sol 672 was
   another drive. A Curiosity tactical planning day begins with assessment
   of the downlinked data. In the photo below you can see the engineers on
   the downlink team, at their stations, assessing the brand-new data from
   Mars. You can see the sol 671 data on the monitors behind them: there's
   a partial 3D Navcam panorama, made of a total of 20 photos, that
   includes the direction they planned to drive, and also the area nearby
   the rover that could be targeted with the Chemcam instrument. That
   represents the image data available for planning sol 672. Much of the
   rest of the data acquired on sol 671 (including the rest of the
   complete 360-degree panorama) would not be downlinked for another 5
   hours, after an orbiter passed over Curiosity in the wee hours of the
   Gale crater morning. In charge is Tactical Mission Manager Beth Dewell,
   sitting at the station marked "Activity Lead."

   The downlink side of the engineering team checks the health and safety
   of the rover, and catalogues the data that's been returned. On the
   science side, they look at the images they have available to figure out
   what, if anything, they can do with the science instruments with the
   limited time, power, and data volume available on a drive sol --
   they're tightly constrained on all three counts. That conversation,
   among the scientists, about what they plan to do on that particular
   sol, happens mostly on the telephone, as most of the science team's
   participation in tactical planning now happens remotely. The one
   science-heavy meeting that contains a lot of people physically located
   at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory is the daily Science Operations
   Working Group (SOWG) meeting, where the downlink folks update the team
   on the status of the rover, the science people explain what their plans
   are, and the rover planners (also known as rover drivers) chime in with
   their opinions on choices of targets or other aspects of the plan. Once
   this meeting is over, the major shape of the rover's plan has been
   outlined, and gets split into pieces for engineers and science planners
   to fine-tune. Here's a photo from Women's Day of the room where they
   hold the SOWG meeting. Most of the people in the photo have tactical
   roles on the uplink (commanding) side of things, including the peanut
   gallery of rover drivers in the far corner. Not visible, on the phone,
   are representatives of every one of the rover's instrument teams. The
   SOWG is led by a scientist; science team members rotate into the
   responsibility of SOWG chair for a few days at a time. I think there
   are maybe half a dozen scientists who can be SOWG chairs. Pan Conrad,
   in the red shirt, is the Deputy PI on the SAM instrument and serving as
   SOWG chair for the day.

   A lot of the work to fine-tune plans is done by science instrument
   teams developing the commands for their particular instruments. Here's
   a photo of the dedicated Curiosity operations area at Malin Space
   Science Systems in San Diego, California, where the women pictured here
   developed plans for all three Malin camera systems to be operated on
   sol 672.

   And here's another instrument team, ChemCam, in the French Instrument
   Mars Operations Centre for MSL. They're located in Toulouse, France,
   working on the same Mars time as the mission team, but in an Earth time
   zone nine hours ahead. When the Curiosity mission shifted from Mars
   time to Earth time, tactical operations became much more painful for
   the French (ChemCam), Russian (DAN), and Spanish (REMS) instrument
   teams; rover operations happen very late in their days, so they're all
   working night shifts when they're on tactical operations. Here's a
   video, in French, about the work they were doing.

   In their laboratories across the world, the instrument teams developed
   the sequences for Mastcam to shoot a context image for ChemCam to laser
   a rock, shot more Mastcam images after the drive (like this one), shot
   a MARDI image after the drive, shot more Mastcams for context for
   blind-targeted ChemCam laser zaps after the drive, shot a bunch of
   Mastcam images of the sky (these are for calibration purposes), and
   finished, about 10 minutes after local sunset, with a MARDI image of
   the soil beneath the rover. All that on a sol on which the rover
   drivers planned a 100-plus-meter drive. Not bad for a
   science-constrained sol!

   In another room at JPL -- the one you can see through the open door of
   the SOWG room -- scientists and engineers on the supra-tactical team
   worked together to construct the skeleton of what would be the plan for
   sol 673. The room behind them is a fishbowl, acoustically isolated from
   the adjacent room; meetings are held in there that don't have a home
   anywhere else, and it's often used for "Tiger Team" meetings when there
   are problems to be worked. (You can see one of those intense meetings
   in this video.) This is mostly an engineering effort, especially when
   the planned sol is a drive sol; scientists won't get involved until
   they have images that they can use to target pre-drive observations,
   and that won't happen until sol 672 is over. On this day the
   supratactical effort was led by Supratactical Uplink Lead Ashley
   Stroupe, in the pink shirt in back.

   While all the tactical planning is going on, there is strategic
   planning happening in yet another room at JPL. This particular meeting
   happens only once a week, though the effort of the individual workers
   involved is continuous. The strategic planning effort includes mission
   managers, scientists, and engineers, all developing long-term guidance
   on what the rover should do in order to fulfill its mission goals. Most
   of the people in this room also often work tactical roles, but they
   mostly can't participate in both strategic and tactical planning
   meetings on the same day. There are a lot of leaders in this photo;
   Project Manager Jennifer Trosper is at far left, and Project Scientist
   Joy Crisp is in the floral shirt near far right. Just to illustrate how
   people serve different roles on different days, Strategic Planning Lead
   Nagin Cox, in the ultramarine blue shirt near center, is today serving
   as Tactical Uplink Lead for planning sol 697.

   Completely separate from mission operations is the testbed, where
   engineers test vehicles on Earth before they send commands up to Mars.
   There are two testbed rovers. Maggie is a duplicate of Curiosity, and
   Scarecrow is a body with legs and wheels only, which weighs the same
   under Earth gravity as Curiosity weighs on Mars. They didn't take
   pictures up at the Mars Yard during Women's Day, but they prepared four
   videos of engineers talking about their work there. Two examples:

   Systems engineer Jamie Catchen talks about doing verification and
   validation with the sampling system:

   And here is mechanical wheel wear Tiger Team member Amanda Steffy,
   talking about the work she's doing to help with the effort to break
   rover wheels on Earth in order to learn how not to break them on Mars:

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/9Sb6VFJMk5Q?rel=0

   So the "Women's Day" thing served primarily as an occasion for the
   Curiosity mission to explain all the different roles and
   responsibilities for people working on the mission. But I also think
   it's cool that it's possible to staff a flagship mission predominantly
   with women. I watched the replays of the 45th anniversary of the Apollo
   11 landing on Sunday, and there were almost no women to be seen; behind
   that lack of women in operational roles was a lack of women with the
   qualifications to fulfill operational roles, shut out of degree
   programs and job opportunities. But the one or two women who were there
   broke the path for many, many more to follow them. Now there are lots
   and lots of qualified women, and they're getting hired into NASA
   missions.

   When I tweeted about Curiosity Women's Day when it happened a few weeks
   ago, many people asked me what the gender ratio ordinarily is in
   mission operations. So I asked Joy Crisp (one of two Deputy Project
   Scientists for Curiosity, and formerly Project Scientist for the Mars
   Exploration Rover mission, who acted as Project Scientist for Women's
   Day). I was also curious whether it usually takes 100 people to operate
   the rover on a given day, and how that's changed over the course of the
   mission. Here's what she said (and I'm amused by the scientific rigor
   and caveats in her response):

     We had more operations roles at the start of the mission.  Several
     of the roles that we had at the start of the mission have been
     combined and compacted since then.  And at the start of the mission,
     we had  a lot more people supporting operations in the testbeds
     doing verification and validation, and flight software people
     working on updates.  I haven't done a complete inventory - that
     would be very difficult to extract from the records.  What I can
     tell you is that the JPL "Full Time Equivalent" staffing level early
     in the landed mission was around 300, and now it's around 130.

     Unfortunately it would take a lot of effort to figure out the answer
     the question "On an ordinary day, what fraction of the team is
     female"? What I did figure out was the total team counts and %
     women, which that might be an approximate guide to what the answer
     is likely to be.  Not everyone on the science team directly supports
     operations - some focus on data analysis/processing/assessment, and
     some are much more active in operations than others.

     Engineering team = 188 people, 46 of them are women (24% women)

     Science team = 496 people, 138 are women (28% women)

     There are 4 men and 3 women who are on both the Science &
     Engineering teams, so to calculate the total number of women, I add
     the two totals and subtract 3: Total MSL team size = 677 people
     (188+496-4-3 ), 181 of them (46+137-3) are women (27% women)

   The short version: about one in four members of the Curiosity mission
   team is female. That number actually surprised me, because I'd had the
   impression it was higher. I'd have guessed it was at least one in
   three. Which may be my own observational bias operating!

   So here's something to think about: on Curiosity Women's Day, when 75%
   of operational roles were filled by women, it was effectively a
   reversal of the usual gender ratio. What it felt like to be a man
   working among three times as many women on that day, is "normal" for
   women on the mission.

   I was curious how much things have changed from the time Opportunity
   landed to now, on Curiosity. Since Joy has fulfilled project scientist
   roles on both missions, she was in a good position to answer. "In terms
   of the percentage of women involved, back when I worked on Mars
   Pathfinder and MER, the numbers have increased somewhat but not a whole
   lot. I found a personnel list for MER dated September 2006, and at that
   point in time, the MER science team was 24% women (46/188), which is
   somewhat lower than the percentage on MSL's current science team."
   That's a little disheartening. Joy continued: "We do have a lot of
   young women scientists and engineers on MSL, which is perhaps a sign
   that the next Mars mission will have an even higher percentage. The
   biggest difference between MER and MSL is the huge increase in
   complexity, and even stronger dependence on teamwork because of that
   complexity."

   Joy closed by saying: "I was pleased that so many MSL women were
   enthusiastic about participating in Women's Curiosity Day, wanting to
   inspire young women by showing them the kinds of careers they might
   have.  The men on the project were supportive of this special day too,
   and they helped us make it all possible."

   The website is really fun to explore; I highly recommend checking it
   out. And if you know a kid, girl or boy, who's interested in working in
   space for a living, it's a terrific resource for learning about the
   kinds of work it takes to make a complex mission function, and what
   education you need to fulfill those roles.

   Great write up. Fun fact- the "fishbowl" conference room used to be the
   EDL War Room.

   Graham Hart: 07/24/2014 12:37 CDT
   Interesting food for thought, there - before going freelance I worked
   in several publishing offices where the situation was the opposite of
   that described here: a majority of colleagues being female, sometimes,
   I would guess, as much as 75%.
