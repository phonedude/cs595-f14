How Do the Social Progress Index and the Legatum Prosperity Index Compare?

   29 Oct 2013, Michael Green

   Today saw the launch of the 2013 Legatum Prosperity Index. Now in its
   seventh year, the Legatum Index measures the performance of more than
   140 countries using a range of indicators across eight 'sub-indices',
   including Economy, Education, Personal Freedom and Social Capital. It
   has three big differences to the Social Progress Index: first, it mixes
   together economic and non-economic measures; second, it includes
   measures of inputs as well as outcomes; and, third, it does not include
   environmental sustainability. But do these differences have much impact
   on the results?

   We did a bit of analysis to compare (see graphic below) the Legatum
   Index results with the 50 countries in the Social Progress Index.
   (Note: we've restated the Legatum Index as rankings for these 50
   countries only, so our ranks here will differ from those in the Legatum
   report.) At first glance there's a lot of similarity. Sweden is first
   and Switzerland third on the Social Progress Index; they swap places on
   the Legatum Index but that's a pretty small change. The same is true at
   the bottom of the rankings with Ethiopia, Nigeria, Uganda and
   Mozambique are among the weaker performers on both measures.

   But the superficial similarity belies important differences. Take
   Kazakhstan and Russia, for example, which both perform much worse on
   the Social Progress Index than the Legatum Index (Kazakhstan is 34th on
   the Social Progress Index but 19th on Legatum; Russia 33rd and 25th,
   respectively). So why the difference? A snap analysis suggests that
   Legatum offers a more rosy view of these resource-rich countries
   because it factors in economic measures and leaves out environmental
   measures. Other examples will need a bit more digging: Turkey is 20th
   on the Social Progress Index but only 37th on Legatum; Sri Lanka is
   36th on the Social Progress Index and 24th on Legatum.

   Congratulations to the team at the Legatum Institute. We know how much
   work goes into building an index. They have a terrific data-rich
   website at www.prosperity.com which is well worth exploring.
