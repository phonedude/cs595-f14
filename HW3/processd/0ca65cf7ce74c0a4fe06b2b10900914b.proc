“Facebook Is a Weatherless World”

   This quote, from a piece in Motherboard,  hit me straight between the
   eyeballs:

     Facebook…will not let you unFacebook Facebook. It is impossible to
     discover something in its feeds that isn’t algorithmically tailored
     to your eyeball.

     “The laws of Facebook have one intent, which is to compel us to use
     Facebook…It believes the best way to do this is to assume it can
     tell what we want to see based on what we have seen. This is the
     worst way to predict the weather. If this mechanism isn’t just used
     to predict the weather, but actually is the weather, then there is
     no weather. And so Facebook is a weatherless world.”

     - Sean Schuster-Craig, AKA Jib Kidder

   The short piece notes the lack of true serendipity in worlds created by
   algorithm, and celebrates the randomness of apps (Random) and artists
   (like Jib Kidder) who offer a respite from such “weatherless worlds.”

   What’s really playing out here is a debate around agency. Who’s in
   control when you’re inside Facebook – are we, or is Facebook? Most of
   us feel like we’re in control – Facebook does what we tell it to do,
   after all, and we seem to like it there just fine, to judge by our
   collective behaviors. Then again, we also know that what we are seeing,
   and being encouraged to interact with, is driven by a black box, and
   many of us are increasingly uneasy with that idea. It feels a bit like
   the Matrix – we look for that cat to reappear, hoping for some insight
   into how and whether the system is manipulating us.

   Weather is a powerful concept in relation to agency – no one controls
   the weather, it simply *is*. It has its own agency (unless, of course,
   you believe in a supreme agent called God, which for these intents and
   purposes we can call Weather as well.)  It’s not driven by a
   human-controlled agency, it’s subject to extreme interpretation, and it
   has a serendipity which allows us to concede our own agency in the face
   of its overwhelming truth.

   Facebook also has its own agency – but that agency is driven by
   algorithms controlled by humans. As a model for the kind of world we
   might someday fully inhabit, it’s rather unsettling. As the piece
   points out, “It is impossible to discover something in its feeds that
   isn’t algorithmically tailored to your eyeball.” Serendipity is an
   illusion, goes the argument. Hence, the “I changed my habits on
   Facebook, and this is what happened” meme is bouncing around the web at
   the moment.

   It’s true, to a point, that there’s a certain sterility to a long
   Facebook immersion, like wandering the streets of Agrestic and noting
   all the oddballs in this otherwise orderly fiction, but never once do
   you really get inside Lacy Laplante’s head. (And it never seems to
   rain.)

   The Motherboard article also bemoans Twitter’s evolution toward an
   algorithmically-driven feed – “even Twitter, that last bastion of
   personal choice, has begun experimenting with injecting users’ feeds
   with “popular” content.” Close readers of this site will recall I
   actually encouraged Twitter to do this here: It’s Time For Twitter To
   Filter Our Feeds. But How?.

   The key is that question – But How?

   To me, the answer lies with agency. I’m fine with a service filtering
   my feeds, but I want agency over how, when, and why they do so.

   I think that’s why I’ve been such an advocate for what many call “the
   open web.” The Internet before Facebook and mobile apps felt like a
   collective, messy ecosystem capable of creating its own weather, it was
   out of control and unpredictable, yet one could understand it well
   enough to both give and receive value. We could build our own houses,
   venture out in our own vehicles, create cities and commerce and
   culture. If anything was the weather, it was Google, but even Google
   didn’t force the pasteurized sensibility one finds on services like
   Facebook.

   As we like to say: Pray for rain.
