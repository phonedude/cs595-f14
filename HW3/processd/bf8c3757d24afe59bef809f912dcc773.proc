Abstract

   The dinosaur Plateosaurus engelhardti is the most abundant dinosaur in
   the Late Triassic of Europe and the best known basal sauropodomorph.
   Plateosaurus engelhardti was one of the first sauropodomorph dinosaurs
   to display a large body size. Remains can be found in the Norian stage
   of the Late Triassic in over 40 localities in Central Europe (France,
   Germany, and Switzerland) and in Greenland. Since the first discovery
   of P. engelhardti no juvenile specimens of this species had been
   described in detail. Here we describe the first remains of juvenile
   individuals, isolated cervical and dorsal neural arches from
   Switzerland. These were separated postmortem from their respective
   centra because of unfused neurocentral sutures. However the specimens
   share the same neural arch morphology found in adults. Morphometric
   analysis suggests body lengths of the juvenile individuals that is
   greater than those of most adult specimens. This supports the
   hypothesis of developmental plasticity in Plateosaurus engelhardti that
   previously had been based on histological data only. Alternative
   hypotheses for explaining the poor correlation between ontogenetic
   stage and size in this taxon are multiple species or sexual morphs with
   little morphological variance or time-averaging of individuals from
   populations differing in body size.

Introduction

   The basal Sauropodomorpha are a presumably paraphyletic assemblage
   (Yates, 2003a; Yates & Kitching, 2003; Yates, 2004; Upchurch, Barrett &
   Galton, 2007) and form successive sistergroups to the largest
   terrestrial animals ever known, the Sauropoda, with which they form the
   Sauropodomorpha (von Huene, 1932). Basal sauropodomorphs were the
   dominant high-browsing herbivores from the late Norian until the end of
   the Early Jurassic, when they were replaced in dominance by sauropods
   (Barrett & Upchurch, 2005). The basal sauropodomorph Plateosaurus was
   one of the first larger-bodied dinosaurs. The first fossil remains of
   this taxon were found in 1834 at Heroldsberg near Nuremberg by Johann
   Friedrich Philipp Engelhardt. The first to describe the material was
   Herman von Meyer in 1837 naming it Plateosaurus engelhardti (Moser,
   2003).

   Basal Sauropodomorpha are important for understanding the unique
   gigantism of sauropod dinosaurs (Sander et al., 2004; Sander & Klein,
   2005; Upchurch, Barrett & Galton, 2007; Cerda, Pol & Chinsamy, 2013)
   because they inform us about the plesiomorphic condition from which
   sauropod gigantism evolved. One such plesiomorphic condition may be the
   developmental plasticity seemingly present in Plateosaurus engelhardti,
   expressed in a poor correlation of ontogenetic stage and size (Sander &
   Klein, 2005). Developmental plasticity was initially hypothesized based
   on long bone histology (Sander & Klein, 2005), but in this paper we
   corroborate its presence based on body size at neurocentral suture
   closure, as documented by the first juvenile remains of P. engelhardti
   from Frick, Switzerland. Apart from the Plateosaurus bonebed in Frick,
   juveniles of Plateosaurus had already been mentioned from Greenland
   (Jenkins et al., 1994), but a detailed description of this material was
   not published.

Systematics of Plateosaurus

   A premise of any hypothesis of developmental plasticity is that the
   sample in question is derived from a single species. This necessitates
   a review of the systematics of Plateosaurus. The remains of
   Plateosaurus occur in the middle to the late Norian of Germany (von
   Huene, 1926; von Huene, 1932; Galton, 2001), France (Weishampel, 1984),
   Switzerland (Sander, 1992), and Greenland (Jenkins et al., 1994). The
   type species of Plateosaurus is P. engelhardti (von Meyer, 1837).
   Several more species have been described from other localities in
   Germany such as P. trossingensis (Fraas, 1913) from Trossingen and P.
   longiceps (Jaekel, 1914) from Halberstadt, and P. gracilis (von Huene,
   1908) from the Löwenstein Formation of Stuttgart. Currently the
   Plateosaurus finds from Halberstadt, Trossingen and Frick are assigned
   to one species: P. engelhardti. However, nomenclatorial controversy
   still surrounds this name (Galton, 1984a; Galton, 1984b; Galton, 1985a;
   Galton, 1985b; Galton & Bakker, 1985; Weishampel & Chapman, 1990;
   Galton, 1997; Galton, 1999; Galton, 2000; Galton, 2001; Moser, 2003;
   Yates, 2003b; Prieto-Márquez & Norell, 2011; Galton, 2012).

   A massive abundance of Plateosaurus material found in Plateosaurus
   bonebeds (Sander, 1992) can be found at three localities: Halberstadt
   (Central Germany), Trossingen (Southern Germany) and Frick
   (Switzerland) (see Fig. 1). The locality in Switzerland is in an active
   clay quarry, the Gruhalde quarry, the Keller AG in Frick (Canton
   Aargau, Switzerland), where the first dinosaur fossils were discovered
   in 1963.

Plateosaurus from Frick: geological setting

   Since the focus of this study lies on recently discovered juvenile
   Plateosaurus material, a review of this and other Plateosaurus bonebeds
   is necessary. The Gruhalde quarry exposes a section representing 20
   million years of geological time, from the entire Middle Keuper (Upper
   Triassic) up to the late Sinemurian Obtusus clays (Early Jurassic)
   (Sander, 1990). The Middle Keuper sediments are about 20 m thick, the
   upper 19 m of this section are the Upper Variegated Marls (Rieber,
   1985; Sander, 1992). Plateosaurus remains are embedded in the Upper
   Variegated Marls (Norian), which is partially equivalent in
   stratigraphy, lithology and clay mineralogy to the Knollenmergel and
   Feuerletten beds in Southern and Central Germany (Finckh, 1912; Matter
   et al., 1988), and Eastern France (Weishampel & Westphal, 1986). The
   Upper Variegated Marls at Frick mainly consist of reddish, grayish or
   greenish marls commonly containing carbonate concretions or layers
   (Sander & Klein, 2005). There are three horizons producing dinosaur
   remains (B Pabst, pers. comm., 2012), the lowermost of which represents
   the Plateosaurus bonebed and was the subject of the study by Sander
   (1992). The lowermost horizon is also the source of the material
   sampled histologically (Sander & Klein, 2005) and of the juvenile
   material described in this study.

The miring hypothesis of Plateosaurus bonebed origin

   Mass accumulations of basal sauropodomorph remains in Frick, but also
   Halberstadt and Trossingen in Germany, share the same taphonomy,
   resulting in their description as Plateosaurus bonebeds (Sander, 1992).
   The sediments encasing the bones in all three localities are alluvial
   mudstones overprinted by pedogenesis, representing a floodplain in a
   semiarid climate. Apparently, Plateosaurus individuals as the heaviest
   animals in the environment were preferentially mired in shallow
   depressions when the mud was wet, acting as a deadly trap. Once the
   animal got stuck in the soft ground, trying to pull itself out, the mud
   liquified and the resulting undertow made it impossible to get out.
   This process happened several times over a long period, explaining the
   mass accumulations (Sander, 1992), which cannot be shown to represent
   mass death events, however. Sander (1992) noted the lack of animals of
   less than 5 m total body length and of juveniles in all Plateosaurus
   bonebeds. He suggested that this lack was due to smaller body size and
   the resultant negative scaling of the load on the juvenile feet,
   reducing the risk for animals of less than 5 m in body length to become
   mired. The miring hypothesis of Sander (1992) predicted that no
   juveniles would be found in Plateosaurus bonebeds. Until 2010 this
   prediction was not violated, although the discovery by Sander & Klein
   (2005) of developmental plasticity opened up the possibility that
   juveniles exceeding 5 m in body length would be found.

   Nevertheless, it came as a surprise that juvenile remains of
   Plateosaurus were found in the locality Frick in 2010 and particularly
   2011. The 2011 material represents the remains of at least two
   individuals and primarily consists of isolated neural arches found in a
   bone field catalogued as MSF 11.3. in the lowermost bone layer. The
   term ‘bone field’ had been introduced by Sander (1992).

Ontogenetic studies of sauropodomorph dinosaurs: bone histology and suture
closure

   In general, there are only two methods to ascertain the postnatal
   ontogenetic stage in a dinosaur individual: bone histology and suture
   closure patterns, particularly in the skull and the vertebral column.

   The long bone histology of Plateosaurus engelhardti from the localities
   of Trossingen and Frick has been studied in more detail (Sander &
   Klein, 2005; Klein & Sander, 2007) than any other basal sauropodomorph
   including Massospondylus carinatus (Chinsamy, 1993; Chinsamy-Turan,
   2005). The primary bone of Plateosaurus engelhardti consists of
   fibrolamellar bone tissue, indicating fast growth, but also reveals
   growth cycles demarcated by LAGs (lines of arrested growth). The
   histological sample (Sander & Klein, 2005; Klein & Sander, 2007)
   included individuals that were not fully grown, but specimens showing
   morphological indicators of skeletal immaturity were lacking at the
   time of these histological studies. More importantly, the histological
   ontogenetic stage of similar sized individuals shows great variation
   (Sander & Klein, 2005), indicating a poor correlation between body size
   and age, suggesting developmental plasticity (Sander & Klein, 2005)
   with growth probably being influenced by environmental factors. The
   basal sauropodomorphs Massospondylus carinatus and Mussaurus
   patagonicus do not seem to show such plasticity (Chinsamy, 1993;
   Chinsamy-Turan, 2005; Cerda, Pol & Chinsamy, 2013).

   On the other hand, the histology of sauropod long bones received a
   great deal of attention (Curry, 1999; Sander, 1999; Sander, 2000;
   Sander & Tückmantel, 2003; Curry & Erickson, 2005; Sander et al., 2006;
   Klein & Sander, 2008; Sander et al., 2011). Sauropods revealed a
   fast-growing bone tissue, described as laminar fibrolamellar bone and a
   generally uniform histology. They grew along a genetically determined
   growth trajectory with a certain final size. Sauropods display a good
   correlation between body size/ontogentic stage and age with little
   individual variation in rate of growth and final size (Sander, 2000; de
   Ricqlès, Padian & Horner, 2003; Sander & Klein, 2005; Sander et al.,
   2011).

   Yet another vertebral feature is important to determine osteological
   maturity: the stage of closure in the neurocentral suture between the
   neural arch and its centrum. Brochu (1996) observed different maturity
   stages in extant and extinct crocodilians by studying the neurocentral
   suture closure as an size-independent maturity criterion. He pointed
   out the presence of three different stages of neurocentral suture
   closure: open, partially closed and completely closed. The pattern of
   neurocentral suture closure plays another important role. In different
   groups and also within the same group different patterns of closure can
   be found.

   Within Sauropodomorpha basal sauropodomorphs like Thecodontosaurus
   caducus (Yates, 2003a) and Unaysaurus tolentinoi (Leal et al., 2004)
   seem to show a pattern consistent with a posterior-anterior pattern of
   suture closure. Unfortunately the study on a close relative to
   Plateosaurus, Massospondylus carinatus, does not give a reliable
   pattern of a neurocentral suture closure due to the incompleteness of
   the material of also different specimens (Cooper, 1981). Recently
   described material of a juvenile basal sauropodomorph Yunnanosaurus
   robustus (Sekiya et al., 2013) indicates a roughly posterior-anterior
   pattern of suture closure. Within Sauropoda diverse patterns of suture
   closure can be recognized with suture closure spreading from more than
   one vertebral position and in some cases with no visible order
   (Ikejiri, 2003; Ikejiri, Tidwell & Trexler, 2005; Gallina, 2011).

Objectives of study

   The current study has the major objective to describe and compare
   juvenile neural arch morphology of Plateosaurus. In addition, we want
   to evaluate the implications of the finds of juveniles for the miring
   hypothesis and for the hypothesis of developmental plasticity. We first
   give a detailed morphological description of neural arch morphology
   (laminae and fossae) of the immature isolated neural arches found in
   bone field 11.3. and compare it with the neural arch morphology of
   osteologically mature specimens of Plateosaurus. To address
   developmental plasticity, we need to determine individual body size.
   Since no femora from bone field 11.3. can be reliably associated with
   the isolated neural arches, morphometric analysis of the neural arches
   was used to calculate femur length of the juveniles as a proxy of body
   size. Femur length of the juveniles was then added to the Frick dataset
   on which the hypothesis of developmental plasticity was based. We thus
   tested if developmental plasticity is also reflected by the morphology
   of Plateosaurus engelhardti and not only in its histology. Finally, we
   evaluate the implications of the finds of juveniles for the miring
   hypothesis.

Material and Methods

Material

   The juvenile specimens of Plateosaurus were excavated in the Gruhalde
   clay quarry of the Tonwerke Keller AG in Frick (Switzerland) as part of
   a bone field in 2011. The discovery was part of systematic
   paleontological excavations preceding clay mining each year since 2004.
   Already in 2010, a seemingly juvenile individual had been discovered
   but this specimen remains unprepared. Since the bone field yielding the
   2011 juveniles was the third bone concentration encountered in the 2011
   field season, the bones received consecutive collection numbers
   starting with “MSF 11.3.”. The site was destroyed by mining but the
   exact position of the bonefield was recorded (Swiss State Coordinates:
   642 953.5/261 961, lowermost bone layer, 80–90 cm above base of the
   gray beds). Bone field 11.3. yielded several different juvenile bones
   besides the studied juvenile neural arches, namely isolated centra.
   These were not used for further analyses because they lack diagnostic
   features, making a reliable determination of the position within the
   vertebral column impossible. Vertebrae belonging to the caudal
   vertebral series were not included in this study because the
   neurocentral sutures were closed in all specimens. In addition, tail
   vertebrae can only be assigned to a general region in the tail and not
   to an exact position. Caudal vertebrae, however, will be considered in
   terms of morphological change during ontogeny later on.

   The girdle skeleton of the juvenile individuals is represented by a
   right scapula, right coracoid, a right pubis, a left ischium, and the
   appendicular skeleton is represented by a left femur, a tibia, a
   fibula, a left humerus, and a radius. These bones probably derive from
   immature individuals since the length of the bones is much smaller than
   in adults. The articular surfaces at proximal and distal ends of
   appendicular bones still show an immature stage of ossification. A host
   of ribs and haemapophyses may also derive from the juveniles. This
   study focuses on the isolated neural arches from bone field 11.3. The
   sample includes 17 specimens of isolated neural arches belonging to the
   cervical and dorsal vertebral series (Table 1).
   Table 1:
   List of juvenile neural arches from bone field 11.3 with their
   respective position determined.
   The presacral vertebral column of Plateosaurus engelhardti consists of
   10 cervical vertebrae (Axis to C10) and 15 dorsal vertebra (D1–D15).
   Positions D3, D5, D6 and D10/D11 can be recognized twice in the sample.
   Specimen MSF 11.3.348 is the only caudal vertebra to be studied since
   caudal neural arches, at least in the region, do not reveal characters
   to make a determination of its position possible. Specimens MSF
   11.3.388 and MSF 11.3.169 were not assignable to a position due to poor
   preservation.

   During the excavation, bone field 11.3. was covered with transparent
   foil to document the position of the bones found. This map shows that
   all bones were distributed over the whole area with no recognizably
   articulation or connection to each other (Fig. S1). The next step was
   to ascertain how many animals are represented and if specimens of
   different ontogenetic stage are recognizable. There are at least one
   adult and two juvenile animals represented by bonefield 11.3.

Assignment of the juveniles to P. engelhardti

   Plateosaurus specimen SMNS 13200 from Trossingen (Fraas, 1913; von
   Huene, 1926; Yates, 2003b) is the standard for the morphological
   description of the juvenile specimens. The plateosaurs from Trossingen
   are assigned to P. engelhardti (Galton, 1997; Galton, 2000; Galton,
   2001; Galton, 2012). The neural arch morphology of the Frick material
   described in this study is consistent with the morphology found in SMNS
   13200. All of the Plateosaurus specimens found in Frick show the same
   variance related to sexual dimorphism, intraspecific variation and the
   final size found in the Trossingen specimens (Sander & Klein, 2005;
   Klein & Sander, 2007).

Preservation of the neural arches

   The preservation of the bones in bone field 11.3. is characterized by
   various degrees and directions of diagenetic compaction, making the
   description of the neural arches sometimes challenging. The
   preservation ranges from no obvious compaction to slight dorsolateral
   distortion and heavily dorsolateral distortion with three dimensional
   preservation (see description of neural arches). The most obvious
   feature are fractures, going through the bones. Some of the neural
   arches and other bones like the ischium show another new feature, which
   has not been seen before in material from Frick: tectonic cracks
   originating from regional deformation, which are filled in with a
   ferrous mineral during diagenetic processes (see Figs. 2D, 2E, 4A, 5A,
   9A–9C, 10B, 10C, 11A–11C, 13B, 13C and 18).

   specimens, especially osteologically mature individuals, is important.
   This may reveal ontogenetic morphological variation (Carballido &
   Sander, 2013). We studied three Plateosaurus vertebral columns in
   detail for comparison. Two of these are from Frick (MSF 5, MSF 23) and
   one is from Trossingen (cast of SMNS 13200), see Fraas (1913), von
   Huene (1926), Galton (1985a), Galton (1986) and Sander (1992) on this
   material.

   Specimen MSF 5 consists of a block with two incomplete individuals of
   Plateosaurus, with the smaller animal lying on the top of a larger one.
   The larger animal (MSF 5B) preserves the anterior half of the skeleton
   with a partial and partially disarticulated skull, articulated
   vertebrae from the first cervical to the fifth dorsal vertebra and
   several other disarticulated elements as shown in Fig. S2 (Rieber,
   1985; Galton, 1986; Sander, 1992). The smaller individual (MSF 5A) is
   represented by a left humerus being smaller compared to the right
   humerus of the big animal lying on the right side of the block. The
   remains are prepared right-side up and still remain in the sediment
   (Sander, 1992). The specimen is exhibited in situ at the Sauriermuseum
   Aathal (SMA) on permanent loan from the MSF. For this study the
   complete cervical and partly preserved dorsal vertebrae series of MSF
   5B is of interest. MSF 5B represents the most complete and best
   preserved articulated cervical and partial dorsal series from the
   second cervical vertebra (C2) to the fifth dorsal vertebra (D5) found
   in Frick, anterior body regions being underrepresented due to the
   specific taphonomy of the locality (Sander, 1992). The bones did not
   suffer much distortion compared to the bone field 11.3. specimens and
   are well preserved in three dimensions. All of the vertebrae of MSF 5B
   show completely closed neurocentral sutures. The neural arches show
   well and fully developed laminae and fossae throughout the vertebral
   series with no feature missing.

   MSF 23 is a nearly complete and essentially articulated skeleton of a
   Plateosaurus from Frick, on display at the Sauriermuseum Frick (Sander,
   1992) (Fig. S3). The morphology of the skeleton has not yet been
   described in detail, but it was figured by Sander (1992, Fig. 3) as
   well as in the non-technical literature (Sander, 1993; Sander, 2012).
   The segment of C2–C7 is articulated but separated by a fault from C8 to
   D15 that follow in full articulation. At a first glance, D15 may be
   considered to belong to the sacrum, being a dorsosacral, because it
   seems to be fused with the ilia on both sides. However no other
   Plateosaurus revealed more than three sacrals (Jaekel, 1914; Galton,
   1999; Galton, 2001). The diapophyses of D15 also are not as massive in
   their morphology as those of the sacrals. So the adhesion of D15 to the
   anteriormost part of the sacrum may be due to the age of the animal.
   The neural arches in MSF 23 generally experienced strong dorsolateral
   pressure from the right side during diagenesis. This led to extreme
   deformation of the vertebrae in the specimen. Nevertheless MSF 23 shows
   fully developed vertebral morphology with all laminae and fossae being
   present. All of the neurocentral sutures are completely closed.

   The third specimen is a cast of a complete skeleton from Trossingen
   (SMNS 13200, Fig. S4), exhibited at the Naturama (NAA) in Aarau
   (Switzerland). SMNS 13200 was excavated as a nearly complete
   articulated skeleton in 1911 in the Knollenmergel Beds of Trossingen at
   the Obere Mühle (Fraas, 1913) and forms the basis of the osteological
   description by von Huene (1926). The left forelimb distal to the
   humerus is missing, and the tail is incomplete as well, missing some
   vertebrae. However, the presacral vertebral column is complete and well
   preserved. SMNS 13200 shows good three dimensional preservation with no
   or little influence of compaction on the vertebral column. All
   vertebrae display well developed laminae and fossae with all
   neurocentral sutures being closed.

Methods

   The morphological description of the neural arches follows the
   nomenclature of Wilson (1999) and Wilson et al. (2011). Because of
   their complex morphology and because morphological characters change
   sequentially throughout the axial skeleton (Carballido et al., 2012;
   Carballido & Sander, 2013), sauropodomorph neural arches can be
   assigned to specific positions in the vertebral column with a margin of
   error of one position or less. In sauropods, not only do vertebral
   characters change within one animal but also during the ontogeny of the
   same animal (Carballido et al., 2012). Before a sauropod reached
   osteological maturity, its vertebrae pass developmental stages, often
   displaying more primitive characters known in more basal taxa. To
   determine the stage of osteological maturity of the juvenile
   Plateosaurus a direct comparison of morphological characters to
   osteologically mature (completely closed neurocentral sutures)
   plateosaurs is necessary.

Terminology of laminae and fossae

   The morphological description of the neural arches of this study
   follows the nomenclature of Wilson (1999) for the laminae and Wilson et
   al. (2011) for the fossae of sauropod dinosaurs which can be applied to
   basal sauropodomorphs as well (Wilson, 1999; Wilson et al., 2011). The
   nomenclature for laminae developed by Wilson (1999) is based on
   landmarks on the vertebra, namely the connections a lamina establishes,
   whereas the nomenclatures previously used by other scientists were
   mainly based on the origin the laminae have. The fossae’s names are
   defined by the surrounding laminae (Wilson et al., 2011). Anatomical
   abbreviations are listed at the end of the text.

Morphometrics and 3D visualization

   Simple morphometric analysis was applied to estimate the body length of
   the juvenile Plateosaurus from measurement that can be taken on neural
   arches. In dinosaurs, femur length is a reliable proxy for body mass
   (Carrano, 2006). In the case of Plateosaurus, femur length equals
   approximately 1/10 of body length (Sander, 1992). Since our material
   only consists of isolated neural arches, we had to establish a new
   proxy which is suitable for determining the body lengths of the
   juveniles. We decided to use the zygapophyseal length of the neural
   arches for developing a proxy. Due to the extreme dorsolateral
   compression of some specimens and the better preservation of the pre-
   and postzygapophyses compared to the transerve processes of the neural
   arches, measuring zygapophyseal length appears to be the most reliable
   size proxy. The zygapophyseal length of the neural arches of all
   specimens studied was measured from the tip of the prezygapophysis to
   the tip of the postzygapophysis, thus representing the maximum
   anteroposterior length of a neural arch. For the calculations of body
   lengths of the juveniles, femur length of specimens MSF 5B, MSF 23 and
   SMNS 13200 was measured (Table 2) as maximal length on the medial side.
   The femur of specimen MSF 5B is not preserved, but its scapula is.
   Based on the scapula/femur ratio (76%) of specimen MSF 23 and on
   measured scapula length of MSF 5B, we were able to calculate the femur
   length of MSF 5B.

   The femur length of specimen MSF 5B was calculated with the given

   length of MSF 5B, since the femur itself is not preserved.

   The ratio between zygapophyseal length and femur length of MSF 5B, MSF
   23, and SMNS 13200 were measured to calculate the femur lengths of the
   juvenile specimens of bone field 11.3. (Table S2). Our limited sample
   size of three adult specimens for comparison to the juvenile material
   is due to the taphonomy of Plateosaurus bonebeds, leading to incomplete
   and in most cases disarticulated finds. For the calculation of the
   femur length of the juveniles in percentage, we only used the data of
   specimen SMNS 13200, where the material is the most complete and best
   preserved, compared to all other specimens studied.

   The main problems during measurements of zygapophyseal length in neural
   arches of all specimens studied were caused by poor preservation in
   some bones, with the tips of pre- or postzygapophyses missing.
   Sometimes heavy deformation, e.g., in MSF 23 in the region of the
   posteriormost dorsal vertebrae, made measurements impossible. In
   articulated specimens like MSF 5B and MSF 23, bones like dorsal ribs
   and gastralia obscure parts of the vertebral column.

   Morphometric measurements were taken with a sliding caliper for
   distances between 0 and 150 mm. If the distance was greater than 150
   mm, or the measurement was not accessible with the sliding caliper, a
   measuring tape was used. The measurements were taken to the nearest 0.1
   mm (calliper) and to the nearest millimeter (measuring tape).

   In terms of visualization of the isolated neural arches, we created
   three-dimensional digital models of four representative specimens
   (Files S1–S4). These specimens are two anterior cervical neural arches
   (MSF 11.3.317 and MSF 11.3.258), one middle dorsal neural arch (MSF
   11.3.339), and the posteriormost dorsal neural arch (MSF 11.3.303). We
   computed these models with the photogrammetry software Agisoft
   PhotoScan using sets of professional-grade photographs of the
   specimens.

Results

Description

   Among the juvenile bones, there are six isolated neural arches
   (specimens are listed in Table 1 and Supplemental Information) that can
   be assigned to the cervical vertebral column. This is based on their
   low and elongated appearance in comparison to the taller and shorter
   proportions of the dorsal neural arches (von Huene, 1926). We
   identified eleven dorsal neural arches from the bone field 11.3. sample
   (specimens are listed in Table 1 and Supplemental Information). The
   specimens can be further subdivided into anterior (C1–C5) and posterior
   (C6–C10) cervical neural arches and into anterior (D1–D5), middle
   (D6–D10) and posterior (D11–D15) dorsal neural arches. The
   identification of the position of the neural arches are performed with
   the help of characters and features of diapophyses (d), prezygapophyses
   (prz), postzygapophyses (poz), parapophyses (pa), and the neural
   spines, as described by von Huene (1926) and Bonaparte (1999). The
   laminae and fossae play an important role in the morphology of the
   neural arch (Bonaparte, 1999; Wilson, 1999; Wilson et al., 2011).
   Furthermore the processes of the neural arch change gradually along the
   vertebral column, e.g. in length, shape, size, location on the arch and
   angle at which these stand out from the vertebra (Wilson, 1999).

   The complete vertebral column of Plateosaurus engelhardti consists of a
   rudimentary proatlas, 10 cervical vertebrae, 15 dorsal vertebrae, three
   sacral vertebrae, and at least 50 caudal vertebrae (von Huene, 1926;
   Bonaparte, 1999; Upchurch, Barrett & Galton, 2007). Specimens MSF
   11.3.388 (cervical neural arch) and MSF 11.3.169 (dorsal neural arch)
   displayed the worst preservation and were not described in detail. We
   were unable to reliably determine the position of these two arches
   within the vertebral column since all of the important characters were
   not preserved.

Cervical neural arches

Axis, MSF 11.3.317 (Figs. 2A–2C, File S1)

   The axis is the anteriormost neural arch identified in the bone field.
   With the diapophysis and parapophysis missing, the diapophyseal and
   parapophyseal laminae are not present in the axis. The prezygapophyses
   show much smaller and shorter facets than the postzygapophyses. The
   prezygapophysis is ventrally supported by a single cprl. The tprl
   connecting both prezygapophyses is missing. Short sprl’s line up
   dorsally to the neural spine. As a counterpart the cpol holds up the
   postzygaphysis, and the spol runs up dorsally from the postzygapophysis
   towards the neural spine. A poorly developed tpol connecting the
   postzygapophyses is present. The only fossa is the spof, but it does
   not extend deeply into the neural arch. In ventral view, the pedicels
   show the zipper-like surface of the neurocentral suture, which is
   typical for morphologically immature bones originating from the open
   neurocentral suture (Brochu, 1996; Irmis, 2007). Furthermore, the
   articular surfaces of the postzygapophyses in ventral view are rough
   and were only partly ossified at the time of death. The morphology of
   the axis arch does not differ from the adult.

Third cervical, MSF 11.3.258 (Figs. 2D–2F, File S2)

   The neural arch can be assigned to the third position within the
   vertebral column. No diapophysis or parapophysis is present, therefore
   the arch is missing any diapophyseal and parapophyseal laminae.
   Postzygapophysis and prezygapophysis are both small and form a low
   angle, indicating that this neural arch is an anterior cervical one.
   The tprl (the connecting lamina between the prezygapophyses) and tpol
   are well developed. The sprl is hardly developed in contrast to the
   spol being quite present. The cprl and cpol are well developed. Like in
   the axis, the spof is present and becomes deeper. Though less
   developed, the sprf is present now. Zipper-like suture surfaces on the
   pedicels are recognizable in ventral view.

Fourth cervical, MSF 11.3.371 (Figs. 3A–3E)

   The arch shows a partly preserved diapophysis on the right lateral
   side, but still no parapophysis is present. Nevertheless, diapophyseal
   as well as parapophyseal laminae do not extend onto the arch. The
   prezygapophyses of MSF 11.3.371 are much more elongated compared to
   prezygapophyses in more anterior neural arches and the postzygapophyses
   of the same arch. The articular surfaces have a quite low angle of less
   than 45°. While the cpol remains short in length, the cprl is a thick
   elongated lamina. Sprl and spol are well developed along with the sprf
   and the spof, with the spof being the deeper and broader fossa. Other
   fossae are not present.

Sixth cervical, MSF 11.3.074 (Figs. 4A and 4B)

   The partly preserved diapophysis fully moved dorsally onto the neural
   arch and is situated at the midlength of the neural arch. No
   parapophysis is present. The prezygapophysis and postzygapophysis seem
   to be very steeply angled, and the surface of the articular facets is
   rough, suggesting a cover by cartilage. This is unlike in adults, where
   zygapophyseal articular facets are well ossified and smooth. Intense
   lateral compaction of the arch with a sligthly ventral to dorsal shift
   is recognizable. The acdl emerges as a thin lamina going anterodorsally
   up from the anterior part of the junction between centrum and neural
   arch to the tip of the prezygapophysis, recognizable on both the left
   and right lateral side; concomitant with the presence of a small and
   shallow prcdf. The pcdl is not present. The neural spine is higher than
   in the anterior cervicals. Sprl, spol, tprl and tpol are present. Both
   cprl and cpol seem to be shorter than in the more anterior cervical
   arches. The sprf is not well developed whereas the spof is deeper. The
   pedicels lack the zipper-like structures due to poor preservation.

Tenth cervical, MSF 11.3.366 (Figs. 5A and 5B)

   In the tenth cervical neural arch the cervicodorsal transition is
   visible. Posteriormost cervical neural arches show strong reduction in
   centrum and zygapophyseal length in comparison to the previous arches.
   The neural spine gets higher. The size, shape and functions of
   diapophyses change due to dorsal ribs which have to be supported. The
   ribs are supported from below by parapophyses which migrate onto the
   dorsal neural arches (Wilson, 1999). Though the diapophysis of the
   specimen is not complete with the tip missing, the diapophysis arises
   fully from the neural arch. As a consequence, all of the diapophyseal
   laminae are present and well developed. These include the acdl, which
   is a thin lamina in the sixth cervical (MSF 11.3.074), but which is
   thickened and well established in specimen MSF 11.3.366. The
   diapophysis is well supported ventrally by the pcdl, being the stronger
   and broader lamina, and the acdl. The cdf is still simple and not deep.
   On the contrary, the prcdf and pocdf are deep and extensive. The
   surface of the prezygapophyses and postzygapophyses are much more
   extensive, which is not the case for zygapophyses of anterior
   cervicals. Still, a parapophysis is not visible, but the laminae
   connecting the diapophysis with the prezygapophysis (prdl) and the
   diapophysis with the postzygapophysis (podl) are distinctly developed.
   All the other laminae like sprl, spol, tprl, tpol, cprl and cpol as
   well as sprf and spof are well developed. In contrast to the neural
   spine of more anterior cervicals, the neural spine of this specimen is
   much thicker. Specimen MSF 11.3.366 is the anteriormost specimen in the
   cervical series to exhibit a hyposphene and hypantrum for further
   support of the vertebral column.

Dorsal neural arches

   Anterior neural arches from the first to the seventh dorsal are most
   abundant in bone field 11.3., and only two posterior dorsal neural
   arches can be recognized. Some positions are represented twice like the
   third, the fifth, the sixth and the tenth/eleventh dorsal. All of the
   dorsal neural arches show well developed hyposphenes and hypantra if
   this region is preserved. Zipper-like sutural surfaces are preserved
   for the dorsals MSF 11.3.360, MSF 11.3.167, MSF 11.3.095, MSF 11.3.107
   and MSF 11.3.339.

Third dorsal, MSF 11.3.360 (Figs. 6A–6D)

   This specimen is one of the most anterior dorsal neural arch in the
   dorsal series. With the shortest and thickest neural spine within the
   whole vertebral series, being nearly square in shape in dorsal view and
   sticking out from the arch at a right angle, the neural arch can be
   identified as a third dorsal (von Huene, 1926). The diapophysis is
   slightly oblique and gently posteriorly directed. Furthermore, three
   very deep fossae are well recognizable below the diapophysis (prcdf,
   pocdf and cdf). A first sign of a slight parapophysis articular facet
   is recognizable on both sides of the bone. The parapophysis still seems
   to have been located more on the centrum than on the neural arch. The
   much broader facets of the prezygapophyses in comparison to small ones
   of the postzygapophyses are remarkable. Nonetheless, both show rough
   articular sufaces like all the cervical neural arches. All laminae
   (acdl, pcdl, prdl, podl, sprl, spol, cprl and cpol) are fully
   developed.

Third dorsal, MSF 11.3.376 (Figs. 7A–7C)

   Specimen MSF 11.3.376 can also be identified as a D3 due to the same
   diagnostic characters. However, there are some striking differences in
   comparison to the previous specimen. The prezygapophyses are much
   smaller and seem to be elongated instead of being broad. This may be
   due to preservation, though the shape of MSF 11.3.360 appears to be
   little affected by diagenetic deformation. MSF 11.3.376 experienced
   dorsoventral crushing. In addition, the parapophysis articular area has
   clearly developed and is situated on the neural arch while the
   parapophyses of MSF 11.3.360 still articulate with the centrum, because
   they are hardly visible. All laminae are fully present and developed,
   whereas the acdl is slightly truncated by the parapophysis articular
   facet.

Fourth dorsal, MSF 11.3.049 (Figs. 8A and 8B)

   In the fourth dorsal neural arch, the thickness of the spine decreases
   a little and the spine gets longer. Unfortunately the tip of the
   diapophysis is missing on both sides. No parapophysis is visible. In
   all likelihood, the parapophysis articular facet is situated on the
   centrum. This may lead to the assumption that we deal with a cervical,
   but the neural spine indicates the specimen to be a dorsal. The
   appearance of the prezygapophyses and the very short postzygapophyses
   also argue for a dorsal neural arch. Fossae and accompanying laminae
   are well developed. All three fossae below the diapophysis are very
   deep and well visible (prcdf, cdf and pocdf). No parapophysis
   influences the laminae and fossae. Tough the cdf seems to be not as
   deep as in the third dorsals. The well established laminae and fossae
   indicate the neural arch belongs to a fourth dorsal. Cprl and cpol
   distinctly arise from the prezygapophysis and postzygapophysis,
   increasing the general height of the neural arch.

Fifth dorsal, MSF 11.3.067 (Figs. 9A–9C)

   The fifth dorsal neural arch shows partly preserved diapophyses, but no
   parapophysis articular facet due to poor preservation. The neural spine
   shows that a posterior inclination is seen from now on backwards in the
   vertebral column. The left lateral side of the arch shows that all the
   laminae and fossae are well developed in this specimen. As expected,
   the prcdf begins to diminish in size and extent due to the parapophysis
   articular facet moving dorsally onto the neural arch, also slowly
   closing the acdl, separating the lamina into acpl and ppdl in posterior
   dorsal neural arches. In addition, the parapophysis articular facet
   also influences the prdl to the extent that it recedes. This process
   takes place stepwise, visibly beginning in the fifth dorsal and being
   complete in the eighth dorsal in which there are only two fossae left
   below the diapophysis (pocdf and cdf).

   This is another neural arch belonging to a fifth dorsal vertebra. The
   specimen is heavily crushed on the left side, leaving the right side
   for the description. All laminae are well developed beneath the
   diapophysis with deep fossae (pcdl, acdl, prdl, podl, sprl, spol, cprl
   and cpol). A parapophysis articular facet is present interrupting the
   acdl. The appearance of the zygapophyses conforms with those of
   specimen 11.3.067.

Sixth dorsal, MSF 11.3.095 (Figs. 11A–11C)

   Specimen MSF 11.3.095 is assigned to the sixth position in the dorsal
   vertebral column. The diapophyses are posteriorly oriented, suggesting
   a middle dorsal neural arch. The prezygapophyses are elongated in
   contrast to the postzygapophyses being shorter and smaller in expanse.
   Furthermore all laminae are fully developed. At the anterior end of the
   arch, dorsal of the neurocentral suture, a distinctive parapophysis
   articular facet is present on both sides. The parapophysis articular
   facet displaces the acdl, giving rise to the ppdl, connecting the
   parapophysis from ventral to dorsal with the diapophysis, and the acpl
   and the prpl. The prpl connects the parapophysis anterodorsally with
   the prezygapophysis. The prdl is still well visible. All the rest of
   the laminae are well developed, like in the arches described before.
   The same applies to all of the fossae. Further evidence for the
   identification of the specimen as a sixth dorsal is that the prcdf
   becomes narrower and decreases in depth compared to the prcdf in more
   anterior neural arches.

Sixth dorsal, MSF 11.3.107 (Figs. 12A–12C)

   This specimen can also be identified as a sixth dorsal neural arch. All
   features seen in this specimen coincide with those of specimen MSF
   11.3.095. The bone is complete although the diapophysis is broken off
   on the left side and is diagenetically recemented to the arch.

Seventh dorsal, MSF 11.3.339 (Figs. 13A–13C, File S3)

   Although being the most complete and best preserved specimen of all,
   this neural arch is strongly influenced by anteroposterior compaction.
   This implies an extremely posteriorly directed diapophysis and a
   constrained elongation of the prdl on the right lateral side. Aside
   from the preservation, the prdl is much shorter and more inconspicuous
   than in the more anterior neural arches which argues for a position
   around the seventh dorsal, where the prdl is fused with the ppdl, the
   acdl is consumed by the acpl, and the cprl is disrupted by the prpl,
   connecting the parapophysis anterodorsally with the prezygapophysis.
   Unfortunately, no parapophysis articular facet is preserved.
   Furthermore, the specimen impressively shows the rough and only partly
   ossified zygapophyseal articular surfaces.

   is an indicator of osteological immaturity. Specimen MSF 11.3.339 shows

Tenth/Eleventh dorsal, MSF 11.3.241 (Figs. 14A–14C)

   This is the posteriormost position represented by the neural arches
   found in bone field 11.3., being the tenth or eleventh dorsal neural
   arch. The arch has broad and extensive diapophyses, oriented nearly at
   right angles to the arch. The partly preserved neural spine does not
   show any indication of a bifurcation in the posterior part, which is
   mainly the reason why the neural arch cannot be assigned to the 12th up
   to the 15th dorsal. A sure indicator for a posterior dorsal position
   are the presence of only two fossae below the diapophyses. The prdl has
   fully vanished from the arch in this position. A parapophysis articular
   facet is well preserved on the left lateral side of the specimen.
   Prezygapophyses and postzygapophyses are both short compared to
   prezygapophyses and postzygapophyses in the middle dorsal neural arches
   (i.e., the fifth, sixth, and seventh dorsal). In all middle and
   posterior dorsal neural arches, the articular surfaces of the
   zygapophyses are horizontal. At the same time, the hyposphene and
   hypantrum are very distinctive.

Tenth/Eleventh dorsal, MSF 11.3.303 (Figs. 15A–15C, File S4)

   This posterior dorsal neural arch can also be assigned to a position
   around the tenth dorsal. The diapophyses are not well preserved,
   missing the tip on the right lateral side and not being preserved on
   the left lateral side, to which a partly preserved bone (MSF 11.3.304)
   is cemented. Presumably this bone is a posterior caudal vertebra. Again
   the diapophysis is directed laterally at a 90-degree angle like in
   specimen MSF 11.3.241. The shape and appearance of the prezygapophyses
   and postzygapophyses also coincide with those of the previously
   described specimen. In contrast to specimen MSF 11.3.241, the
   postzygapophyses show completely ossified articular surfaces. All
   laminae and fossae are well developed.

Minimal number of individuals (MNI)

   The assignment to the position of the neural arches indicates the
   minimum number of juvenile individuals (MNI) represented in bone field
   11.3. In the dorsal series, some positions are represented twice, such
   as the the third dorsal (MSF 11.3.360 and MSF 11.3.376), the fifth
   dorsal (MSF 11.3.067 and MSF 11.3.167), the sixth dorsal (MSF 11.3.095
   and MSF 11.3.107), and the tenth/eleventh dorsal (MSF 11.3.241 and MSF
   11.3.303). The MNI of juvenile Plateosaurus from bone field 11.3. is
   thus two.

Morphometric analysis

Neural arch size measured as zygapophyseal length

   The values of zygapophyseal length of the isolated neural arches
   pertaining to juveniles and described here and of the specimens MSF 5B,
   MSF 23 and SMNS 13200 were measured for morphometric analysis (Table
   S1). The trend of zygapophyseal lengths along the cervical and dorsal
   series shows a clear pattern in all adult specimens studied (MSF 5B,
   MSF 23 and SMNS13200) (Fig. 16). This pattern is roughly followed by
   the disarticulated neural arches from bone field 11.3 as well. The
   anterior cervical neural arches show a rapid increase in zygapophyseal
   length, with C4/C5 showing the maximal length. Posteriorly, a decrease
   in the length of the cervical neural arches takes place, with the
   anterior dorsals (D3) showing the lowest value of zygapophyseal length.
   Subsequently the zygapophyseal length again increases, though at a much
   lower rate than in the anterior cervicals. The comparison of neural
   arches at the same positions suggests that the two juvenile individuals
   are of a slightly different size. The maximal size difference is
   approximately 20%.

Figure 16: Zygapophyseal lengths in the vertebral column of specimens MSF
11.3., MSF 5B, MSF 23 and SMNS 13200.

   The zygapophyseal lengths of all specimens follow a distinct pattern
   throughout the vertebral column. The zygapophyseal lengths show a sharp
   increase in the anterior cervical series. The posterior cervicals
   decrease in length reaching their minimum length at the third dorsal
   neural arch. Afterwards they increase at a much lower rate than in the
   anterior cervical series. Specimen SMNS 13200 with the greatest femur
   length of all specimens studied, also shows greater zygapophyseal
   lengths. The juvenile MSF 11.3. specimens generally show a
   zygapophyseal length placed below of those from the mature specimens
   and only intervene with those of MSF 23 at some positions in the
   posteriormost cervical series.

   DOI: 10.7717/peerj.458/fig-16

   Specimen SMNS 13200 with the greatest femur length (685 mm) generally
   possesses the greatest zygapophyseal lengths. Except for a few
   outliers, its lengths are clearly greater in comparison to the other
   specimens. Though specimen MSF 23 is the second largest individual on
   the basis of a femur length of 610 mm, the zygapophyseal lengths of the
   slightly smaller MSF 5B (calculated femur length of 565 mm), overlap
   with those of MSF 23. Throughout the vertebral series, the
   zygapophyseal lengths of the isolated neural arches are less than those
   of the adult specimens. The zygapophyseal lengths of the juveniles only
   overlap with those of specimen MSF 23 in the cervical series which may
   be due to the strong deformation in MSF 23.

Zyg/Fe ratios

   Zygapophyseal length was calculated as a percentage of femur length
   (Table S2) to estimate femur length from the isolated neural arches
   (Table 3). With the help of these ratios, it is possible to estimate
   femur length of the juvenile specimens, which is documented in Table 3.
   Though the Zyg/Fe ratios of MSF 5B, MSF 23 and SMNS 13200 show a wide
   range between 12.5 and 28.3% (Table S2), they all reflect a pattern,
   following the regular change in zygapophyseal length throughout the
   vertebral column visible in all specimens. The pattern of increase and
   decrease of zygapophyseal lengths explains the wide range in the Zyg/Fe
   ratios in these individuals. The calculated femur lengths of the two
   11.3. individuals range from 478.9 to 594.9 mm, depending on position
   of the neural arch and size of the individual. Again the variation in
   zygapophyseal length, which can be seen in all specimens studied,
   accounts for the relatively large variation in estimated femur length.
   Based on the vertebral positions that are represented twice, the femur
   length estimate for the larger juvenile is between 539 mm and 595 mm
   and that for the smaller juvenile is between 479 mm and 593 mm.
   Table 3:
   Calculated range of femur length of the MSF 11.3. specimens.
   For the calculation of a range of femur length of the juvenile MSF
   11.3. specimens we only used the Zyg/Fe ratio of specimen SMNS 13200
   due to completeness and good preservation of this specimen. The femur
   length of the juvenile specimens lies in between 479 and 595 mm.
   Lengths given in parentheses are again resulting from the longer
   specimen at positions occupied twice (refer to Table S1). The femur
   length estimate for the larger juvenile is between 539 mm and 595 mm
   and that for the smaller juvenile is between 479 mm and 593 mm.

Discussion

Ontogenetic changes in vertebral morphology

   Morphological changes through ontogeny in sauropodomorphs are poorly
   known because juveniles are rarely found and are mainly represented by
   late juveniles to subadult specimens (Ikejiri, Tidwell & Trexler, 2005;
   Tidwell & Wilhite, 2005). Until now there are just four basal
   sauropodomorphs and two sauropods with embryos or very young specimens
   known: Massospondylus carinatus (Reisz et al., 2005; Reisz et al.,
   2012), Mussaurus patagonicus (Bonaparte & Vince, 1979; Otero & Pol,
   2013), Lufengosaurus (Reisz et al., 2013), the basal sauropodomorph
   Yunnanosaurus robustus (Sekiya et al., 2013), a baby titanosauriform
   closely related to Brachiosaurus (Carballido et al., 2012), and
   Europasaurus (Sander et al., 2006; Marpmann et al., 2011; Carballido &
   Sander, 2013). The most detailed study of ontogenetic changes in
   vertebral morphology has been done on Europasaurus holgeri, with
   different ontogenetic stages being recognized and defined (Carballido &
   Sander, 2013). Though in most cases isolated bones and incomplete
   specimens of vertebral column remains exacerbate studies on
   morphological changes through ontogeny (Carpenter & McIntosh, 1994;
   Foster, 2005).

   Based on neural arch morphology, Carballido & Sander (2013) recognized
   five morphological ontogenetic stages: early immature, middle immature,
   late immature and two stages of maturity. In the early and middle
   immature stage, laminae and/or fossae of a neural arch are not fully
   developed. In the late immature stage all morphological characters of
   adults are already present, but the neurocentral suture remains open.
   The ontogenetic stage of the juvenile MSF 11.3. specimens equals the
   late immature stage found in Europasaurus holgeri.

   The comparison of the morphology of cervical and dorsal neural arches
   between the juvenile MSF 11.3. specimens and the mature Plateosaurus
   did not reveal any differences at all. Laminae as well as fossae are
   all well developed in all osteologically mature individuals as well as
   in the juvenile Plateosaurus of bone field 11.3. The only distinction
   which can be made are the fully open neurocentral sutures in the 11.3.
   juveniles and the fully closed and invisible neurocentral sutures in
   the mature individuals (MSF 5B, MSF 23 and SMNS 13200).

   The series of ontogenetic changes in the neural arch morphology as
   detected for Tazoudasaurus (Allain & Aquesbi, 2008), the brachiosaurid
   SMA 0009 (Carballido et al., 2012), Phuwiangosaurus (Martin, 1994) and
   especially the camarasauromorph Europasaurus holgeri (Carballido &
   Sander, 2013) cannot be observed in Plateosaurus. While this may be due
   to the late immature stage of the juveniles from bone field 11.3., it
   may be a plesiomorphy of basal sauropodomorphs. Basal sauropodomorphs
   are more plesiomorphic in their neural arch morphology than more
   derived sauropods and may have been more plesiomorphic in having less
   ontogenetic change in vertebral morphology. The function of laminae in
   sauropodomorphs was in the structural support of the neck and trunk
   region (Osborn, 1899; McIntosh, 1989), but also evolved as a correlate
   of axial pneumaticity (Seeley, 1870; Wilson, 1999; Taylor & Wedel,
   2013). Most probably laminae can be explained by both factors.

Size and ontogenetic stage in Plateosaurus

   The fully open neurocentral sutures of the neural arches described in
   this study are a reliable indicator for immaturity (Brochu, 1996).
   However, the calculated femur length for both juvenile individuals
   ranges between 479 mm and 595 mm, indicating that these were not
   smaller than many mature individuals from the Frick Plateosaurus
   bonebed. Histologically mature animals from Frick and Trossingen
   studied in Sander & Klein (2005) display a femur length between 480 mm
   and 990 mm. The femur lengths of osteologically immature, as well as
   osteologically mature, specimens and histologically mature animals
   merge into one another (Fig. 17). Furthermore, comparing the
   osteologically mature specimen MSF 5B (femur length: 565 mm) with the
   juveniles we assume that the immature animals would have become larger
   than MSF 5B. Our justification is the bone histology of a newly
   discovered (2012) associated skeleton (MSF 12.3.) with open
   neurocentral sutures in the cervical and dorsal column. Femoral
   histology of this individual indicates that it was still growing
   rapidly (see histological criteria in Sander & Klein, 2005; Klein &
   Sander, 2007) and was far from final body size. Importantly, both the
   current study and Sander and Klein’s study in 2005 show no correlation
   between age and size. Developmental plasticity is not only observable
   in histology of Plateosaurus, but also corroborated by its morphology.

   13200 (gray/black); and the femur lengths of histologically mature
   specimens (black) from Sander & Klein (2005). The femur length range of
   the juveniles has been divided up into 10 mm intervals to make it more
   practical in the diagram. The column diagram clearly shows the juvenile
   specimens and mature specimens merging into one another. The striking
   outlier of the whole diagram is specimen IFG with a remarkably great
   femur length of 990 mm. Nevertheless the diagram illustrates poor
   correlation between age (maturity) and size. Developmental plasticity
   is supported by histology as well as morphology.

   However, as discussed in the introduction, alternative explanations to
   developmental plasticity such as the presence of several Plateosaurus
   species represented at the locality of Frick cannot be excluded, and a
   combination of several hypotheses (developmental plasticity, different
   species, populations separated in time, and/or sexual dimorphism) still
   remain possible and cannot be tested without further detailed study of
   the material from the Plateosaurus bonebeds and the taphonomy of the
   bonebeds.

Patterns of neurocentral suture closure

   The isolated neural arches from bone field 11.3. contribute little to
   our understanding of the pattern of neurocentral suture closure in
   Plateosaurus. Circumstantial evidence consists of the lack of isolated
   posterior dorsals and caudal arches compared to the large number of
   caudal vertebrae preserved in the bone field (Fig. 18). This is
   suggestive of suture closure beginning in the tail and the posterior
   dorsal region. Further we lacked most of posterior cervical neural
   arches (C7–C9) in our sample. Those, as well as posterior dorsals
   (D12–D15), may have had completely closed neurocentral sutures and,
   despite being present in bone field 11.3, were not assignable to
   because the only reliable character for immaturity in our specimens
   (open neurocentral sutures) is not present. This observation might
   suggest a pattern of suture closure spreading from more than one
   vertebral position.

Implications for taphonomic hypothesis

   As noted, the taphonomic hypothesis for the origin of the Plateosaurus
   bonebeds of Central Europe proposed by Sander (1992) predicted a size
   threshold for animals below which animals did not become mired.
   According to Sander (1992), this would explain the lack of juveniles
   because of their small size. While the discovery of juveniles in the
   lowermost bone horizon seemingly contradicts the hypothesis of Sander
   (1992), this is not the case. The juvenile Plateosaurus individuals
   described in this study are as large or even larger than the smallest
   fully grown Plateosaurus present at Frick, upholding the view that a
   size threshold existed that kept animals smaller than a 5-m
   Plateosaurus from becoming mired in the mud traps. This conclusion was
   implicit in the work of Sander & Klein (2005) and Klein & Sander
   (2007), but it was not expressed because histological immaturity could
   not be properly correlated with skeletal immaturity because isolated
   neural arches were not known from Frick at the time.

Conclusions

   This study focuses on the first remains of juveniles of the basal
   sauropodomorph Plateosaurus engelhardti in Frick, Switzerland. P.
   engelhardti can be found in over 40 localities in Central Europe
   (Sander, 1992). The juveniles studied come from the locality of Frick,
   one of three localities preserving abundant remains of Plateosaurus and
   sharing the same taphonomy. These localities were described as
   Plateosaurus bonebeds by Sander (1992). The juveniles were found in a
   bone field in the lowermost bone horizon in the Gruhalde clay quarry of
   the Tonwerke Keller AG, revealing a concentration of several juvenile
   and adult bones. The most interesting specimens were isolated neural
   arches, representing an MNI of two juveniles that slightly differed in
   size. The juvenility and osteological immaturity of the remains can
   reliably be linked to the lack of fusion of the neural arches to the
   centra (Brochu, 1996). The ventral surface of the pedicel reveals the
   characteristic zipper-like surface of the suture, but the morphology of
   the immature neural arches does not differ from the morphology of the
   osteologically mature specimens (MSF 5B, MSF 23 and SMNS 13200) studied
   for comparison. Thus, the juvenile specimens of P. engelhardti seem to
   represent late immature individuals. Patterns of abundance in the bone
   field hint at a suture closure pattern in Plateosaurus from posterior
   to anterior. However, a pattern of suture closure spreading from more
   than one vertebral position is possible.

   Morphometric analysis based on the ratio of zygapophyseal length to
   femur length indicates the femur length of the juvenile specimens to
   have been between 479 and 595 mm. Thus these animals were larger than
   the smallest histologically fully grown individual with a femur length
   of 480 mm from Frick (Sander & Klein, 2005) and most probably would
   have become larger than another individual with a femur length of 565
   mm. The morphometric analysis thus independently confirms the poor
   correlation between age and size in the finds from Frick assigned to P.
   engelhardti, most likely reflecting pronounced developmental plasticity
   of Plateosaurus (Sander & Klein, 2005). However, alternative
   explanations such as the presence of several Plateosaurus species at
   the locality Frick cannot be excluded, and a combination of several
   hypotheses (developmental plasticity, different species, populations
   separated in time, and/or sexual dimorphism) still remain possible and
   cannot be tested without further detailed study of the material from
   the Plateosaurus bonebeds and the taphonomy of the bonebeds. Our study
   also failed to falsify the taphonomic miring hypothesis of Sander
   (1992) explaining the origin of the Plateosaurus bonebeds. While
   juvenile, the newly described individuals are not smaller than some
   adults and above the size threshold for miring.

Supplemental Information

Zygapophyses lengths of the juvenile specimens MSF 11.3., MSF 5B, MSF 23 and
SMNS 13200

   Zygapophyses lengths in mm of the juvenile specimens MSF 11.3., MSF 5B,
   MSF 23 and SMNS 13200 with their respective position in the vertebral
   column. As noted in the description some positions can be recognized
   twice. The zygapophyses lengths in parentheses belong to the longer
   neural arch of those to be found twice in the sample. The specimen
   numbers of the 11.3. specimens is listed in Table 1. D3 (MSF
   11.3.376/77.1 mm and MSF 11.3.360/86.7 mm). D5 (MSF 11.3.167/94.2 mm
   and MSF 11.3.067/101.1 mm). D6 (MSF 11.3.095/108.5 mm and MSF
   11.3.107/109.2 mm). D10/D11 (MSF 11.3.241/110.8 mm and MSF
   11.3.303/121.6 mm). Gaps are left, where data is missing due to
   preservation or the accessibility is was not given.

Zyg/Fe ratios of MSF 5B, MSF 23 and SMNS 13200

   Table S2 shows the calculated ratio in percent between the zygapophyses
   length and the femur length of the referred specimens. The ratios
   within on specimen and compared to each other specimen follow a
   determined scheme of zygapohyseal length explaining the wide range
   between 12.5 and 28.3%. With the help of the ratios we were able to
   define a new proxy for the determination of a range of femur lengths
   for the juvenile MSF 11.3. specimens.

Foil plan of bone field 11.3

   The foil plan shows the isolated neural arches found in bone field
   11.3. The neural arches are colored in green. The plan clearly shows
   that the neural arches were distributed over the whole area with no
   recognizable connection to each other and no centra lying next to them.
   The yardstick measures 1 m.

Specimen MSF 23 on exhibition in the MSF

   Specimen MSF 23 is a nearly complete and in most parts articulated P.
   engelhardti. The cervical vertebrae series is complete from C2 to C10.
   The dorsal series is complete from D1 to D15. The vertebrae of this
   specimen are heavily deformed, especially in the posterior dorsal
   series making measurements difficult. This specimen shows completely
   closed neurocentral sutures and all morphological characters are well
   developed. Scale bar measures 20 cm.

   extremely diminished in comparison to anterior dorsal neural arches.
   The articular surfaces of the prezygapophyses, postzygapophyses, and
   diapophyses display very rough articular surfaces once being covered by
   cartilage. Rough surfaces are an indicator of osteological immaturity.
