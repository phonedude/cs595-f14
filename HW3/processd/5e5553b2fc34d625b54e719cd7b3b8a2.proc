            2014 promises to be another hot year for startups creating
            tech for businesses rather than consumers.
            VCs are still tripping over themselves to fund enterprise
            startups and a slew of them are getting ready to go public
            this year.
            All of that is reason to consider a career with an enterprise
            startup that could make you rich on stock options.
            Plus, many of these startups are creating amazing, important
            new technologies and showering their employees with perks.
            With that in mind, we've compiled this list of buzzy
            enterprise startups destined to do well in 2014 and beyond »
