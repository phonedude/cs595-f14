Lidar landing with APM:Plane

   Over the last couple of days I have been testing the Lidar based
   auto-landing code that will be in the upcoming 3.1.1 release of
   APM:Plane. I'm delighted to say that it has gone very well!

   Testing has been done on two planes - one is a Meridian sports plane
   with a OS46 Nitro motor. That is a tricycle undercarriage, so has very
   easy ground steering. The tests today were with the larger VQ Porter
   2.7m tail-dragger with a DLE-35 petrol motor. That has a lot of
   equipment on board for the CanberraUAV OBC entry, so it weighs 14kg at
   takeoff making it a much more difficult plane to land well.

   The Lidar is a SF/02 from LightWare, a really nice laser rangefinder
   that works nicely with Pixhawk. It has a 40m range, which is great for
   landing, allowing the plane plenty of time to lock onto the glide slope
   in the landing approach.

   APM:Plane has supported these Lidars and other rangefinders for a
   while, but until now has not been able to use them for landing. Instead
   they were just being logged to the microSD card, but not actively used.
   After some very useful discussions with Paul Riseborough we now have
   the Lidar properly integrated into the landing code.

   The test flights today were an auto-takeoff (with automatic ground
   steering), a quick auto-circuit then an automatic landing. The first
   landing went long as I'd forgotten to drop THR_MIN down to zero (I
   normally have it at 20% to ensure the engine stays at a reasonable
   level during auto flight). After fixing that we got a series of good
   auto flights.

   The flight was flown with a 4 second flare time, which is probably a
   bit long as it allowed the plane to lose too much speed on the final
   part of the flare. That is why it bounces a bit as it starts losing
   height. I'll try with a bit shorter flare time tomorrow.

   Here is the video of one of the Meridian flights yesterday. Sorry for
   missing part of the flight, the video was shot with a cell phone by a
   friend at the field.

   Here is another video of the Porter flying today, but taken from the
   north of the runway

   I'd like to thank Charles Wannop from Flying Finish Productions for the
   video of the Porter today with help from Darrell Burkey.

          Blimey that's cool. Second story containing innovation from
          Australia ;-)

          A heartfelt thanks to Andrew and Darrell for the opportunity to
          shoot the session this morning :) Very exciting stuff.

          Charles.

          Wow, wonderful !

          LIDAR is quite expansive. Some times back I saw LIDAR module in
          just 45US$ on Kikstarter but I do not know the status of that
          wether it actually manufactured and delivered to customers or
          not.

          @Vishal,

          The folks at PulsedLight are working on a really affordable one
          that looks very promising.

          I tested an early prototype of it which had a range of about
          10m. The final version should be closer to 40m, which is ideal
          for landing.

          @Vishal, also, it isn't really expensive for what you get. The
          LightWare Lidars are really top quality and very reliable. If
          you are building a big plane then they are well worth the
          expense.

          I uploaded some still photos from this morning's test flights to
          the Canberra UAV Flickr site as well. Have a look to get a peek
          at all the cool things CUAV are up to these days.

          Congratulations!  Very cool stuff.

          Hi Andrew, thanks for clarification.

          Well done Andrew!

          Good to see you are using the Lightware Laser Rangefinders to
          benefit here!

          We now have 4 different plane types - from 5kg up to 66kg - all
          working well in auto takeof and autoland using those LRF's -
          they certainly have extended the envelope for this mode!

          Just an idea - we gave up on timed flares - the only way to make
          the autoland 'universal' is to ensure a controlled rate of
          descent - as the real pilots do...That way the flare is
          automatic, and lasts as long as it needs, in a closed loop
          control mode.

          Soft Landings.

          Regards

          Joe and Gisela.

          The Nampilot(s)!
