   "Trick Websites Dupe Democrats Into Donating To Republicans"

   The National Republican Congressional Committee has set up a number of
   websites that look like they could be a Democratic candidate’s campaign
   page, unless you read the fine print. They may even violate a Federal
   Election Commission regulation, Campaign Legal Center expert Paul S.
   Ryan explained to ThinkProgress.

   The NRCC has set up these pages for various congressional opponents,
   including Amanda Renteria (CA), Martha Roberston (NY), Kyrsten Sinema
   (AZ), Ann Kirkpatrick (AZ), Alex Sink (FL), and John Tierney (MA). Each
   follow a similar format; they list the candidate’s name “for Congress”
   to ask for donations:
   kirkpatrick
   Capture
   sinema

   According to Ryan, the websites appear to violate a Federal Election
   Commission regulation prohibiting political committees and parties from
   using a candidate’s name in special projects. The FEC considers
   websites, including microsites, a special project falling under this
   rule. The only exception is when the site makes it unambiguously clear
   it is opposed to the candidate. In Ryan’s opinion, the page set up
   under Tierney’s name “does not unambiguously show opposition to
   Tierney.” However, he noted, the FEC is “not a nimble organization” and
   it can take two years to complete an investigation, well past election
   day.

   Ray Bellamy of Florida says he was tricked by the page and accidentally
   made a donation to the NRCC. “It looked legitimate and had a smiling
   face of Sink and all the trappings of a legitimate site,” Bellamy told
   the Tampa Bay Times. The look-alike page uses the same colors as
   Florida candidate Alex Sink’s campaign, with the URL
   sinkforcongress2014.com. Once entering information, the person is
   redirected to an NRCC thank-you page.

   When a number of mock sites cropped up last month, the NRCC defended
   its actions as perfectly legal. In the meantime, the NRCC has agreed to
   return Bellamy’s donation.
