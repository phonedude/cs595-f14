Where More Americans Die at the Hands of Police

   Missouri looks like it's in the middle of the pack. But we desperately
   need better data.

   The death of 18-year-old Michael Brown at the hands of a Ferguson,
   Missouri, police officer has reintroduced police-related killings as a
   topic of major national debate. Brown is just the latest in a long line
   of young, unarmed black men killed by law enforcement agents.

   It's been widely reported that roughly 400 Americans die at the hands
   of police per year. And yet, that figure is likely a significant
   underestimate, as Reuben Fischer-Baum details at FiveThirtyEight.

   We ask a slightly different question: Where are Americans more likely
   to die at the hands of police or while under arrest?

   With the help of my colleagues Charlotta Mellander and Nick Lombardo of
   the Martin Prosperity Institute (MPI), we mapped data from two sources:
   “arrest related deaths” from the Department of Justice’s Bureau of
   Justice Statistics, and from the FBI’s annual Supplementary Homicide
   Report (SHR) on “felons killed by police.” We also got input from three
   leading American criminologists: Alfred Blumstein and Daniel Nagin, my
   former colleagues at Carnegie Mellon, and John Roman of the Urban
   Institute.

   It’s important to reiterate that both data sources suffer from serious
   deficiencies, not the least of which is under-reporting. Roman worries
   about "reporting bias," particularly the possibility that "more
   responsible agencies"—those least likely to use force in the first
   place—"are more likely to report, and less responsible agencies are
   less likely to report." But he also adds that what looks like missing
   data may not be. "It might be that few policing agencies have an
   officer-involved shooting and the agencies that don't simply don't
   report any data," he writes in an email.

   But, taken together and in light of their limits, the maps are broadly
   suggestive of the geography of U.S. police killings as well as the
   states where arrests are likely to result in more deaths. As Roman puts
   it: "It is important to shine a light on the subject. Because there is
   such limited data, our ability to define the scope of the
   problem greatly limits our ability to form an appropriate response."

   The Geography of Arrest-Related Death
   Bureau of Justice Statistics

   We start with the BJS data on arrest-related deaths. Nearly 5,000
   (4,813) arrest-related deaths were reported between 2003 and 2009.
   These contain everyone who died in the custody of law enforcement
   officials, including suicides, deaths from intoxication and accidents.
   Homicides by police accounted for roughly six in ten of all
   arrest-related deaths between 2003 and 2009, as the chart to the left
   shows, and ranged from a low of around 55 percent in 2005 to a high of
   68 percent in 2009. BJS also cautions “Data are more representative of
   the nature of arrest-related deaths than the volume at which they
   occur.”

   The first map charts all arrest-related deaths throughout the
   country. The BJS data cover 2003 through 2009, from which we calculated
   the average annual amount for those periods.
   Martin Prosperity Institute

   As the map shows, California, Texas and Florida – all big states – had
   the largest average numbers of arrest-related deaths per year, with
   111, 99, and 75 respectively. New York (38), Arizona (34), Pennsylvania
   (31), and Illinois (30) also had significant numbers of arrest-related
   deaths. Missouri, where Michael Brown was killed, falls in the second
   lowest quintile, with an average of 4 arrest-related deaths annually.

   The next map charts average annual arrest-related deaths per million
   state residents, to control for population size.
   Martin Prosperity Institute

   These range from a high of 6.5 deaths per million people to a low of
   0.27. Some states, in other words, have nearly twenty times the number
   of deaths than others. At the top end of the scale is the District of
   Columbia, which we note as usual is an outlier because it is 100
   percent urban, as opposed to states.

   Leaving the District aside, Arizona leads with 5.2 deaths per million,
   followed by New Mexico (4.1 deaths per 1 million), Florida (3.9 deaths)
   and Texas (3.9 deaths). Note the broad swath of dark red running across
   the Southwest. The West Coast follows closely behind, with Utah (3.5
   deaths), California (2.9 deaths) and Oregon (2.8 deaths).

   Northeastern states have relatively low levels of arrest-related
   deaths. New York has just 1.9 deaths per million residents, and New
   Jersey is even lower, with 1.3 deaths. Massachusetts is among the
   states with the lowest arrest-related deaths, at 0.9.

   A few Southern states have low rates as well. Arkansas had 0.4 deaths
   per one million residents; Georgia had 0.27. And Missouri posted one of
   the lowest arrest-related rates in the nation, at 0.6 per million.

   The Geography of Felons Killed by Police

   The second set of maps cover felons killed by police. These data are
   from the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports for 2012, the most recent year
   available. These figures, too, are problematic. The FBI’s data is
   self-reported and not all police departments participate in the
   reporting process. The data only capture the deaths of those who were
   convicted of or were in the process of carrying out a felony.
   Furthermore, as Fischer-Baum points out, "unjustifiable homicide by
   police" is not a classification, so deaths like that of Michael Brown
   might not be counted. Also, a number of states – New York, for instance
   – have zeroes entered, suggesting there are missing values and serious
   under-reporting.
   Martin Prosperity Institute

   The third map, above, charts the total number of felons killed by
   police by state in 2012. Again, the Southwest and West Coast have the
   highest levels of police killings. California tops the list with 114,
   followed by Texas (54), Pennsylvania (29), Arizona (27) and Georgia
   (20). Missouri falls into the upper band of states, with 11 police
   killings of felons, below New Jersey (13) and above Michigan (10).

   The fourth map, below, shows the number of felons killed by police per
   one million people, again controlling for population. Once again,
   Southwestern states have the largest concentrations. Arizona leads with
   4.2 deaths per million, followed by Maryland (3.3), California (3.0)
   and Nevada (2.9).

   On the opposite end of the spectrum, there are low concentrations
   throughout the Upper Great Lakes. The states with the least killings
   per one million residents were Ohio (0.3), Connecticut (0.3),
   Mississippi (0.3) and Utah (0.4).  Missouri, with 1.8 felons killed by
   police per million people, again falls in the middle of the pack.
   Martin Prosperity Institute

                 •       •       •       •       •

   There are similarities and differences between the two sets of maps.
   The Southwest and West Coast have relatively high values according to
   both measures. Conversely, Mississippi, Minnesota, and Kentucky have
   relatively low levels of both.

   Still, differences persist. The Sunbelt, which fares far worse on
   arrest-related deaths, does not have nearly the same level of police
   killings of felons. The Northeast does better on arrest-related deaths
   than police killings, with Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Vermont all
   scoring higher on the rate of felons killed by police. There is a
   particularly drastic change that occurs between the two maps in the
   Deep South and lower Midwest. Missouri, Tennessee, and Georgia have low
   levels of arrest related deaths per million, but rise to the top on
   felons killed by police.

                 •       •       •       •       •

   The divergences on these maps highlight the need for better data on
   people killed by police. Knowing how many Americans are killed by
   police officers is important far beyond the outcry over the case of
   Michael Brown. A 2003 American Journal of Public Health study notes
   that the perception that someone was killed by police officers or by
   government agents has been the spark for “almost every major civil
   insurrection that has occurred in the United States in the past
   century.” Such incidents can and often do precipitate even more
   injuries and deaths, and cost their communities dearly, both
   economically and socially. When people no longer trust the police to
   handle things nonviolently, the study further points out, they are much
   less likely to cooperate with them or even to report crime at all. "The
   ability to accurately assess the incidence and characteristics of
   justifiable homicides committed by police officers is central to the
   development and evaluation of policies that promote public health and
   safety," the report concludes.

   Meanwhile, some journalists are trying to fill in the gaps in data on
   their own. At Deadspin, writers are crowdsourcing data collection by
   asking readers to use Google’s search tools to find and submit shooting
   deaths via a special public submission form.

   The bottom line: We need complete and transparent data on Americans who
   die in the custody or at the hands of police. Crime data is notoriously
   problematic, with under-reporting a common occurrence. But we are
   talking about people dying while under arrest or at the hands of police
   – very different from a random, simple, nonviolent crime, like somebody
   stealing a bicycle. The prospect of the state killing its own people is
   a very serious one. And the U.S. must mandate reporting of all such
   incidents, collecting and publishing detailed accounts of how, why and
   when these killings have occurred.

   Only when we have that information can we even begin to pinpoint the
   problems within our justice system – and to begin the process of fixing
   them.
