Free Law Innovation Fellowship - Civic Hacking ...

   If you're a developer who wants to make a difference at the community
   level, lower the barriers to public access to government data, and work
   in a no-drama, innovative government office for a year, consider
   applying to be the first-ever Free Law Innovation Fellow ("Innovation
   Fellow").
   The Innovation Fellow is a civic-hacker-in-residence, a full-time
   developer, shipping innovative open-source tools to improve internal
   processes and enhance government transparency, working directly in the
   Council of the District of Columbia's Office of General Counsel. (Think
   Presidential Innovation Fellow and Code For America Fellow, but focused
   on law and internal operations at the state/local level.)
   The Innovation Fellow is a problem solver, working side-by-side with
   practicing government lawyers, with a range of technical experience and
   passion for public service. No prior legal experience is necessary,
   though a demonstrated ability to internalize complicated systems is
   essential. Most important, though, is the ability to prototype, test,
   and ship mature code.
   The Council has recently been at the forefront of government legal tech
   innovation—working with local groups such as the DC Legal Hackers and
   Code for DC—and the General Counsel is himself a civic hacker. In the
   coming year, the Innovation Fellow will be responsible for continuing
   the progress, and taking innovation and systems-improvement to the next
   level.
   The Innovation Fellow will have significant flexibility in terms of
   tools and design patterns. Python, Ruby, Node, Heroku, AWS, SQL, NoSQL,
   etc., are all on the table. But the Innovation Fellow will need to feel
   comfortable developing collaboratively, in the open, with open-source
   software. And the Innovation Fellow should be prepared to document his
   or her experiences, through blogs and talks at local meetups.
   The Innovation Fellow does not need to be a District of Columbia
   resident, but will need to work side-by-side with lawyers at the
   Council office at the John A. Wilson Building, near Metro Center.
