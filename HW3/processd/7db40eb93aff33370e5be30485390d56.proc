All Our Patent Are Belong To You

   By Elon Musk, CEO
   TAGS: Customers / Model S /
   [icn_discussion_14.gif] 503 comments

   Yesterday, there was a wall of Tesla patents in the lobby of our Palo
   Alto headquarters. That is no longer the case. They have been removed,
   in the spirit of the open source movement, for the advancement of
   electric vehicle technology.

   Tesla Motors was created to accelerate the advent of sustainable
   transport. If we clear a path to the creation of compelling electric
   vehicles, but then lay intellectual property landmines behind us to
   inhibit others, we are acting in a manner contrary to that goal. Tesla
   will not initiate patent lawsuits against anyone who, in good faith,
   wants to use our technology.

   When I started out with my first company, Zip2, I thought patents were
   a good thing and worked hard to obtain them. And maybe they were good
   long ago, but too often these days they serve merely to stifle
   progress, entrench the positions of giant corporations and enrich those
   in the legal profession, rather than the actual inventors. After Zip2,
   when I realized that receiving a patent really just meant that you
   bought a lottery ticket to a lawsuit, I avoided them whenever possible.

   At Tesla, however, we felt compelled to create patents out of concern
   that the big car companies would copy our technology and then use their
   massive manufacturing, sales and marketing power to overwhelm Tesla. We
   couldn’t have been more wrong. The unfortunate reality is the opposite:
   electric car programs (or programs for any vehicle that doesn’t burn
   hydrocarbons) at the major manufacturers are small to non-existent,
   constituting an average of far less than 1% of their total vehicle
   sales.

   At best, the large automakers are producing electric cars with limited
   range in limited volume. Some produce no zero emission cars at all.

   Given that annual new vehicle production is approaching 100 million per
   year and the global fleet is approximately 2 billion cars, it is
   impossible for Tesla to build electric cars fast enough to address the
   carbon crisis. By the same token, it means the market is enormous. Our
   true competition is not the small trickle of non-Tesla electric cars
   being produced, but rather the enormous flood of gasoline cars pouring
   out of the world’s factories every day.

   We believe that Tesla, other companies making electric cars, and the
   world would all benefit from a common, rapidly-evolving technology
   platform.

   Technology leadership is not defined by patents, which history has
   repeatedly shown to be small protection indeed against a determined
   competitor, but rather by the ability of a company to attract and
   motivate the world’s most talented engineers. We believe that applying
   the open source philosophy to our patents will strengthen rather than
   diminish Tesla’s position in this regard.

   I consider this great news, but considered Tesla's patents defensive,
   not offensive, to begin with.

   Thanks for doing good. Nobody else has any excuses now.

   As a stockholder and a Model S owner, but mostly as a temporary
   resident of a threatened planet, I highly approve and am cautiously
   optimistic that this move will accelerate the cause of electrifying
   transportation.

   Bold move indeed! I hope this inspires other startups to get in the
   game and pick up the slack from existing manufacturers who refuse to
   accept that the EV revolution is already taking place.

   I don't understand the headline, but I understand the spirit. A more
   robust EV segment can only help everyone with skin in the game. This is
   a rare situation where rivals can do much better if they share
   technology and take advantage of shared experience and buying power.
   But this begs a big question: If Tesla is supply-constrained right down
   to the batteries, and needs a massive new factory just to keep its head
   afloat, how could any rival leapfrog Tesla even if it has the
   "blueprints" to do so? Where would it get the goods? I don't see any
   significant change to the automotive landscape coming anytime soon,
   patents or no patents. But I do see yet another PR boost for Tesla
   here.

   As a Tesla owner, I'm excited by what appears to be genuine concern for
   the well-being of the planet. As a shareholder, I'm not so sure.
   However, I am ready to be proven wrong once again by Elon. Elon, you
   are the man.

   THIS IS ~*AWESOME*~!!!

   A lot of people will disagree. I don't care.

   Thank you, Elon! I was hoping very much that you had noticed that the
   other auto manufacturers have no intent whatsoever to create viable
   electric cars. Everything they do is meant to perpetuate the myth that
   petroleum products will last forever.

   By opening up the patents, anyone else who has the inkling to build
   from the ground up as a supplier of EVs can do so without having to
   reinvent the wheel. By empowering others to follow the same path as you
   have, the traditional ICE industry may be accosted from multiple sides.

   Further, those companies who have only dabbled in low volume hybrid
   electric supercars may now decide to investigate the possibility of
   making fully electric versions instead.

   Just a mind seeing into the future, can do this. Car makers only think

   It is a reference to a famous line in a videogame called 'ZERO WING' on

   I really hope other car manufacturers don't try to screw Tesla over by
   twisting the technology under their patents and shove it away in the
   dark (seen plenty of ideas go non existent involving alternate power
   sources for vehicles).

   But on a good note, Tesla is one of the best companies I've seen with
   the most promising electric vehicle... I would definitely buy one later
   on.

   This is a testimony to Tesla's commitment to its mission. People don't

   To own a Tesla is an unrealized dream, though I believe it will someday
   happen. My husband makes fun of the way I choose companies to invest
   in, based on the companies' actions and leadership, with the few
   retirement funds I have. I couldn't feel more satisfied with my
   decision to invest in Tesla. I believe in you, Elon Musk, your heart
   and your mind! Thank you!!!

   I applaud your efforts Elon! We need more people like you in the world!
   I know you hear it all the time, but you're an inspiration!

   Also, Elon, take care of your health, as I saw you recently and you've
   gained a significant amount of weight and were looking quite drained.
   I'm saying this purely out of concern, not malice, as I don't want you
   to completely burn out and have no time to eat well and exercise
   because you're spp busy trying to change the world! Also take the time
   for your well-being.

   Take care Elon!

   Best Wishes,

   This is beyond outstanding! Well done Tesla! This won't make as big a
   splash in the media as it deserves to and few people will understand
   how important this decision is. This is so opposite the offensive
   patent strategy executed by companies like Apple and I dare say Tesla
   holds far more useful and world changing proprietary tech.

   The spirit is highly commendable, and as habitants of this planet - and
   coincidental timing with @neiltyson #Cosmos finale - we all should be
   seriously concerned about emissions. When someone as intelligent as
   Elon Musk & Neil deGrasse Tyson say stuff like "we need to pay
   attention to this stuff", the world needs to pay attention.

   The attorneys probably gasped out loud when their CEO said "we're doing
   this", and shareholders are probably biting their lips, but the guy is
   stating repeatedly getting to Mars is key for species survival...it
   doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out the urgency and
   importance to getting away from fossil fuel vehicles ASAP.

   The gesture and implication for not enforcing held patents to better
   encourage innovation and R&D, should earn Elon Musk not Man of the
   Year, but Man of the Century consideration. Or maybe Earth's MVP award
   equivalent. Seriously.

   I've said it before and I'll say it again - Elon Musk is my hero,
   perhaps the most selfless billionaire in a world where too many are
   concerned exclusively with their own greedy self interests.

   Does this open Tesla to some risks they didn't already face? Perhaps.
   But having the right to build something, and having the ability to
   execute, are two different things. My faith remains with Elon and the
   exceptional team he has assembled.

   The competition may win my business someday, but what a world it will
   be when others can build a car better than my Model S.

   Great! You're so far ahead of their engineers' sort of thinking that
   you can keep your advantages for quite some time. To that end, isn't it
   time to redesign the Model S and provide some new cars on the same
   template (though not precisely the same look)? For example, a 4 seater
   luxury coupe, a 2+2 seater sports car (a la Aston Martin just plonked
   on the Model S base with 400bhp motor), a 2 seater sports car, an
   XC90-esque rear wheel drive station wagon, all with the same motor and
   battery and everything else, just changed bodywork. If you had a proper
   cooling solution to the motor you can probably get 500-600bhp out of it
   reliably (at least in short bursts).

   We will wait for the Chinese to copy the car soon.
   Maybe. And they do NOT need the same gross margin (and Chinese import
   tariff) since they are not concerned with development of the next
   generation or model E. I do not agree with Elon this time! He must to
   what is in the shareholders interest as a CEO. He could easily have
   made money to development by selling or licensing their tech very
   cheap. This may be the first time I disagree with him. Too bad !!

   Elon and Nikola appears to have much in common. Nikola made the world
   leap forward with his inventions, looks like Elon is trying to do the
   same and this is truly a good way to do it. There is no doubt Nikola is
   an inspiration in more than one way in this company. I have a feeling
   investors will keep this company up and running for a very long time
   even if its not an investment that will earn them the most money. Some
   things are more important than £&$

   Now please go back to building my car and stay away from the birds!

   Very impressive move, it speaks volumes of Tesla confidence. I'm also
   certain it will pay off for Tesla, it's employees, the auto industry
   and planet earth/humanity at large. With more manufacturers in the
   electric vehicle industry, we may see faster adoption and acceptance
   rates, which will translate into faster growth for Tesla and the
   reduction of CO2.

   This is fantastic, if nothing else than for spite! During the Great
   White Flight post WW2 GM and other major manufacturers bought mass
   transit patents to force people into buying cars when not needed. Your
   making them free for anyone will be a huge and necessary blow to their
   antiquated industry where they stifle competition.

   I used to be a car salesman, did it for four years but I was always
   cynical in their approach. It seems like now they've met their match in
   terms of ingenuity. In the 70s when Honda and Toyota were breaking into
   the market they lobbied for import taxes and produced a shitty product
   because they could. Good luck now, "Big 3"

   Patents are more or less worthless now anyway. When Apple can get a

   waste resources to defend patents....

   On a different note , Elon , are you considering new battery technology
   like power japan plus dual carbon batteries to power your future
   electric cars ?

   Tesla will continue to draw top talent, out innovate, and make great
   products. That's what matters, not patents. But I have to wonder, how
   could this move be abused? Could another car maker (start-up or big
   player) reverse engineer the Tesla charging port and have their cars
   start using the supercharger network for free?

   If Tesla wants to stop them, now they can't use patents to do it. This
   rogue 3rd party could just claim "in good faith we want to use Tesla
   technology to advance EVs". Maybe Tesla would not want to stop them,
   but then would Tesla keep building supercharger locations if they were
   being used be non-Tesla cars? And how would Tesla drivers feel if they
   had to wait in line to get access.

   This has to be considered on a worldwide scale, would it happen in
   China, US, UK...? Arguably, in some markets, patents wouldn't help them
   protect against this much anyway. Something to consider.

   This is absolutely great! Keep up the fantastic work! I just wanted to
   leave a comment to show that although I don't own a TESLA (yet) I still
   pay attention to great work this company is doing.

   I hope every employee there knows what an awesome job they're doing by
   revolutionizing the automotive industry, not giving into UAW pressure,
   and taking on the unfair selling practices that dealers have created.

   I believe TESLA will go down in history for all its done, and when our
   children's children look back at this time for innovation the word
   TESLA will not only be in their science books but also in their history
   books as well.

   Can someone please fix this embarrassing blog title, or did I miss
   something when I took English class all those years in school?

   Amazing. Nice to see companies actually doing things to make the world
   better instead of worrying about only increasing their profits.

   This is eerie, but reflective of the synchronicity that is flooding the
   minds of the masses of people.

   As I was driving yesterday, I thought to myself "If I'm ever fortunate
   enough to purchase a Tesla, I do my best to promote its engineering
   feats to whomever I encounter. I would also do whatever I could to
   encourage Mr. Musk to consider release the patents to world. He is
   doing wonderful work but needs help to achieve his and the honorable
   Nikola Tesla's vision."

   I shouldn't be surprised that EM and Tesla Motors are right on par with
   the ultimate vision of Mr. Tesla. I used to work at an oil company and
   I've seen how much money changes hands from these tycoons on a daily
   basis - so I'm sure you know you're in for a war. You have a soldier in
   me waiting for a fight.

   I suggest getting with Sergio Marccione of FCA and talk to him about
   reworking the Fiat 500e. There's no reason he should be losing $14K per

   for the record "All Our Patent Are Belong To You"

   is a very interesting call back to an old internet/arcade/tech
   punchline:

   ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO US

   I recognized it instantly, but i can't imagine that it is a widely
   understood title/wording choice.

   Elon and team are legendary , this is why I love this guy! He will be
   heralded if he's not already as a true innovator and inspiration on the
   level of the Tesla himself. This world would be so much better if it
   was about the legacy you left on the world before you pass and not how
   much digits are seen at your bank, think about it. For an entrepreneur
   as myself (Red Piston) it has shaped the way I think going forward in
   terms how making great things that truly help people.

   This, this right here is why I support your company in almost every
   aspect. It's so hard to find a truly "Good" company that really
   promotes a "Good" message. In today's world this is almost un-heard of
   and this is why If I had the money to support your ideas and hard work
   put forth into the Tesla I'd sell my current car in a heartbeat and buy
   one of yours.. but not because it's new and "Fancy" but for the fact
   that the way this company is ran from the outside looking in is
   flawless. Thank you Tesla for everything I really hope this creates a
   spark in today's everyday life and way of business. Please continue to
   bring the future!

   ALL OF YOUR PATENTS BELONGS TO ME.
   Seriously.. THANK YOU.

   My designs for electric flying motorcycles and e-flying bicycles are in
   the public domain, but need help and support in bringing them to
   market. The first 10,000 feet of air space is the most under utilized
   natural resource on the planet. Multi-modal electric personal air
   vehicles (e-PAVs) are technically plausible today. Transferring 10 to
   30 percent of the surface traffic volume into a computer based and
   controlled airspace will go a long way in relieving traffic congestion
   and carbon dependency, and achieving the safest possible transport
   environment. Some designs are not on the web site
   www.flyingmotorcyclecompany.com. I reaching out to you Elon.

   Seems like a cool move. But I am confused by the motivation of the
   whole movement towards open source in this case. What's said makes
   sense. But why buy a TSLA in the future when there are others
   available? How does this impact the future business model and
   profitability of TSLA? Perhaps other auto makers are not able to enter
   into the electric market due to lack of R&D funding the resources or
   simply operationally constricted to do anything beyond what they are
   currently doing - tweaking things here and there and call it a "new
   model." If that's the case, then open source may not promote the wide
   adoption that's hoped. As an investor, I wonder if at all this would
   impact TSLA stock pricing.

   The competition is screwed. If they don't use the patents they will lag

   I'm not going to be able to apply this public domain information to
   better our world in the way that Tesla is doing by producing
   carbon-free cars, but I will do what I can to expand the spirit of this
   magnanimous gesture.

   One thing is clear, Elon: You are out-competing the traditional OEM
   industry by competing at a much higher level in product, marketing, and
   strategic philosophy. Most people are behind you 100%, and can't wait
   to jump the Hydrocarbon/franchised dealer/excess production prison

   quite beautiful. My father was the best human being on earth. He would
   be so proud that his daughter is such a strong supporter of such a

   true purpose of Tesla even more. Stay strong Mr. Musk. We need you.
   Thank goodness you chose to come to America. You make people proud to
   be a part of Tesla, no matter how small that part may be. Tesla is the
   best company in history. It is by far the best car built in history.

   After having left the Marine Corps, about 30 year ago, I saw the movie,

   gesture Anthony Quinn-playing the Pope,selling assets of the Church in
   order to feed needy people, though fictitious cause me to well up with
   emotion and tears. This move is conceptually similar to what you have
   done with Tesla's patents-good job Mr. Musk! I am proud to own the

   and then take a better design and make even more cash or suppress the
   technology for your Saudi lithium lords . Do us a favor and keep your
   patents and money. Your only helping the Saudi's who have invested
   greatly in lithium sourcing and the high capacity battery market. No,
   we the silent ones who hide from the corporate energy monsters will not
   help you. We will wait silently for humanity to pull it's head out of

   I love the idea of opening up the technology for other companies to
   make use of in their own products and services. Throughout history
   there have been knowledge and/or technology graciously given to
   mankind, that caused an explosion of industry and innovation. Time will
   only tell if this is one of those events.

   I like the idea of non-motor companies making use of this technology,
   like companies that are in the business of only making charging
   stations. From what I have read the charging station adapters range
   from continent to continent, making the adoption of electric cars
   harder. An open standard for this would be beneficial to all.

   Will (or is it already) this information be readily available for all
   to read and discover in a centre place? like

   Wait, since your company benefited and grew from large government loans

   transportation of petroleum fuel burns much more energy than clean
   electric power, not to mention subsidies -- what's your point again,

   karlasing@gmail.com: Solar, water, wind, yes- coal; a variety of
   methods. He merely solved a link in the chain of problems. Which is a
   massive and impactful step. Also, GM and the car co.'s benefited even
   MORE from government subsidizing, that were much, much larger. Nice
   try.

   Elon, thanks for filling the visionary shoes that are few these days. I

   other than people being afraid of change and jealous of success that
   which they haven't achieved themselves.

   "I realized that receiving a patent really just meant that you bought a
   lottery ticket to a lawsuit..." I love how you so concisely speak the
   truth in this case. Does "opening" your patents mean that you will be
   licensing the rights to them, more or less routinely, as long as the
   licensees operate in good faith? Although there has been an indecent
   amount of patent trolling over the past several decades, Silicon Valley
   long ago figured out that liberal licensing and cross-licensing of
   patents could keep innovation flowing vigorously, while preventing the
   kind of abuse you were worried the big automakers would practice
   against Tesla.

   Or is it that you won't even bother with the formality of licensing the
   use of your patents, basically putting the intellectual property into
   the public domain? Is there anywhere I can find the details of the
   arrangement you propose?

   I hope your new direction works out well, and is not the first step
   toward shutting down Tesla as a car maker in its own right (by planting
   seeds for a thousand flowers to bloom in replacement). I have been a
   Tesla fan since the many years, during which the Roadster was accused
   of being vaporware. I knew Tesla would make it happen, and I look
   forward with patience and enthusiasm to the affordable model, to arrive
   someday soon. If I can afford a Model-S before then, so much the
   better! I think the world needs Tesla, to show the way and set a high
   standard. Thanks for everything so far, and best of luck in all future
   endeavors.

   @Robert Fahey - The blog post title is a pun that references a bad
   translation from the old video game Zero Wing. At one point a phrase is
   translated from Japanese to English as "All your base are belong to
   us." It's a weirdly popular internet meme.

   In any case, this is some pretty amazing news and I'm glad that this
   has happened. Maybe someday there will be some GPL source for the
   computer systems that the vehicles run. I can always hope, as I'd love
   to pour through it and look for ways to improve it or make it more

   I wonder if this opens the door to making the Tesla charge plug an
   industry standard? It is far superior to the J1772, CHAdeMO and the SAE
   Frankenplug and could replace all three on future EVs and chargers. It
   could also mean the end of charge stations that can only charge one
   brand of car.

   This is so inspiring and will go down in history as one of the seminal

   I ordered a Tesla a couple of weeks ago and I just sent a copy of my

   Intellectual Property is makes good business sense, not to mention good
   sense to advance innovation and the global economy!

   generating power at the moment comes at great expense, mostly into the
   pockets of bankers.. this must change first.. the rest will follow..
   basically free power would change the world in ways you can only

   Great news from Tesla indeed, for different reasons though. I
   congratulate Mr. Musk for being a visionary who understands the need of
   a future replacement of petrol based car industry. By releasing patents
   to the public Tesla helps others to enter EV car market or boost their
   existing projects thus creating bigger and stronger e-car market. This
   combined with the growing network of charging stations along with the
   planned 5-billion US $ battery plant project will give Tesla
   substantial advantage. Electricity storage continues to be the biggest
   challenge to overcome in e-cars and whoever rules the battery market
   innovations and their mass volume production will hugely benefit from
   the EV boom in the future. Moreover, I think this may be the beginning,
   which will lead to the transformation of Tesla from a miniscule car
   manufacturer into a global player in the car battery market and
   charging stations services. Good luck.

   To those making excuses re: the title of this blog:

   Not everyone who wants/does own a Tesla vehicle is up on old sci-fi
   references.

   For the CEO of a huge company to make a reference like that and just
   assume we would all know what he was talking about was a bad choice. My
   first reaction was not, "haha, that's funny." It was, rather, "doesn't
   the CEO of a multi-million dollar corporation have someone to proofread
   his blog?

   I get it now; haha. You could have made it the subtitle, put it in
   quotes, or even directly referenced it. Instead, you lost me as a fan.

   Can someone please voice their thoughts on how they think this will
   affect the success of Tesla as a company? There is no doubt that this
   move is good for the world, but what about Tesla and its shareholders?
   I went all in for TSLA and there are many others that have as well. And
   as much as I admire Elon for his love for the planet, this move seems a
   bit kamikaze. Just like those Japanese pilots that dove head-first into
   an enemy base in order to win a war for a cause. Tesla is essentially
   giving out whatever advantage it has over its competitors, most of whom
   have more money and clout than Tesla. Elon's response on this seems to
   be that the consumer market for cars is large enough which makes him to
   seem content with a smaller piece of the pie. That is all admirable.
   But what about TSLA's shareholders??!! Am I the only one having these
   thoughts and concerns?? We are the ones who invested our money and it
   seems we are the least regarded in this decision.

   This is not a hate message. In fact, I admire Elon so much that I have
   watched almost every youtube video there is on him. There is nothing to
   dislike about the guy. But I wish I can gain his thoughts on how this
   will affect TSLA stockholders.

   Well that's indeed a great new stance analogous to hybrid patent
   programming. However, while not referring to the literal connotation to
   the following statement of Elon "...lay intellectual property landmines
   behind us to inhibit others...", but to the symbolic connotation
   therefor landmines in certain real-time scenarios may serve as great
   food for thought to as a matter of fact detect, analyze and carefully
   select white spaces/gaps in existing systems or solutions to detect
   likelihood of design and implementation of at least one of new and
   enhanced systems or solutions...which is in conformance to your
   statement "...in good faith..." Eventually, on a lighter note, I see
   Tesla having filed and/or granted approx. 500 patent apps/patents in a
   span of 4 yrs 2009 till date. Hats off to thee!!

   This is inspiring news. Thank you, Elon.

   What's unfortunate is the lack of leadership coming from the rest of
   the industry. If we are to transition to a more sustainable future,
   we're going to need a vision or "pull" like Tesla is offering but I
   also think we're going to need a "push". The auto-sector isn't evolving
   because the market is mostly complacent. We're content with yesterday's
   solutions. If we are to transition to sustainable transport, we're
   going to need to feel a little less comfortable with the status quo.

   I'm a lawyer that runs a small climate change not-for-profit in Canada
   that's working on just that. I'm lobbying cities to pass laws that
   would require climate change warning labels on gas pumps. The idea is
   to help people connect the dots to an otherwise abstract, faraway
   problem. The act of going to a gas station and filling up a car has
   been normalized for several generations. The warning labels take this
   unexamined act and problematize it. In creating a sense of
   dissatisfaction with the prevailing mobility solution, they stimulate
   demand for alternatives. Please watch my TEDx to learn more:
   http://ourhorizon.org/TEDx

   @paul@permanenti...

   There is a change in the market occurring. It is a slow change, but
   people (traditionally called consumers by economists) are becoming more
   aware of the bigger picture when they buy a product. e.g. does my money
   go to a good cause when I buy this, is the company direction something
   I agree with, is the company doing good things for humanity etc.
   Sharing knowledge is the next step in Tesla's journey to creating
   positive answers to these types of questions, not to mention the very
   specific benefits that well supported open source projects benefit from
   (Tesla I'm sure already receives many unsolicited suggestions for
   improving their product/knowledge, this will only increase now).

   Reading comments from other people on this blog should tell you that
   Elon/Tesla is on to something here and shareholders need not be
   concerned. More people will now want to buy and own a Tesla.

   Interesting announcement.

   Does this mean that Tesla will incorporate other car makers' patented
   technology into its cars? It would be great if the Model S was
   available with features like Mercedes Benz's Distronic Plus and Driver
   Assistance Packages.

   As innovative as the car is, it does not match some more established
   car makers' active safety and convenience features. Now that patents
   are not a problem, I hope Tesla can catch up in this area.

   bknabe

   Unfortunately, Tesla can only open source their own patents. Other car

   - and much of that would probably have to be re-engineered to make it
   more energy efficient.

   Dear Elon Musk,

   In 1925 General Electric made the pioneering work of Rice & Kellogg on
   the pistonic paper cone loudspeaker we know today generally available
   and free of patent encumbrances. These loudspeakers sounded fabulous
   and were perfect for Radios, but were inefficient and needed
   electricity connected to the home to be viable. This was great for GE
   who wanted to sell light bulbs and appliances – they were banned from
   selling electricity due to antitrust concerns - and Radios in the home
   were the key to persuading homeowners to connect up which was a
   prerequisite for electric appliances.

   In my view the lack of competition led to the complete lack of
   innovation in the loudspeaker industry which has persisted for nearly
   100 years!

   There are counter examples in the early semiconductor industry and I
   clearly don’t have the full facts with access to Tesla Motor’s internal
   information but Tesla should think carefully about making its electric
   vehicle IP generally available to spur adoption of electric energy for
   transportation. It may have the opposite effect that is sought! But
   maybe Tesla’s goal is the pure play energy business in which case –
   good move. Maybe!

   advise Elon to modify this blog entry slightly : We won't go after you,
   if you don't go after us. Tesla is indicating that it's using it's
   patent portfolio for defensive purposes only. As such, your patents
   lose defensive value if you're stating that you will not assert them at
   all, even in a counter claim after being sued.

   Hopefully this will have the desired affect of fostering innovation in
   electric vehicles.

   Question: I understand the intent behind this move, but what is to stop
   the big players (GM, Ford, Chrysler) from co-opting the technology then
   using it to "corner" Tesla by suing it for exclusive rights to the
   technology? It is no secret that the old guard and those who sell every
   day cars are threatened.

   I am not sold on the benefits of electric vs. conventional gasoline
   cars, but I give Mr. Musk major props for being innovative, challenging
   the status quo, and taking big risks in the hopes that something better
   can be made. That said, I'd buy a Tesla if I could afford it.

   all I truly wish to do is thank you from the bottom of my heart.

   I look forward to driving my Tesla and I am happy to be a shareholder,
   but most importantly I am honored to witness a CEO of a company that
   has put his dreams, our planet and his company at the forefront and
   trusts that the world can and will be a better place because of it.

   Thank You Mr. Musk!

   Elon you have given us hope.

   I was watching the Cosmos episode that talked about global warming and
   could not help but feel a sense of utter and complete hopelessness for
   Earth and mankind. It was depressing to think how many of us live for
   the short-term and don't care about long-term consequences of our
   actions. "I'm going to die in roughly 60-70 years so why do I care? I'm
   going to make my life as grand and comfortable as can be while I'm
   here. Screw the future, I'm not going to be in it" type of attitude.

   Even if this does change the world for the better, you have a lot of
   rich people invested fossil fuels and every business related to it that
   will do everything in their power to keep their riches from being eaten
   up by an electric revolution. If they can't make it impossible, they
   will damn well sure make it is a slow process. They are our biggest
   roadblock and need to be removed. Tesla's gesture is a much needed
   boost, but unfortunately it may already be too late. I hope that many
   companies, governments, and individuals are inspired by you.

   Wow, what a lot of comments. Now for mine. I hope someone else did not
   already say what I am about to say, but here it is. Tesla still needs
   to and will continue to file patent applications as they continue to
   innovate. In the age we live in, other manufacturers might try to hurt
   Tesla by claiming first dibs on technology that Tesla developed. The
   point is that it ends up open source, and this may well accelerate
   innovation in the future, since other companies are allowed to use the
   technology and possibly improve upon it. Patent ownership is overrated
   in nearly every way except protecting yourself from other companies
   suing you (like one well known mobile device manufacturer that has
   repeatedly tried to stop another from selling...)

   Tesla is redefining what "giving back to the society" really meant. I
   always liked Tesla Motors since I learned about it. I always supported
   their approach while some people around criticized that Tesla's only
   meant to cater cars for luxury segment. What many don't understand is
   that the Model S and Model X were just huge+risky efforts to create a
   brand amongst the automotive mass markets. Once they found their foot
   and created identity for themselves, they now plan to enter into the
   market with an economic model that can cater to the masses. And they
   are looking to share their technologies and supercharging stations in
   order to create a standardized network for other automotive companies.
   They are not afraid that other organizations would just exploit such a
   situation but rather are afraid of only one thing - ENVIRONMENT. I hope
   the industry as a whole would join hands to strengthen such efforts
   from Tesla moving forward into the future.

   I can't help but want to play my part. If there is anything I can do as
   a consumer or as a competent individual please let me and, by
   extension, the collective masses, that believe in your work, know.
   For the longest time I suspected you would be hard pressed to do wrong,
   now I know it's true. Right now in my mind (and I hate gushing like

   I stopped believing in patents many years ago. They are only useful if
   a company has deep pockets, plus most products are based on innovation,
   not invention. It is interesting that Elon came to similar conclusions.
   He misses one point. Companies are required to include drawings and
   descriptions when filing for a patent so that the information enters
   the public domain and others can build on it. I wonder if that's the
   real reason he will no longer pursue patents. This actually allows
   Tesla Motors to be more secretive if they so choose.

   "Could you patent the sun?" Jonas Salk's famous words haunted me after
   reading this press release. You have given the world of engineering
   something equal to when Salk gave the polio vaccination to the world.
   Despite the possibility of other reasons as might be defined and
   debated later, it makes no matter (see included website). This is one
   profound leap for our generation.

   Thank you Elon, for helping (in a monumental way) to change the world.

   Are there really any patented technical innovations in Tesla cars? As
   far as I am aware Teslas are based on the innovative (non-patentable)
   realization that there is a limited market for very expensive fast cars
   that have the snob appeal to make owners feel themselves
   forward-looking, virtuous, "non-polluters" (by ignoring the pollution
   caused by generating the electricity) and government subsidies.

   I always hated Microsoft for their closed source
   code idea to make money for licensing
   their patents on something they didn't create
   but got for nothing creating a monopoly
   on a public domain. Shame on you Bill Gates
   - the "richest man" in the world.
   What a difference comes from Tesla!
   They created something that transforms
   the world that no competition can even touch.
   And they are sharing it into the open source
   putting their money in for the greater good
   of people.
   No wonder they're also using Linux open source
   code for Tesla software platform.
   Don't worry Tesla shareholders!
   Remember what Larry Page said - that he would
   give up all his billions in a heartbeat to Elon
   Musk?
   Whatch now how many more billions will
   shake down towards Tesla in unison with

   Tesla, you say you want to expand your market to the scope of
   conventional cars, but frankly you seem more concerned with simply
   proving yourself to be a progressive company with good intentions. Why
   not make a simple electric car, and get rid of all the extensive luxury
   items which are driving the price up. A car that feels like a normal
   car but simply runs on electricity rather than gasoline, that's all
   that we need, that's how you get people to switch. But what you've
   given us is a rocket ship that too many people simply dismiss as
   impractical, and in many ways it's hard to disagree.

   Patents were initially designed to induce inventors to stop keeping
   secrets, in return for a decade or two of exclusive rights. "Trade
   secrets" are the alternative, and many still rely on them.

   But TM's IP is under little danger from the majors: they don't want it,
   and have no wish to out-produce or outperform TM wrt EVs. They want to
   keep them in a box, or in a landfill!

   I'm not sure this is all that bold or amazing. I think it is just good

   not enough of them to create the refueling resources needed to make
   them practical. If opening Tesla's patents helps to create a more
   robust electric car market then Tesla and all electric cars will win.

   It's a great idea and I know we all hope Tesla and its electric

   That's a great idea full of wisdom and courage. EV market needs more

   achieve it. As far as production capacity is concerned, as an
   international semiconductor company with a 6 inch and a 8 inch IGBT fab
   line and power module assembly line and establishing SiC line, we also
   have more than 50 years converter design experience and lead the
   evolution of China's high railway traction system. we are will to work
   closely with Tesla to provide Tesla specific/standard power electronics
   module, assembly and subsystem to help Tesla expand its production
   capacity. I believe there is a visible bright prospect with the
   combination of high railway technology and Automotive.

   A very interesting twist. However, I’m not so sure that releasing Tesla
   patents alone is a smart move. By all means, do that (there may be some
   who have the resources to do their own thing with the data), but run it
   concurrently with a few other strategic moves. Join forces with the
   likes of Nano Flowcell (www.nanoflowcell.com/en) to further develop
   what promises to be the ultimate battery technology at this stage, and
   then produce Tesla electric kits at various facilities around the globe
   (read localised production with minimal transportation) which can be
   retrofitted to existing vehicles. In my opinion, the primary problem is
   the continual mass production of new cars; petrol, diesel, electric -
   it matters not what powers them. The fact is that it takes a huge
   amount of non-renewable resources to manufacture new vehicles; +- 2
   tons of newly extracted materials for each one. Provide the means to
   upgrade existing cars with easily fitted kits, and a whole new restomod
   industry could be created. I’m a car nut, but I’m so over this
   incessant growth/production/consumption thing now. I want to see more
   reusing/repurposing/restoring, by creating some truly unique vehicles.
   In fact, this is on my list of hypothetical ventures...

   The car is very elegant, reported as a reliable vehicle, clean

   - They still think it's a non-reliable vehicle.
   - They think it's very expensive.

   Open Source is a very broad term, and, unfortunately, it's not entirely
   compatible with the concept of patents.

   While disclaiming any patent rights is a noble act, it does open up
   those patents to subversion by third parties. It is easy to imagine
   that such a third party may minimally modify one of the objects or
   procedures in one of your patents, and then claim a patent of their
   own, reserving all rights to such a patent.

   Thus, I hope you have not simply waived all your patent holder's
   rights, but have provided appropriate licensing for all your patents,
   ensuring, as most Open Source licenses worth mentioning do for
   software, that your patents cannot be used to create derivative patents
   for which their owners can then turn around and claim full patent
   rights.

   F*cking genius. This guy gives away his patents knowing it will
   stimulate growth in new designs and vehicles. Best part is his company
   OWNS THE INFRASTRUCTURE that these cars will need in the future. He's
   playing the long game. You sir, are a master player. Hats off.

   Great! We need more companies to do this, Tesla might inspire them. I
   do think it's a bold move, but also a smart one. I have a lot of
   confidence in open source combined with sustainable/growing business
   around a mission greater than the company itself. I've co-founded
   Ultimaker, a company that develops, produces and sells open source 3D
   printers. Our goal is to make 3D printing accessible, giving people
   freedom to make real things, whatever they can imagine.

   We're currently a leading company in this market, founded just a few
   years ago and doubling every year. We're growing so fast, without
   outside investment, even though we've open source our entire products.
   This means, design files, circuit board schematics, firmware and
   accompanying software. We believe in creating progress through
   collaboration and sharing, and open source is key part of that
   strategy.

   To me, Tesla and Elon Musk has for a long time been an enormous
   inspiration to me. It's great to see that our companies share more and
   more commonalities as time goes by. Plus, I'm a happy and proud Tesla
   customer (and I believe Tesla is happily making use of our
   Ultimakers!).

   I highly recommend these two TED talks one is totally on topic but also
   a bit of a shameless plug, I hope you won't mind:
     * TEDxUtrecht: The challenge of sharing (YouTube)
     * TED: Four principles of the open world (YouTube)
     * Our announcement to open source our product (Vimeo)

   If something seems to good to be true (and sounds like Dilbert) it
   probably is. Patents are what are known in the competitive capitalist
   world as intellectual property or IP. The most innovative companies
   compete for and hire the most innovative engineers who create IP which
   provides these comapanies equity. If you then give away the IP you have
   essentially handed your competition your engineers. As an engineer, why
   would you want to work at Tesla when your innovation, that was patented
   by your company, was handed to another company and the recogntion of
   your innovation was removed from the company patent wall. This is truly
   a boon for all the engineers at Tesla. The big automakers now have the
   license to hire all of Tesla's engineers and give them the recognition
   they deaserve. Tesla in return will be out of equity and out of
   business.

   Your bold decisions and contributions continue to amaze.

   This thought will likely drown in a sea of compliments, but
   nevertheless: I am eager to see how Tesla Motors will continue the
   sharing of inventions in the future. Will it stop applying for patents?
   Then inventions might become less accessible to other manufacturers and
   researchers. Will it publish them openly? That may help prevent others
   patenting the same idea. Will we get to an Open Source hardware
   solution eventually? These are exciting times.

   Interestingly I came across this today:
   Lichtenthaler says "The degree of patent protection does not facilitate
   successful open innovation". (Lichtenthaler U. 2009)
   If we are looking for an open world for knowledge sharing and crowd
   sourcing of knowledge, then patents do not make sense.

   The wise policy now is to keep very quiet about who takes up the
   options ... if one company knows another has plans for a toe in the
   water, they may sit back and wait ... if none of the companies know
   what the others are doing, they won't dare be lefy at the back of the
   pack!

   it nice to hear that your patents are now free to use.

   but for what are these patents for?
   the main reason is for over 100 years ago ferdinand porsche has done
   electric cars and plugin hybrid. even in that time there have been more
   electric cars on the street than otto motor based cars. it has all
   changed when the electric ignition was introduced.

   my point of view is that patents for mobility should be forbidden. but
   that is in the current law not possible.

   so at least it would be nice if there will be a non profit organisation
   that handles all the patents and corporation access to other company
   that think the same way like tesla. there are a lot of them in this
   world mostly small company's.

   Just read all of the above. Thanks Mr. Musk.
   Maybe now you will release the microflitch for the Model S. I asked for
   this when I received the Model S in March this year,but was told it was
   not available? I love driving my Model S but that is not the reason I
   purchased the car. I want to use the 85000 watt battery to power my
   house during the night, and be able to cut off the Hawaiian Electric
   utility.
   I have 40 PV panels on my roof producing about 9.5 KW
   with over 70 LED lights in the house.
   I think I will need a large expensive inverter to take power from the
   Model S, but I am not sure, I do need the microflitch to take it apart
   and make the modifications to use the power.

   The spirit of this statement is commendable but the details are

   this release, and a more legal statement allowing use. Ideally I would
   like to see these released into a patent pool such as devised by the
   EFF.

   Release into a patent pool would encourage others to also share their

   As Elon has said, the way to win in an innovative business is to
   out-innovate the competition, even surpassing your own accomplishments
   with new ones. Relying on defensive patents can breed complacency.

   Most engineers I know, including me, want to work at the "bleeding"
   edge of technology. When building a career, technical challenge comes
   first and compensation slides down the list of priorities.

   This breathtaking move is reminiscent of Spanish explorer Cortez, who
   burned his ships on reaching the New World to ensure his crews were
   well motivated. Tesla has already created an amazing culture of rapid
   innovation. This move will ensure Tesla's engineers are "well
   motivated" to accelerate their culture of innovation. Such a culture
   will serve to attract the very best engineering talent to the cause.

   Bravo Telsa! In the long run, this will be good for everyone
   (employees, shareholders, customers, industry and planet). It ensures
   Tesla will lead from the front and continue to raise the bar for years
   to come.

   @Mr. Musk - when a visionary makes a farsighted decision, there will
   always be naysayers and non-believers. I concur with your rationale
   that there should be an open platform to encourage development. Also,
   patents sometime outlive their usefulness.

   People forget that the formula to Coca Cola has never been patented,
   and since 1925, it has remained sealed in a vault in an Atlanta bank.
   There is a vast difference between protecting proprietary trade secrets
   and allowing use of disclosed information already subject to a patent.

   Let us not forget the format war between VHS (JVC) and Betamax (Sony).
   Betamax was clearly the better format, but Sony's decision not to have
   an open platform caused the Betamax's demise.

   I applaud your courage to be farsighted and have an open source
   philosophy. Future generations will acknowledge you as trailblazer with
   a philosophy that made America great.

   Is it possible for another company, like GM, to patent Tesla's
   technology and charge Tesla for it?
   Now that it is up for grabs, whoever patents it first, owns it.
   A company that didn't mind to bankrupt an entire city and is
   struggling, wouldn't pass up an opportunity like this.

   How about the Chinese? The Russians? They have shown to have no scruple
   when it comes to profit.

   TM is battery constrained. If a TM clone takes place tomorrow, they
   won't have enough batteries to compete with the same technology, thus
   will either buy it from TM's gigafactory, or build their own.

   The billionaire who bought Fisker might be interested in the patents.
   If I were Wangxiang, I'd build mines and gigafactories in China in less
   than half the amount of time Elon can build his at a fraction of TM's
   cost, while start R&D in the US on next gen today using those patents,
   and roll out the next generation first in China, then sell them to the
   US consumer, undercutting Tesla.

   I still believe that Tesla will win though, as long as Elon is there to
   attract the best talent.

   Tesla can further prove it wants to make a non planed obsolescence car.

   The title "All Our Patent Are Belong To You"
   is in reference to the classic Sega video game Zero Wing.
   In the introduction movie/animation it says, "All your base are belong
   to us."

   I'm not 100% but i'm pretty sure the phrase was translated from
   japanese to english and that's kind of just how it came out. The phrase
   has it's own infamy floating around in some of the darker places of the

   This reminds me of IBM's move in 80s to release the reference

   enable electric cars to achieve economies of scale, promote
   interchangeability of components and standardization.

   I also hope that Tesla becomes the "Microsoft" of electric cars - it

   Good on Elon and Tesla. No guarantee users of the info will build such
   beautiful cars.... but then, that's not the goal.

   Back in the day, when the Wright Bros. made aviation a reality in the
   U.S., they spend their remaining business time fighting to protect
   patents. They never again made any significant contributions to
   aviation.

   It was their contemporaries, the AEA, a group of true aviation
   geniuses, Thomas Selfridge (killed in a Wright plane), Alexander Graham
   Bell and Glenn Curtis, who pushed the window on aviation in America.
   [First plane used in warfare was a Curtis Jenny]. They didn't have any
   concerns about patents. They were only interested in aviation. Elon
   Musk would have been an active
   AEA inventor! http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Selfridge

   This is very cool…. but the cynical side of me can't avoid cataloging
   in my mind what I know of automotive and oil industry history. For over
   100 years, the auto manufacturers have had the to option develop and
   build electric vehicles.

   The first electric vehicle with rechargeable lead acid batteries was
   built in 1859.

   Thomas Edison had his batteries completed and in a Ford in 1913.
   Mysteriously his batteries "ran into problems" while being shipped to
   Detroit for integration into the cars, while his battery factory and
   lab mysteriously burnt to the ground at literally the same time.

   In essence, the industry has ignored or outright or worse, purchased
   and buried promising electric drive systems for cars ever since Thomas
   Edison's efforts.

   The Ovshinsky battery was Robert Ovshinsky's new battery after he
   invented the high-power, nickel-hydride batteries still used in
   virtually every hybrid around the world. Lithium-ion is just now
   replacing NiMH.

   The new battery was to be the break through technology way back in the
   early 2000's that would have caused an exponential growth of electric
   vehicles around the world.

   Chevron bought the company that had the patents and buried the design
   to keep the world from having it.

   What other technology can you think of (besides dirty energy) that
   stayed stuck on the same thing without progressing for over 100 years?
   Once the oil and auto industry killed electrics in the early part of
   the 20th century we remained stuck on internal combustion with no
   options for alternative ways to move us around.

   I have always said, we need to have at least one highly motivated
   billionaire to get us over the transition mountain that has been built
   by the oil, gas and auto industries. Even then it was going to be an
   uphill battle. It appears that Elon Musk is keenly aware of this and
   has determined that he can't do this alone.

   GM should be selling multiple platforms of their highly successful Volt
   by now, including trucks, vans and SUV's. Instead they come out with an
   over priced specialty car with the Cadillac ELR. A beautiful car but
   not one for the masses.

   Elon Musk and Nissan have been successful in dragging GM into the
   alternative transportation world at some level but in my opinion, GM is
   dragging their feet big time.

   It's good to see BMW and Volkswagon enter the EV space but what really
   needs to happen to get this thing to the next level is…… LARGE FORMAT
   EV's!

   Yes, we have Via Motors, and that is great, but we need to see GM, Ford
   and Chrysler building innovative large platform truck designs that
   include PHEV and EV technology. NOT trucks with bigger and bigger
   internal combustion engines!

   You think truckers wouldn't love not buying diesel fuel 2 - 3 times a
   week? Build a pickup truck with a 300 - 500 kW battery pack and a 1000
   horsepower electric motor and they will flock to EV's.

   It's time to take the next step and Elon Musk is doing everything he
   can to make that happen.

   Good on you Elon!

   This is an excellent move!
   Just make sure you hold the patents so no other company can patent
   these things. Shell owning the patent on an all water-run engine comes
   to mind...

   Please dont make something like that happend.

   Well played Elon! I continue to be amazed at the leadership position
   that Tesla Motors is taking! It takes a fearless company to take on all
   who would benefit from the "status quo". Tesla is just that! I'm proud
   to own a Model S and look forward to our Model X!

   This is a great initiative to help fight climate change: open the field
   for the best brains we have to develop the best battery that is
   cheap(er), lighter, non-polluting and will give Tesla and other
   electric cars the range they need to out-compete the old dirty
   fossil-run relics called cars today. I congratulate Mr. Musk.

   Hopefully this will also lead to lower costs so those of us that are
   not high earners can afford a Tesla.

   I would love a high range compact electric but but there is nothing in
   a price range I can afford. Those I can afford are not worth
   considering due to extremely limited range (80KM or so).

   EvaP
   1:43pm | Jun 13, 2014

   @Victor J W, I agree. One way to populare electric vehicles would be to
   make them available to the average Joe. I think making an affordable EV
   for the mainstream clients would do more good for the planet than
   giving away the patents.

   Let's face it, Tesla is still a status symbol and unattainable for most
   of us. Elon is a very rich man. Maybe, somebody should remind him of
   what it is like to be struggling middle class. Making Tesla into a
   luxury item defeats the purpose.

   Elon is the messiah of the rich as it is now. Let's hope it will
   change.

   AWESOME NEWS!! I seriously was just thinking yesterday, that "I wonder
   if Tesla would ever consider making a retro-fit kit for existing
   gasoline cars?" Or even "if I wanted to make my own EV based on my own
   design, would Tesla be willing to sell me just the drive train to power
   it. "The Jaeger Axis, powered by Tesla"…

   I recently toured the plant here in the Bay Area and was smitten with
   the tech, and the concept, but sadly I'm not one who can afford a Model
   S, but now I'm seriously considering the VW E Golf when it arrived
   later this year as my stepping stone into EV's.
   This news however makes the future a bit brighter and a bit closer!

   Great move! I speak as one of the pioneers of the Open Source movement
   in the field of software. Intellectual Property seems like a good idea
   on the surface but it inevitably allows the powerful to just acquire
   more and more and more so in the end is bad news for the survival of
   the human race.

   There is another non software release of IP, also related to Tesla
   (Nicola) that your engineers may like to take a look at
   http://www.libertariannews.org/2014/06/05/open-source-free-energy-gener
   a...

   When these things have been worked on before the inventors have had a
   habit of dissappearing. See Forster Gamble's Thrive film for info about
   what has been going on. Sharing work as open source avoids that fate.

   A hybrid car with this plus batteries for town driving would be
   awesome!

   Mixed emotions about this announcement. Inspiring, smart, can change

   Model S, I couldn't reaffirm more my decision to give $90,000 to a
   company like this. My hesitation to invest in their stocks is now
   completely gone. The world needs more leadership like this.
   Wasn't Nikola Tesla screwed out of patents by Edison and the world
   remembers Edison as the mastermind and inventor instead of those that
   made it happen? Very interesting .......

   afford to legally fight obstructions, ever since I believe in open

   Open Source is the embodiment of creative engineering and curiosity. It
   is the essence of global unity through uninhibited tech freedom.

   I see hope every time someone decides to just put stuff out there. We
   need more support as a community like maker spaces and training fairs
   for future innovators. Engineering is a field that is best learned
   hands on and applied.

   Thanks for giving the world an opportunity to try and improve a great
   platform. I see a long and expensive path for myself before I can
   contribute.

   Elon! Come to Arizona! We have a rich culture of openness.

   A lot of people are saying AZ is out of the running on the location for
   the Gigafactory. There are so many reasons to come here.

   We have several Open Source user groups in the Valley such as PLUG -
   the Phoenix Linux Users Group.

   We have many technical people who work with non proprietary software
   and technology with a passion.

   Many companies here have open source/free software ambassadors.

   I'm here. and... I thank you from the bottom of my heart!

   Whether you decide to move that Gigafactory here or not, come visit and
   speak at one of our Linux User Groups. Last night we were discussing
   patents and the importance of opening up technology.

   I applaud you for your decision and action in moving the arts and
   sciences forward. Bless you!

   Thank you! :)

   You'll excuse the skepticism, but AZ having a rich culture of openness

   the richness of culture, also yes. Politically, open is NOT how I'd
   describe AZ.

   I think this is naïve and a big mistake. Tesla is competing against
   entire countries, and an iceberg of new technology, which will impact,
   and blindside (my view) his enterprise. Does Tesla's lack of success
   with the Dealer issue, indicate a deeper structural problem. My view is
   yes. How that was blown is beyond me.You have to be born in America and
   inculcated here to understand what legal angles work,which attorney's
   work; And understand the legal system, is inbred, old boyish, like the
   Auto industry? How strange!. I think there is evidence the operation
   has analogs to generals fighting the last war. I tried to present Tesla
   with important auto tech which I am sure they were not intimately savvy
   with, but could not get past the lieutenants. Not good.

   I approve of this message (and decision). It also means Tesla can focus

   lawsuits when another company finally decides to emulate Tesla.
   Brilliant! This also proves that patents are obsolete, as is oil by the
   way.

   Mr. Musk:

   Great News for those interested in your company's technology!

   Can you please back up this press release with actual
   details/procedures?

   Can you please direct those that are interested in practicing your
   company's patented technology a contact where they can receive a
   royalty-free, perpetual license to practice your company's technology,
   as the release suggests? No company will start willfully practice
   another company's technology without assurances they will not be sued
   (a press release does not cut it).

   Can you have your IT folks upload a perpetual, royalty free licence
   like the one above, signed by you, so that it can be easily downloaded
   and signed by companies that want to practice your patented technology?

   Can you specify which patents you are actually talking about? Does this
   mean all of Tesla's patents? In any country?

   The spirit behind this press release is great. Now, we need details.

   Thank you again for such a generous thing that you are doing.
   I,and others, look forward to seeing how you are actually going to get
   this done.

   I congratulate Tesla on a bold move. I am wondering, however, if "open
   source" is really the solution to the "problem". From my perspective as
   an engineer, inventor, and (gasp!) a patent agent, what incentive do I
   have to contribute my time and talents to Tesla's open source car. I
   believe that Tesla and all companies would be better off by creating a
   system for inviting and rewarding contributions from individuals across
   the world. Currently, the open source movement does not reward
   contribution so it is about as effective in fueling innovation as a
   communist collective.

   Free markets are successful because they foster the exchange of goods
   and services. I believe that patents are currently ineffective because
   of the effort and complexity (I.e. cost) involved in compensating the
   inventors and investors behind the inventors including companies. I
   believe that the is mainly due to the cost of licensing and litigation
   rather than patenting.

   It is sad and ironic that one of the motivations for having patents, to
   reward individuals for their creative works, is so inconsistently
   achieved with our current legal system. However, the solution to this
   issue may not be legal per se, but our business culture. I believe that
   the open source movement attempts to change the culture of product
   development largely without economic exchange and will consequently be
   ineffective at accelerating innovation.

   I would encourage Tesla and others to not just be "open" but also to
   create a market for solutions. Such a market could embrace patents
   (when advantageous) rather than demonize them!

   Tremendous move Elon and somehow made me think about that excellent

   “...The way of life can be free and beautiful. But we have lost the
   way.

   Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate; has
   goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed.

   We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in; machinery that
   gives abundance has left us in want.
   Our knowledge has made us cynical,
   our cleverness hard and unkind.
   We think too much and feel too little.
   More than machinery we need humanity,
   more than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness.

   Without these qualities life will be violent and all will be lost.”

   Very well said, Elon Musk, perhaps more than obvious to all. In saying
   "Tesla will not initiate patent lawsuits against anyone who, in good
   faith, wants to use our technology," you have protected the technology.
   Otherwise, as too often happens in a tough corporate business world, a
   corporation could patent the technology with no intention of utilizing
   it, but only to prevent a rival company from using the technology to
   provide better products for the customers. Another possible effect
   might be to free Tesla Motors from being locked into its own current
   focus, and open up a new look at the more basic need, that of providing
   means for sustainable and fully functional transportation for all. For
   example, surely it does not require the energy to move a ton of steel,
   plastic and glass, to move a 165 pound person quickly and safely from
   place to place, even at hundreds of mph. There are lots of approaches
   to the actual transportation system's need fulfillments yet to be
   explored, given the actual freedom to do so.

   Tesla had many patents, and yes he certainly would agree with you on
   the headaches that comes with them. I wonder also, if I get my project
   'Bmeup' developed, should I do likewise. Teleporting large objects and
   humans most certainly would be a huge benefit for humanity and patents
   would just clutter the advancement. I also believe Tesla was the
   originator of the concept to perform this application, however, he did
   not have technology during his time to bring it forward.

   People that were using Tesla's equipment, i.e. Hutchinson, and others;
   had matter moving through the air - in effect teleporting. Of course
   many other events happening today also proving its feasibility and the
   potential to develop it using today's technology (slightly modified).
   The technology would only be the product one could patent.

   Elon Musk isn't afraid of giving away his original technology because
   he's committed TeslaMotors to continuous innovation. By the time a
   competitor has copied a design, his engineers will have raised the bar.
   Also, TeslaMotors will have a huge advantage in battery technology. If
   the Gigafactory pays off, he will be offering long-range electrics at
   mid-range prices that will attract a huge buying public. I applaud his
   gesture, but don't fool yourself into thinking he's taking a big risk
   to save the planet. It's a sound business decision that also happens to
   work for the common good.

   compete in the auto industry. Great move.

   For anyone who is interested, I'm starting a website at
   www.teslaopensource.com devoted to making these newly open sourced
   patents more accessible to the public. If anyone is interested in
   contributing or has any suggestions, drop me a line at
   admin@teslaopensource.com.

   Paul (paul@permanenti) wrote, "Elon's response on this seems to be that
   the consumer market for cars is large enough which makes him to seem
   content with a smaller piece of the pie."

   Actually, Elon Musk merely pointed out the salient fact that though
   100% of internal combustion engine vehicles need to be removed from the
   road, Tesla Motors cannot do it alone. They cannot supplant the current
   100,000,000 unit annual automobile production of the world. They cannot
   replace 2,000,000,000 operational ICE vehicles worldwide.

   Even if Tesla were the sole major manufacturer of electric vehicles and
   doubled their production, every year, for twenty years, it won't be
   enough to reach that goal. At that rate, it would take another 12 years
   for Tesla to match the output of the current world leader in sales. But
   other companies would still be producing cars that burn gasoline or
   other products derived from hydrocarbons the entire time. It would take
   another four years to supplant the entire production of ground vehicles
   worldwide. But people would still be using the billions of existing ICE
   vehicles, polluting the air the entire time.

   This problem must be attacked from multiple fronts. Since the existing
   automotive industry will not change, it is necessary to foster the rise
   of a separate electric vehicle industry. It is better to have 25% of
   the entire EV industry, than to be the sole runner with 2% of the
   entire automotive industry.

   Paul continued, "...I wish I can gain his thoughts on how this will
   affect TSLA stockholders."

   Then you can listen to the Q & A with Elon Musk that followed the
   initial announcement. My take is that investors must understand that
   Tesla will likely be the biggest manufacturer of electric vehicles for
   at least the next ten years. Even with doubling their production output
   every year over that time, they would be lucky to have between 12% and
   13% of the entire automotive market.

   That might be enough to put some smaller players out of business, but
   everyone else would still be producing scores of millions of
   hydrocarbon burning vehicles. People the world over will not just stop
   buying cars to wait for Tesla's production to catch up with need. But
   if another ten electric car companies can arrive in that time frame,
   each garnering 4% to 8% of the worldwide automotive market, then the
   death knell can be rung for the internal combustion engine that much
   sooner.

   Hâte de voir ces brevets développés à grande échelle.
   C'est une réelle opportunité de développement des technologies TESLA en

   I always thought that a business based on patents does not have a true
   sustainable advantage. The only thing you should build and protect is
   the brand name. If you own a new technology, then use it to be the
   first to market it and build a renowned brand, but don't spend
   resources trying to protect it.

   Tesla also found out that big established competitors rarely make
   efforts to invest much in niche markets, which ultimately allows new
   entrants to disrupt some sectors.

   Well done Tesla guys.

   This is the thing. Until internal combustion engines are outlawed, all
   other vehicle power sources will remain uncompetitive. Hey, I'm just as
   fed up with fossil fuel as the next guy but let's face it, limited
   range and slow recharge batteries are somewhat inconvenient.
   Now if someone discovers how to make a nuclear power source fool-proof,
   inexpensive and drive a car 2,000,000
   miles before refueling, I'm willing to listen.
   The only other possibility is fuel cell technology, but that's not
   inexpensive either.
   Hey I'm reasonable,..... maybe someone needs to apply the cat o'nine
   tails on the in-house inventors with a little more aggressiveness.

   "...receiving a patent really just meant that you bought a lottery
   ticket to a lawsuit..." These words ring so true for my colleagues and
   I, who, only just 6 months ago had to negotiate a settlement in an
   ownership lawsuit that we felt was completely unjust and ill-advised.
   Not a single dollar has been earned thus far, save for that earned by
   the lawyers; investor funding has been seriously affected as a
   consequence of the suit. In part jest I told my lawyer that I thought
   that his profession was the single most contributor to inflation.

   However,there was a more serious consequence. We had sought protect our
   invention for the very same reasons described by Elon. We hoped that
   the example we were setting would be an inspiration to others who live
   in a developing country like ours that still has an awful lot to learn
   a lot about innovation as a tool for survival and sustainable growth.
   That legal action and, now, Elon's initiative has made us quite aware
   of the need for alternative strategies in strengthening the innovative
   culture we would like to see.

   Elon Musk has taken a leap of faith. This is an example of a small step
   in the evolution of humans to the next level.

   Patents are a manifestation of capitalism and belong to the 20th
   century. All knowledge must be free; the fruits of research and
   inventions should reach all of humankind.

   I am sure Tesla Motors and Elon Musk will go down in history as big

   @lessaworld

   The title is actually correct given the intention. It's a direct
   reference to an old Japanese game that was badly translated to English
   at the time it came out. Look it up on WikiPedia. Search for "All Your
   Base Are Belong to Us".

   His original blog post title was a clever way of stating his vision
   without writing it in correct English and creating an even bigger legal
   debate. It was probably assumed that after a quick search on the web,
   people, by analogy and comparison, would quickly realize that the post
   title he probably had in mind was something like "All of our patents
   now belong to you.", but again saying that in plain English would be
   tricky.

   Kudos to him for the creativity!

   This is a nice gesture by Musk. But since the patents were achieved at

   A WORD OF WARNING!!!

   The Sun Microsystems was also pretty decent company in terms of
   non-sueing, but later, when the Oracle acquired the Sun Microsystems,
   Oracle started to use the patents of its acquired Sun Microsystems very
   offensively.

   Unless You take some legal action to make sure that the next party, who
   gets to own the Tesla Motors and its intellectual property, can not
   start to use the patents offensively, people must still avoid "stepping
   on them".

   That is to say, the fact that the current owners of the Tesla Motors
   are decent, does not mean that the next owners of the Tesla Motors and
   its patents will be decent.

   A citation from a press release that explains, how Oracle was able to
   throw out the Apache Foundation and effectively destroyed the Java,
   regardless of the fact that the Sun Microsystems open-sourced that
   great project.

   "Oracle provided the EC with a Java SE 7 specification request and
   license that are self-contradictory, severely restrict distribution of
   independent implementations of the spec, and most importantly, prohibit
   the distribution of independent open source implementations of the
   spec."

   The "EC" in the citation stood for “Executive Committee".

   que me gustaría es que hiciesen un cálculo o previsión de negocio en mi
   país, aquí en Andalucía se cerró la única fábrica automovilistica que
   teníamos, SANTANA MOTOR en el año 2011 y seguro que a TESLA le podría
   venir muy bien ensamblar o fabricar en España, como hacen otras
   empresas, como Ford en Valencia, Opel en Zaragoza, Citroën en Vigo.

   ¿Por qué no fabricar Tesla en Linares?, seguro que les sale muy muy

   "Open Source" moves from code to electro-mechanical engineering to
   energy conversion efficiencies. Patents once protected enterprising
   effort and fueled innovation. In too many cases they've become
   vine-like menaces choking the natural flora of free thought. There's
   not enough Round-Up in the world to cope with the trolls and little
   likelihood we'd get a pro bono effort from Monsanto for a targeted
   herbicide. Apple vs Samsung? Will Pyrrhic become the acceptable norm
   for IP contests?

   Elon Musk and others constitute a new breed whose arrival on the scene
   may usher forth a new expediency: JIT-C, Just In Time in Carbon terms.
   The Musk move is not a must for all. There are plenty of initiatives
   that still depend on and deserve the revenue stream protection that
   patents provide. Let's not debate an all-or-none buy-in about open IP.
   Case-by-case sounds like a plan.

   In 2008’s “Closing the Innovation Gap” Judy Estrin laments the USA’s
   innovation ecosystem being at risk. She prescribes 5 core values:
   Questioning, Risk, Openness, Patience, Trust. Elon Musk is firing on
   all five cylinders!

   It was startling to hear during a conversation as part of London
   Technology Week, that Elon/Tesla had done this. It was therefore a
   pleasant surprise, when checking the veracity of these claims, to
   discover this page. In the spirit of the moment I hope both Tesla and
   wider readers will be interested in some ideas first circulated to a
   few organizations over a decade ago that could radically enhance the
   acceleration of Tesla’s growth.

   An alternative vehicle design could augment a smaller core battery with
   two or more ‘swappable’ ‘energy cassettes’ weighing around 40Kg. The
   original idea, conceived prior to ubiquitous GPS, was that these could
   be ‘presented’ to vehicles like wheeled hand luggage, whereupon
   ‘receiving arms’ would pull them into their under-floor housings. This
   was so they could be handled by anyone. One can also see these managed
   by roving trucks liaising with vehicle systems, to intercept owners at
   mutually acceptable, in-journey exchange-points, where specialists then
   quickly change them. Alternatively each vehicle or exchange point could
   have a battery exchange dolly for removing and inserting units.

   Drawing from how multi-layered standards protocols accelerated telecoms
   innovation, ultimately, apart from various dimensional, performance and
   environmental parameters, there need be no prescriptions as to what
   technology had to be inside the cassettes. The concept opens multiple
   innovation paths and can be a stepping stone to a gas-station free
   future. In the nearer term it can also add flexibility to such
   vehicles, as when in-journey access to swappable units can either be
   pre-arranged or has a certainty of being realised, much longer journeys
   become feasible. Where owners only use such vehicles for local
   commutes, the bays for heavy swappable cassettes can also be left
   empty, to increase vehicle efficiency.

   Rather more thought has been applied to this and there is also a
   ‘basket’ of related ideas covering advanced vehicles, freight and
   public transport I would love to share and build upon in a spirit of
   open innovation. Whist I have not resolved the engineering issues,
   based upon my experience and masters’ degrees in Computing and Applied
   Electronics and Business Administration, I believe there are credible
   technical and commercial roadmaps forward, encompassing these concepts.
   It was news about Tesla’s ‘Gigafactories’ that prompted recollection of
   these ideas some weeks ago. This hugely important move to now release
   enabling intellectual property to what I understand is the creative
   commons, prompts this submission. If anyone is interested in
   collaborating on such projects than can further help the trajectory of
   humankind, please get in contact via thinkofthefuture dot org. Thank
   you.

   I just want to see the world be a better place, I'll set my career
   advancement aside. The secret to creating an electric vehicle market is
   NOT creating a bunch of electric vehicles, that is to say NOT YET, the
   secret is creating a system of converting the countless combustion
   engine vehicles all ready out there to electric. We need to stop
   throwing away the old and replacing it with new, instead upgrade the
   old to the new. Otherwise we are just creating a new problem with
   billions of combustion engine vehicular trash cluttering up our already
   limited space. I see 2 ways of conversion, 1: and the most costly,
   invest in building conversion stations or garages all around America
   and the World or 2: the best solution, is to make your enemies your
   friends(the other car manufacturers being your enemies) and sell them
   the conversion systems and parts, allow them to make money from the
   labor, you make money from the conversion systems and parts, they
   already have the mechanics and garages/stations in place, everybody
   wins. Once we have converted massive amounts of combustion engine
   vehicles to electric, America's and the World's mindset will change,
   thereby allowing the electric vehicle market to create itself. Next,
   create a system of vehicular recycling. Then, with the governments
   help, provide large discounts and tax breaks for exchanging your
   combustion engine vehicle and/or your converted electric vehicle for an
   all electric vehicle. Obviously, there are numerous logistical and
   legal issues to overcome, I neither have the time nor resources to
   think about and overcome these, but you do.

   Lots of awesome comments on the business side of this (which I don't
   want to pass over because its amazing- you just open sourced cars -
   welcome, world, to the future of everything).

   That's been covered in the 400+ comments. What I think is just beyond
   epic is that you did it with a 15 year old meme that only hard core
   engineers/nerds would even understand. I can imagine the picture of all
   the major car company's boards screaming to have someone go get a Sega
   and dragging in a TV to the board room to explain it. Outside of the
   patents what else is he trying to say?!? Hilarious. And I'm sure it
   happened.

   I f**ing love my Tesla. It feels like a bunch of very, very smart
   people completely erased their minds of how cars were built and
   designed a thing to get you places faster, and it happens to have 4
   wheels. First principle framework actually being used to make a
   tangible thing beyond amazing. And other people love them too - which
   is strange - the person in the expensive Porsche is an A**Hole, but
   even non Tesla owners love the brand and are excited to meet anyone
   who's purchased the brand. The technology advancements on lithium ion
   are beyond compare, but to somehow establish such an amazing brand
   while doing that is amazing.

   Test driving a Tesla was like seeing an iPhone for the first time.

   An inventor write ...

   As someone with three granted patents and a fourth patent application
   about to be granted in a few days time plus pending patent applications
   in 43 counties I salute Elon's decision. Tesla Motors through its
   patent portfolio has created a platform which cries out for
   standardisation around Tesla's intellectual property - and unpatentable
   knowhow and marketing rights will consolidate its business. In these
   circumstances it is very commercially sound to open the company’s
   patent portfolio up to all acting in "good faith" and Tesla Motors has
   the financial and intellectual muscle to ensure that this action works
   to be long term benefit of Tesla shareholders.

   Anyone who has any lingering doubts about the validity of Elon's
   decision should look at a 2008 book called Against Intellectual
   Monopoly (Hardcover) by Michele Boldrin (Author), David K. Levine
   (Author). They are two distinguished American economists undertook a
   critical analysis of how intellectual property law affected innovation.
   Their findings if better known could have just as revolutionary an
   impact amongst high church priests of intellectual property protection
   as Darwin's work on the Origin of Species did on the scientific
   establishment a century and a half ago.

   The heresy which Boldrin and Levine put forward is that copyright and
   patent protections are not the engines of growth in our civilization.
   They do not protect creative people and they materially harm society
   and economic growth. We would all be better off if they were to be
   immediately abolished. You can read my review of their book on my
   website at http://www.alikelman.com/page15.htm

   Theirs is an extreme thesis but Boldrin and Levine make a good case in
   its support. Elon has taken the sensible step in 'pump priming' the
   electric car market by his decision

   Intellectual rights were invented to fuel innovation, in pure
   intellectual and complex things, like novels, mathematics, programs and
   many others. But patents are very different, in that, even if someone
   invents a similar thing he cannot put his own intellectual rights into
   it, thus effectively struggling innovation. In addition intellectual
   rights are applied to the process, and patents are applied to the
   result, that's definitely an anticapitalist measure because many things
   may end up to the same result by using very different procedures.

   That's all very tiring and i should not try to expand more, but that
   all is going to get right when Greeks will conquer the whole lot of
   America, and apply our good logical laws, in return of what else than
   heavy taxation? Calcium is a much more natural material to 3d-print
   than titanium, not so hard properties, but much more abundant.

   As a patent attorney I agree with Elon Musk that Tesla's patents are
   not very valuable. Tesla is using a technology largely developed 50-100
   years ago, and its "inventions" are minor scientific advances in a
   crowded field. The low value of Tesla's patents reflects the genius of
   the patent system in awarding narrow patent protection to minor
   technical advances. Tesla's actual achievement is having packaged an
   old technology in a very pretty package and challenging the energy
   paradigm of the oil-based world economy. Tesla would be better served
   by trumpeting its actual achievements instead of cravenly appealing to
   the anti-intellectualism of the current times that considers patents
   the enemy. Then maybe the Tesla engineers could find a way to stop my
   Model S from rattling like a tin can---or better yet borrow that
   "technology" from the Germans too.

   Brilliant move--no question.

   But is there no one in Tesla who proofreads these posts?

   "All our patent are belong to you"?

   Not being able to construct a proper sentence in the English language
   detracts from what should be a very powerful message delivered by your
   brilliant and inspirational blog post.

   Seeing forward to the day when I myself can afford to buy a Tesla..

   Meanwhile.. here is som thoughts from me: Instead of using LED lamps in
   the car, why not have a central lightforce (placed under the hood ?)
   with separate fiberoptics to every lightsource needed? You would
   eliminate lots of copperwiring AND weight.

   Solarpanels on almost every surface facing the sun, as a complementary
   to the battery, maybe to use for the AC, fans etc..

   Instead of charging stations where the car stands still, build charging
   lanes where you charge the car with induction technology..

   How do you utilize the heat from the electric motors today?

   Thinking about using nanotechnology when painting the cars?

   Since the title is encoded, perhaps the rest of the message is as
   well?!

   Mr. Musk, is this a call to whoever identifies with BEV manufacturing
   and would like to help disrupting ICE powered vehicles' dominance?!

   If so, I couldn't thank you enough. What shall we do in order to
   benefit from Tesla Motors' Patents, without infringing them?

   Do small workshops qualify as well or only OEMs do?

   Are BEV Start-Ups under radar?!

   This truly is a bold move and completely different from what others did
   dominating certain markets. An EV market is actually still in its
   embryo phase compared to how big it could become.

   I believe there is no threat to Tesla Motors even if all OEMs on, a
   global scale, embrace this opportunity, drop what they have been doing
   in order to shift to BEV production in a blink of an eye. They simply
   cannot afford doing so, since they cope with lengthly processes better.

   Elon Musk must be overloaded with CVs from great people begging him to
   work together. There couldn't be more intelligent way replying on them
   all in a single gesture - let's work together! I believe hearing this
   between the lines :)

   It has been two weeks already, since publishing of this note and this
   is not self explanatory to me … to whom should I write for fine print,
   licensing agreements, or finding out how this declaration is going to
   be practically empowered?

   Many thanks Tesla Motors!
   Good luck to you all!
   Elon Musk, you rock!

   Elon Musk & Brethren of Tesla Motors;

   I need your help. My fiancé & I have been house hunting this past year,
   we want to buy before we have our ceremony. In this seemingly endless
   quest of questionable properties, slow-stepping real estate agents &
   tainted banking systems, we have realized that what is considered
   “modern living” isn’t the route for us. Through research, it has become
   obvious there are many obtainable ways of living efficiently. We are
   trying to allow these methods to be easily accessible to all humans so
   we can soften the blow we are pounding into the earth on every level.
   We have to reduce our reliance of fossil fuels, you know this more than
   anyone. There are off-the-grid living options, but between the loss of
   energy while converting and the limited storage space of the energy
   itself, the benefits of going off-the-grid do not always shine brighter
   than the combustible options that we currently burn through. Energy
   cannot be created nor destroyed, only shifted. I want to assist you in
   beginning a wider-ranged shift by building a self-sustaining home. I
   have seen the visionary works of Michael Reynolds, however the systems
   his Earthship possess are unattainable for me due to the high price tag
   that accompanies them. In the spirit of your recent release of all the
   wonderful patents from the enlightened minds of your company, I am
   asking for your help in building this home for my growing family. I do
   not have access to the idealistic consciousness of architects &
   physicists that you currently possess. With your help, I can show all
   the powerful souls I surround myself with how necessary and accessible
   this global change can be. We are going to buy a piece of land to begin
   this journey on with, or without your help. With the innovative insight
   that the great minds of Tesla Motors will contribute to the issue at
   hand, (imagine Tesla Homes) you will change the world. A generation
   grown alongside the food they eat and raised with the power of actually
   understanding the development & distribution of energy is a generation
   tuned into the torus. This Generation; it’s already here. The time is
   now, and we, the people, are ready to prove our worth to the planet and
   future of our species.

   Life of Love,
   Talena Faye

   Tesla stands for natural beauty of a rose on the rose bush which turns
   into ugliness when captured in a flower Vase.

   I love Tesla (not my Tesla... for ownership degrades beauty). I just
   got one three days ago. I have had an ecstasy driving it for the last
   three days. I would have no complains if it got stolen tomorrow ..

   If I had a tonne of money I would rather give it to Tesla Motors.

   "In good faith" ??? It's like keeping the store and giving away the
   candy. It really is a shame that a certain political philosophy has
   enveloped such a fantastic company and product. I guess that most of
   the commenters here must get goose bumps and dewey eyed when a
   terrorist is released "in good faith" (and we have recent first had
   knowledge of their brand of good faith). The Model S and it's siblings
   can stand on their own merits without all the junk science climate
   hoopla. Why tie a fantastic vehicle to a hoax that is designed to
   control peoples lives and steal their money. Want to cut CO2 emissions,
   quit breathing or replace all us humans with robots. Tell me Mr. Musk,
   will the UAW act "in good faith" when it takes over Tesla?? And... as
   long as you are in a giving mood, how about giving me a new Model S,
   top of the line and a Supercharger for my garage. I truly wish you
   luck.

   As a career woman who was laid off as an Asst. To CEO I am so upset
   that I need a job and would love to buy a Tesla. Bring us free energy
   Elon! Its time to have what Tesla dies for! The greed of those who
   murdered him should not be lining pockets when the entire world could
   have free energy hence we coukd feed the masses and it woukd be the
   most amazing change for our planet. For owners I applaud you! I wish I
   coukd afford one but I need to find a good position in Exeter NH. I
   realize this is not a job search page but I believe and have loved
   Tesla from the early days of my interest in free radiant energy . It is
   possible if we demand it and stand for it. Congrats Elon for making a
   change . I hope this is but a pebble that begins a move so all can
   afford this wonderful way to live ! Let's save the world now guys! Its
   time to take Tesla dream and make it available to EVERYONE EVERYWHERE!
   Oh how the Elite energy owners will be crying as thier empire crumbles!
   I pray to see this in my lifetime or my chikdren see this. My sons have
   watched the movies and know and have dreams of making free radiant
   energy a reality . It has begun with a car and Tesla woukd be so proud!
   Now let's roll! We can so this if we have the elites who are not greedy
   and want to make it happen. Once its done it done and all the oil has
   and power companies will be old museums that will destroy our planet.
   Its up to you all out there with the money and bravery to fight the
   real people in power and we all know who THEY ARE! They have enough to
   survive many lifetimes . Let's give all people a chance. Can you
   imagine how this woukd help people be self reliant and decrease poverty
   world wide?! Alll I need is a job and I will buy my Tesla and work to
   become self reliant . Anyone need an Asst . To CEO? I am expeptional
   and with years of experience and education I would love to work and to
   be a part of bringing this dream to the masses woukd make my dream come
   true! Thanks Elon! I hope one day I can Order one for myself! At least
   this proves that there are wealthy people out there who want the same
   thing! I only hope the owners are not greedy owners of oil stocks and
   getting rich off the poor and buying a Tesla to be yet more wealthy
   without making a real change. This is amazing! Some day Elon I will
   order my car and light my home if inly we forge ahead!

   Tesla is forging ahead with Elon Musk at its helm. I have read many
   articles and watched video interviews about opening the patents to help
   drive faster innovation and save the planet too. The market has
   responded positively to this approach. We look forward to getting the
   best EV on the road soon and the more EV that sell, the more affordable
   they become to the consumer.
   Feedback on the design, I find the front/bumper part a bit weird, it
   looks like a mouth & the headlights like eyes. Influenced by
   Transformers Autobots? Would prefer a more classic design. The back is
   ok.

   It's taken me a while to create an account on the site, but I wanted to
   say that Elon is brilliant. He is changing the world in so many ways!
   This is an incredible gesture, and shows the true goal of Tesla Motors:
   revolutionize the vehicle industry, and make a fundamental change in
   our world. Although we are still pretty far from gaining independence
   from oil, we are on the right track. Hopefully, automakers will
   increase the production of EVs, and make them affordable for the
   general population.

   For those criticizing the title, have you ever heard of the phrase "all
   your base are belong to us"? It's been used in many video games, and it
   actually originates from a game released in 1991. Just do a Google
   search for more info. I think the title is clever. It definitely made
   me smile!

   give up too. I promise you now it is time to change the way we
   generates our electric power ,and of cause we will stop using fossil
   fuel. We will look on you ,and we will trust you. Don't give up.
