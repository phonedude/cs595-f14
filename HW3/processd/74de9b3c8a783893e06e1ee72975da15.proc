Mariana Mazzucato

The Entrepreneurial State: Debunking Private vs. Public Sector Myths

     * About Mariana Mazzucato
     * Introduction
     * Summary
     * Ôòë Ôòê Ôòì

   Mariana Mazzucato is an economist whose research focuses on the role of
   the state in modern capitalism. Currently the RM Phillips chair in the
   Economics of Innovation at the University of Sussex, she is also author
   of the book The Entrepreneurial State: Debunking Private vs. Public
   Sector Myths.
     * Mariana Mazzucato's Homepage
     * Mariana Mazzucato's Wikipedia page

   Where do the boldest innovations, with the deepest consequences for
   society, come from?

   Many business leaders, entrepreneurs, and libertarians claim that the
   private sector leads the way always, and government at best follows by
   decades and at worst impedes the process with bureaucratic regulations.

   Mariana Mazzucato proves otherwise.  Many of the most profound
   innovations‚Äîfrom the Internet and GPS to nanotech and biotech ‚Äîhad
   their origin in government programs developed specifically to explore
   innovations that might eventually attract private sector interest.
   Ignoring this entrepreneurial risk taking role of government has
   fuelled a very different story about governments role in the economy,
   and also fuelled the dysfunctional dynamic whereby risk is
   socialised‚Äîwith tax payers absorbing the greatest risk--- but rewards
   are not. Mazzucato will argue that socialization of risk, privatization
   of rewards is not only bad for the future of innovation eco-systems but
   also a key driver of inequality. What to do about it?

   Mazzucato is a professor of the Economics of Innovation at Sussex
   University and author of The Entrepreneurial State: debunking private
   vs. public sector myths.

Government as radical, patient VC

   The iPhone, Mazzucato pointed out, is held up as a classic example of
   world-changing innovation coming from business.

   Yet every feature of the iPhone was created, originally, by
   multi-decade government-funded research. From DARPA came the microchip,
   the Internet, the micro hard drive, the DRAM cache, and Siri. From the
   Department of Defense came GPS, cellular technology, signal
   compression, and parts of the liquid crystal display and multi-touch
   screen (joining funding from the CIA, the National Science Foundation,
   and the Department of Energy, which, by the way, developed the
   lithium-ion battery.) CERN in Europe created the Web. Steve Jobs‚Äô
   contribution was to integrate all of them beautifully.

   Venture Capitalists (VCs) in business expect a return in 3 to 5 years,
   and they count on no more than one in ten companies to succeed. The
   time frame for government research and investment embraces a whole
   innovation cycle of 15 to 20 years, supporting the full chain from
   basic research through to viable companies. That means they can develop
   entire new fields such as space technology, aviation technology,
   nanotechnology, and, hopefully, Green technology.

   But compare the reward structure. Government takes the greater risk
   with no prospect of great reward, while VCs and businesses take less
   risk and can reap enormous rewards. ‚ÄúWe socialize the risks and
   privatize the rewards.‚Äù Mazzucato proposes mechanisms for the eventual
   rewards of deep innovation to cycle back into a government ‚Äúinnovation
   fund‚Äù---perhaps by owning equity in the advantaged companies, or
   retaining a controlling ‚Äúgolden share‚Äù of intellectual property rights,
   or through income-contingent loans (such as are made to students).
   ‚ÄúAfter Google made billions in profits, shouldn‚Äôt a small percentage
   have gone back to fund the public agency (National Science Foundation)
   that funded its algorithm?‚Äù In Brazil, China, and Germany, state
   development banks get direct returns from their investments.

   The standard narrative about government in the US is that it stifles
   innovation, whereas the truth is that it enables innovation at a depth
   that business cannot reach, and the entire society, including business,
   gains as a result. ‚ÄúWe have to change the way we think about the
   state,‚Äù Mazzucato concludes.
