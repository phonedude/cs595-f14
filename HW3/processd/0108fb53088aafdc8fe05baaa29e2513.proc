Dear parents, you are being lied to.

   Jennifer Raff —  March 25, 2014 — 4,552 Comments

   Standard of care.

   In light of recent outbreaks of measles and other vaccine preventable
   illnesses, and the refusal of anti-vaccination advocates to acknowledge
   the problem, I thought it was past time for this post.

   Dear parents,

   You are being lied to. The people who claim to be acting in the best
   interests of your children are putting their health and even lives at
   risk.

   They say that measles isn’t a deadly disease.
   But it is.

   They say that chickenpox isn’t that big of a deal.
   But it can be.

   They say that the flu isn’t dangerous.
   But it is.

   They say that whooping cough isn’t so bad for kids to get.
   But it is.

   They say that vaccines aren’t that effective at preventing disease.
   But 3 million children’s lives are saved every year by vaccination, and
   2 million die every year from vaccine-preventable illnesses.

   They say that “natural infection” is better than vaccination.
   But they’re wrong.

   They say that vaccines haven’t been rigorously tested for safety.
   But vaccines are subjected to a higher level of scrutiny than any other
   medicine. For example, this study tested the safety and effectiveness
   of the pneumococcal vaccine in more than 37,868 children.

   They will say that doctors won’t admit there are any side effects to
   vaccines.
   But the side effects are well known, and except in very rare cases
   quite mild.

   They say that the MMR vaccine causes autism.
   It doesn’t. (The question of whether vaccines cause autism has been
   investigated in study after study, and they all show overwhelming
   evidence that they don’t.)

   They say that thimerosal in vaccines causes autism.
   It doesn’t, and it hasn’t been in most vaccines since 2001 anyway.

   They say that the aluminum in vaccines (an adjuvant, or component of
   the vaccine designed to enhance the body’s immune response) is harmful
   to children.
   But children consume more aluminum in natural breast milk than they do
   in vaccines, and far higher levels of aluminum are needed to cause
   harm.

   They say that the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (and/or the
   “vaccine court”) proves that vaccines are harmful.
   It doesn’t.

   They say that the normal vaccine schedule is too difficult for a
   child’s immune system to cope with.
   It isn’t.

   They say that if other people’s children are vaccinated, there’s no
   need for their children to get vaccinated.

   This is one of the most despicable arguments I’ve ever heard. First of
   all, vaccines aren’t always 100% effective, so it is possible for a
   vaccinated child to still become infected if exposed to a disease.
   Worse, there are some people who can’t receive vaccinations, because
   they are immune deficient, or because they are allergic to some
   component. Those people depend upon herd immunity to protect them.
   People who choose not to vaccinate their children against infectious
   diseases are putting not only their own children at risk, but also
   other people’s children.

   They say that ‘natural’, ‘alternative’ remedies are better than
   science-based medicine.
   They aren’t.

   The truth is that vaccines are one of our greatest public health
   achievements, and one of the most important things you can do to
   protect your child.

   I can predict exactly the sort of response I will be getting from the
   anti-vaccine activists. Because they can’t argue effectively against
   the overwhelming scientific evidence about vaccines, they will say that
   I work for Big Pharma. (I don’t and never have). They will say that I’m
   not a scientist (I am), and that I’m an “Agent 666” (I don’t know what
   that is, but I’m pretty sure that I’m not one).

   None of these things are true, but they are the reflexive response by
   the anti-vaccine activists because they have no facts to back up their
   position. On some level, deep down, they must understand this, and are
   afraid of the implications, so they attack the messenger.

   Why are they lying to you? Some are doing it for profit, trying to sell
   their alternative remedies by making you afraid of science-based
   medicine. I’m sure that many others within the anti-vaccine movement
   have genuinely good intentions, and do honestly believe that vaccines
   are harmful. But as a certain astrophysicist recently said “The good
   thing about science is that it’s true whether or not you believe in
   it”. In the case of vaccine truthers, this is not a good thing. Good
   intentions will not prevent microbes from infecting and harming people,
   and the message that vaccines are dangerous is having dire
   consequences. There are outbreaks of vaccine-preventable illnesses now
   throughout the United States because of unvaccinated children.

   In only one respect is my message the same as the anti-vaccine
   activists: Educate yourself. But while they mean “Read all these
   websites that support our position”, I suggest you should learn what
   the scientific community says. Learn how the immune system works. Go
   read about the history of disease before vaccines, and talk to older
   people who grew up when polio, measles, and other diseases couldn’t be
   prevented. Go read about how vaccines are developed, and how they work.
   Read about Andrew Wakefield, and how his paper that claimed a link
   between the MMR vaccine and autism has been withdrawn, and his medical
   license has been revoked. Read the numerous, huge studies that have
   explicitly examined whether autism is caused by the vaccine…and found
   nothing. (While you’re at it, read about the ongoing research to
   determine what IS the cause—or causes —of autism, which is not helped
   by people continuing to insist that vaccines cause it).

   That may seem like a lot of work, and scientific papers can seem
   intimidating to read. But reading scientific articles is a skill that
   can be mastered. Here’s a great resource for evaluating medical
   information on the internet, and I wrote a guide for non-scientists on
   how to read and understand the scientific literature. You owe it to
   your children, and to yourself, to thoroughly investigate the issue.
   Don’t rely on what some stranger on the internet says (not even me!).
   Read the scientific studies that I linked to in this post for yourself,
   and talk to your pediatricians. Despite what the anti-vaccine community
   is telling you, you don’t need to be afraid of the vaccines. You should
   instead be afraid of what happens without them.


   Edited to add: This video is an outstanding summary of many of these
   issues. I encourage you to watch it.

     “Humans try to make sense of the world by seeing patterns. When they
     see a disease or condition that tends to appear around the time a
     child is a year or so old, as autism does, and that is also the age
     that kids get particular shots, they want to put those things
     together. Parents watch kids more carefully after they get shots.
     Sometimes they pick up on symptoms then. Just because two things
     happen at the same time doesn’t mean that one caused the other. This
     is why we need careful scientific studies.”

            So first the author decries cherry picking, and then post an
            article by Lucija Tomljenovic and Christopher Shaw published
            in an inorganic chemistry journal. Really? Are you aware that
            paper is also funded by two anti-vaccine groups, the Dwoskin
            and Katlyn Fox Family Foundations? Neither of those
            researchers are reputable.
            Then we have to only by the author’s word that the studies say
            something different. Well, gee, why didn’t she provide and
            explain the actual PubMed indexed studies by reputable
            qualified researchers that show the MMR vaccine causes more
            harm than measles, mumps and rubella. She and you can start by
            also providing documentation dated before 1990 that the MMR
            caused autism in the 1970s and 1980 in the USA coincident to
            its introduction in 1971, and being the preferred vaccine for
            the 1978 Measles Elimination Program.
            Then she wrote:

     I typed “austism” and “chelation” into the search thingy and was
     greeted with non other than a systematic review (the pinacle of the
     evidence hierarchy) that states “Multiple studies were identified
     that suggest some individuals with an ASD manifest clinical and
     behavioral improvements with chelation.”
            But she never mentioned the papers or the authors. Why is
            that? Were they by a father and son team, where one has been
            legally stripped of his medical license and the other is being
            investigating for practicing medicine without a license? They
            have made a career out of being “experts” for vaccine court
            cases using their own VAERS dumpster diving “studies”, and
            recently for convincing desperate parents to treat their
            autistic kids with chemical castration.
            She did mention “Blood levels of mercury are related to
            diagnosis of autism: a reanalysis of an important data set”,
            but that is only a quote in the abstract. You need to read the
            full paper. Plus both authors are psychologists with known
            anti-vax sentiments, not actual epidemiologists or
            biochemists. You might want to read this analysis of that
            paper, because it does not say what you think it says.
            That is the end of anything substantially evidential the
            “analysis”. The rest is just the author’s opinion. Now who is
            the author and what are her credentials? Well check the “About
            Mel” link we learn: “Hi, my name is Mel Hopper Koppelman and I
            am a registered Acupuncturist and a practitioner of
            Integrative Medicine.”
            So this is a person who is not a real medical care
            practitioner who actually thinks sticking needles in the body
            works. I’d be interested to learn if she uses bare hands or
            actually uses gloves and properly sterilized needles.Obviously
            she was not aware that it takes a very long time to recover
            from amoebic dysentery, and she could have avoided it if she
            had boiled or distilled the water she drank in India. Anyone
            who has traveled and understands germ theory would know this,
            the New Dehli house my brother lived in had a distiller for
            the water as standard kitchen equipment.

                 Hi Chris,
                 Thank you for taking the time to read my post.
                 If my post had been intending to make the case against
                 vaccines, then you would be right about my cherry-picking
                 articles (which I fully disclose that I’m doing) and your
                 suggestions for further analysis would be relevant.
                 However, my post is about the deliberate
                 misrepresentation of research by this author to prove a
                 point. The articles that I “cherry pick” are merely
                 showing that, unlike what the author states, evidence to
                 the contrary exists. I’m pleased that you are capable of
                 a more nuanced view, which is to acknowledge that they do
                 exist. Assessing their quality is a separate matter. I
                 took umbrage that a woman with a PhD did not seem to
                 appreciate the difference between the total absence of
                 evidence to the contrary and poor quality evidence to the
                 contrary.
                 Thank you for pointing out that I have forgotten the
                 links to those articles, I will add them this afternoon.
                 Your suggestion that somehow my being an acupuncturist
                 precludes me from being research literate is rather ad
                 hominem and incorrect (I’ve earned a BSc and an MSc).
                 Jennifer Raff isn’t a “real medical care practitioner” –
                 does that make her arguments about vaccines any more or
                 less sound? Personally, I don’t think so.
                 I’m really pleased to hear that your brother had a water
                 distiller in New Delhi. My accommodation was rather more
                 basic as I was volunteering in an orphanage but I can
                 assure you that the amoeba’s weren’t selective for
                 acupuncturists; we were all drinking bottled and
                 sterilised water, but even the real doctors that I was
                 volunteering with got sick too.

                      “However, my post is about the deliberate
                      misrepresentation of research by this author to
                      prove a point.”
                      Which you failed to point out with relevant
                      citations. You can correct that by answering these
                      two points:
                      “provide and explain the actual PubMed indexed
                      studies by reputable qualified researchers that show
                      the MMR vaccine causes more harm than measles, mumps
                      and rubella.”
                      And: “providing documentation dated before 1990 that
                      the MMR caused autism in the 1970s and 1980 in the
                      USA coincident to its introduction in 1971, and
                      being the preferred vaccine for the 1978 Measles
                      Elimination Program.”
                      You can also provide the PubMed indexed studies by
                      reputable qualified researchers that thimerosal is a
                      cause of autism, and that chelation is effective.
                      You should make sure that the authors have the
                      relevant background and have not had their medical
                      licenses revoked. That eliminates papers by the
                      Geiers, DeSoto, Hitlan, Tomljenovic, Goldman,
                      Blaxill, etc.
                      Even if Dr. Raff is not a medical doctor, the
                      references she posted are by qualified researchers.
                      Just click on the links provided and then explain
                      why we should not trust those researchers. Prove you
                      are a capable of analyzing scientific documentation
                      by providing some yourself.

                           Chris, I respectfully disagree. Had I claimed
                           that vaccines cause autism (which I haven’t)
                           then a request to back that claim up with
                           reference to the research would be appropriate.
                           However, I’ve only pointed out that Dr Raff’s
                           piece makes a series of black and white claims
                           about “the truth” about vaccines and then she
                           proceeds to back up these claims using mostly
                           opinion pieces, un-referenced blog articles and
                           newspaper articles. When she does use
                           peer-reviewed research, it’s often of a design
                           that isn’t appropriate to support the claim
                           that she’s making.
                           If you’re itching for a fight about vaccines,
                           I’m sure there are plenty of people on the
                           internet to pick a fight with. My points were
                           about the mis-leading use of the evidence-base
                           to support an argument. As Dr Raff has a PhD
                           and has written pieces on research literacy, I
                           have assumed that this mis-use was intentional,
                           which is why I decided to write about it.

                                the “opinion” pieces by Dr. Offit were all

                      Your protestations are hollow; admitting that you
                      are cherry-picking evidence does not make it a sound
                      or serious attempt to come to terms with the
                      totality of the evidence.
                      I do substantial research into various irrational
                      ideologies: Bigfoot hunters, creationists,
                      UFOologists, anti-vaxers, crystal healers,
                      homeopaths, and yes, chiropractors (at least some of
                      them). No matter how one-sided the overall evidence
                      is, there is always, always, always “poor quality
                      evidence to the contrary.” Whenever people divide
                      along ideological lines, a division you are actively
                      promoting, the minority will generate its own
                      evidence. It doesn’t make the minority position
                      right or reasonable. Only substantial evidence would
                      do that, which the anti-vax position hasn’t been
                      able to find–that’s why you had to scratch up such
                      dubious research to support your scaremongering.
                      Highlighting that exceptionally poor quality
                      evidence and pretending that it rises to the level
                      of a serious rebuttal to the totality of the
                      evidence is indeed an anti-vax position.

                           Colin, reading your comment, I can’t help but
                           get the impression that you haven’t actually
                           read my post but are taking my comment to Chris
                           out of context? I have highlighted that
                           contrary evidence exists, not because I have
                           attempted to equate it to evidence to the
                           contrary, only because Ms Raff’s post on
                           several occasions says that no evidence to the
                           contrary exists and goes through the mock
                           exercise of referencing articles to support
                           this claim. I was merely pointing out that this
                           assertion was false.
                           All I have done is a critical appraisal of her
                           article using widely accepted research methods.
                           Can you please provide an example of how I have
                           engaged in scaremongering? Again, I think you
                           can find plenty of examples of this on the
                           internet and your comments would be more
                           relevantly addressed to people actively
                           engaging in that practice. I have only pointed
                           out that she’s supported her claims about what
                           the scientific research shows using sources
                           squarely outside the realm of scientific
                           research.

                                “I have highlighted that contrary evidence
                                exists, not because I have attempted to

                                Except your references were not quality
                                research, as I pointed out. Not all
                                “evidence” is equal. You need to learn how
                                to tell the difference, which is why Dr.
                                Raff has provided some articles about
                                evaluating studies.
                                I have also asked you to provide that
                                evidence to the contrary that are from
                                reputable qualified researchers. You have
                                not done that.
                                Also, Dr. Raff has a PhD, you might want
                                to use the proper honorific.

                                You are incorrect; I have read your post.
                                It is a good, if uninspired, example of
                                the “just asking questions” school of
                                rhetoric: pretending not to hold a
                                particular position while using rhetorical
                                questions to advocate for that position.
                                It is often distinguished by the nature of
                                the questions, which have little
                                resemblance to the sorts of things people
                                ask when they are actually interested in
                                determining the truth of a difficult
                                question.
                                When someone says that no evidence to the
                                contrary exists, they do not mean–and this
                                is obvious to any native speaker of the
                                English (or any) language–that literally
                                no one, anywhere, has taken the contrary
                                position. (Technically, simply the fact
                                that one person makes a claim is evidence
                                for that claim. Just not very good
                                evidence.) What they typically mean,
                                particularly in a scientific context, is
                                that the balance of evidence is extremely
                                one-sided. That’s certainly the case here,
                                where you had to dive into some very shaky
                                research, and even shakier rhetoric, to
                                support your anti-vax scaremongering.
                                “All I have done is a critical appraisal
                                of her article using widely accepted
                                research methods.”
                                No, this isn’t true. A critical appraisal
                                would involve critically measuring the
                                strength of the two positions you are
                                holding in equal esteem: that vaccines are
                                safe and effective, and that they are not.
                                But rather than analyzing the strength of
                                the various positions, you’ve identified
                                that there are two camps and are insisting
                                that they be treated with equal
                                seriousness.
                                Are you aware that a scientist published a
                                paper purporting to sequence the Sasquatch
                                genome? If another scientist said,
                                “There’s no evidence that Bigfoot exists,”
                                would you jump up and claim that they were
                                abusing science? Probably not, because you
                                aren’t trying to convince people that
                                Bigfoot exists. You’ve done exactly that
                                here because you are, despite your
                                protestations, trying to convince people
                                that the scientific consensus regarding
                                vaccines is not a consensus.
                                “Can you please provide an example of how
                                I have engaged in scaremongering?”
                                Yes. For example, you purport to be
                                examining the question of whether science
                                shows a causal link between vaccines and
                                autism. Dr. Raff linked to a great deal of
                                science showing the consensus that it does
                                not. You “hopped over to Google Scholar
                                and typed in the words “vaccines” and
                                “autism”,” then credulously reported the
                                first anti-vax paper you found. That is
                                not a serious or reasonable attempt to
                                learn the truth–it’s (as you admitted here
                                in another comment) cherry-picking. In
                                fact, if you do just a little bit more
                                Googling, you’ll find that paper has been
                                thoroughly debunked. It’s not on the same
                                level as the serious science done by
                                disinterested experts–it’s an advocacy
                                piece, much like yours, although the
                                authors have better credentials. Holding
                                that article up as a false equivalent to
                                the overwhelming body of scientific
                                research is scaremongering. It’s an
                                attempt to persuade your readers that this
                                is an unsettled scientific question, when
                                in fact–like the existence of Bigfoot–it
                                has been thoroughly investigated and put
                                to rest.
                                Another example is your pretense that
                                vaccines are not adequately studied for
                                safety because many vaccine trials use
                                vaccinated controls. This is also not a
                                serious concern; the reasons for using
                                vaccinated controls are obvious and well
                                documented. You can even Google it! (Try
                                “clinical equipoise” if your results
                                aren’t satisfactory.) It does not mean
                                that vaccines have been inadequately
                                studied. Moreover, you disregarded the
                                vast body of pre- and post-licensure
                                safety studies. Why? Because your goal is
                                not to determine whether vaccines are
                                adequately studied (another question
                                regarded as settled by the professional
                                and expert communities) but to “just ask
                                questions” that will scare your
                                readers–and generate pageviews.
                                A third example is your claim that “Dr
                                Raff uses this document to support the
                                claim that there is no evidence for a link
                                between the MMR vaccine and autism… Wow, I
                                don’t even know what to say. What the
                                report says is so incredibly different
                                from how Jennifer summarised it, which is
                                frankly insulting to the intelligence of
                                her readers.” You should have known what
                                to say! You should have said, “That
                                document says exactly what Dr. Raff said
                                it did: ‘there is no evidence for a link
                                between the MMR vaccine and autism.'”
                                Please reread the excerpt you pulled from
                                that document. You casually and
                                misleadingly tried to recast the report’s
                                statement that it could not definitively
                                prove that the MMR vaccine never caused
                                autism in any child as a statement that
                                there was evidence of such a link–again,
                                scaremongering.
                                A fourth example is statement that you
                                “typed “austism” and “chelation” into the
                                search thingy” and found that chelation
                                can be an effective treatment for autism.
                                I find it ironic, I should say, that you
                                accuse Dr. Raff of “abusing” science when
                                your own approach is “the search thingy.”
                                In this case, you failed to cite the
                                source of your evidence. Is it because you
                                didn’t want people to type the author’s
                                name into “the search thingy?” They would
                                learn that he is the subject of a lawsuit
                                regarding the alleged practice of using
                                tests designed to mislead parents into
                                thinking their children are poisoned by
                                heavy metals and subsequently prescribing
                                chelation over the phone, without an
                                phone. It is, allegedly, a “big business.”
                                A reasonable person might pause and think,
                                perhaps this Google result, being the
                                research of a fringe scientist making
                                money off of the fringe treatment his own
                                research, is not quite on the same level
                                as the mainstream academic and clinical
                                consensus–especially since it runs counter
                                to that consensus and is supported by no
                                disinterested research. But not you–you
                                reported it without “just asking
                                questions.” You save those for the
                                conclusions you don’t like.

                                     Could you please address Rina Marie’s
                                     follow up article. She seems to make
                                     some very convincing statements. As
                                     well, the website
                                     “adventuresinautism” also refers to
                                     84 journal articles that link autism
                                     to vaccinations. What can we say
                                     about these?

                                     I’m not certain what article you
                                     mean. The one where she says that
                                     measles isn’t a big deal because only
                                     sixty-something kids have been
                                     hospitalized because of measles? I
                                     think I have a different standard for
                                     concern than she does–sixty-something
                                     kids in the hospital seems like kind
                                     of a big deal to me.
                                     I don’t have the time, training, or
                                     experience to review and understand
                                     those 80 papers. (That’s true of the
                                     blogger there too; she’s obviously
                                     not exercising any quality control
                                     but rather scraping abstracts for
                                     anything that sounds vaguely
                                     supportive of her ideology.) Those
                                     who do find them extremely poor
                                     evidence of the proposition that
                                     vaccines cause autism.
                                     I’m more persuaded by the review of
                                     expert bodies like the Institute of
                                     Medicine, a division of the National
                                     Academies. It reviewed the entire
                                     body of literature and found the
                                     evidence does not support the
                                     supposed vaccines-autism connection.
                                     As I said above, whenever there is an
                                     ideological division, the minority is
                                     heavily incentivized to create
                                     evidence supporting their position.
                                     It happens with UFO stories, it
                                     happened with the JFK assassination,
                                     it happens with creationism, and it
                                     happens with vaccines.
                                     The test is not, “Has someone ever
                                     said something in a journal that
                                     supports my position?” The test is,
                                     “What do the people with the greatest
                                     access to and understanding of the
                                     data think on balance?” It’s been
                                     asked by government agencies like the
                                     WHO and CDC. It’s been asked by
                                     non-governmental agencies like the
                                     IOM and MSF. It’s been asked by
                                     academics, clinicians, and
                                     economists. It’s even been asked by
                                     courts of law. The answer, for anyone
                                     who sets out to learn the truth
                                     rather than create support for their
                                     own beliefs, is that the experts
                                     overwhelmingly reject the
                                     vaccine-autism connection.

                                     It was discussed here, with Rina

                                     blog is the source for the material I

                                     You are welcome, I am glad to help.
                                     Ms. Ditz and some others analyzed
                                     through those papers on a Facebook
                                     page. I am glad she hosted them where
                                     others could see them.
                                     I have trudged through an earlier
                                     list, so I am glad that others took
                                     this on. While this is an interest to
                                     me because I have an adult child who
                                     not only has suffered from actual
                                     diseases before the vaccines for them
                                     was available, he has other health
                                     concerns that require community

                                     But even I have my limits of
                                     fortitude. One way to avoid
                                     additional time sinks to to stay away
                                     from Facebook and to never comment on
                                     news articles.

                                     Whoops, I apologize. You did cite the
                                     Rossignol paper after all.

                                     I am not anti-vax (or pro-vax) – I
                                     merely object to the use of false
                                     dichotomies to artificially
                                     oversimplify a complex issue.
                                     My references were merely used to
                                     point out that Dr Raff had
                                     over-simplified the issues; as such,
                                     they were appropriately used.
                                     Critical appraisal of papers can only
                                     happen when we acknowledge that they
                                     exist.
                                     Take safety – people are asking are
                                     vaccines safe? (And Dr Raff answers
                                     this with a simple “yes, they are,
                                     look at this single study”).
                                     Answering this type of closed
                                     question with a simple ‘yes’ or ‘no’
                                     is simply not supported anywhere in
                                     the research literature or in
                                     reality. Vaccines can and do cause
                                     serious adverse events. So does
                                     infection by vaccine-preventable
                                     illness. The only reasonable question
                                     about vaccine safety is “How safe are
                                     vaccines?” and we need to be clear
                                     about how we’re defining and
                                     measuring safety.
                                     a) Safety is relative, so a study can
                                     only (indirectly) evaluate if one
                                     intervention is safer (using
                                     particular outcome measures) than
                                     another. The safety studies that I’ve
                                     come across do not use an
                                     unvaccinated control group. Please
                                     explain to me how using vaccinated
                                     controls as a comparator answers the
                                     question of the relative safety of
                                     vaccinating vs not vaccinating.
                                     And the number of safety studies on
                                     the combination of vaccines in the
                                     current vaccination schedule in the
                                     United States is exactly 0. So on
                                     exactly what can you base the
                                     assertion that the current vaccine
                                     schedule is safe for long-term health
                                     outcomes?
                                     b) Outcome measures – these are
                                     indirect proxies of safety and it’s
                                     important to be specific about these
                                     – the most common measure of ‘safety’
                                     in clinical vaccine trials is how
                                     often that disease is caused in the
                                     recipient by the vaccine – most
                                     often, other concerns around vaccine
                                     safety (atopia, autoimmunity, adverse
                                     reactions to adjuvants) are not
                                     measured. And timescale is an issue –
                                     are safety outcomes only measured in
                                     the short-term or are long-term
                                     health effects taken into account?
                                     It’s entirely possible that the
                                     short-term and long-term safety
                                     profiles for the current vaccination
                                     schedule are different.
                                     c) Vaccine safety exists on a
                                     spectrum – support for this assertion
                                     comes from the simple fact that
                                     vaccines are a heterogenous group of
                                     heterogenous compounds – in trials,
                                     some are found to be ‘safer’ than
                                     others
                                     d) Combinations of vaccines – as
                                     stated above, the safety of the
                                     current vaccination schedule in the
                                     US has simply not been tested by
                                     anyone and the National Academies
                                     report concludes that the
                                     administration of multiple vaccines
                                     increases the risk of allergies and
                                     autoimmune disease. Are you really
                                     saying that you are totally confident
                                     that all vaccines are completely safe
                                     in any combination and in any number?
                                     (And that it’s unreasonable or
                                     “ideological” to simply ask the
                                     question of why you think you know
                                     this?)
                                     f) How is the study population
                                     defined? – Due to biochemical
                                     individuality, individuals respond
                                     uniquely to vaccines. How people
                                     respond is determined by an
                                     intersection of factors, including
                                     genetics, nutrition status, toxic
                                     burden, weight and other factors. The
                                     current vaccination schedule is based
                                     solely on age and takes none of this
                                     into account. One weakness of large
                                     scale trials that are not adequately
                                     segmented is that they are not
                                     sensitive enough to detect adverse
                                     reactions in sub-populations.
                                     In sum, there are a number of complex
                                     factors that need to be weighed to
                                     rationally discuss vaccine safety.
                                     And when we are talking about vaccine
                                     safety, we need to define what we
                                     mean (what are the outcome measures
                                     we are looking at, what are the
                                     comparators, and who is the
                                     population). To answer in the simple
                                     affirmative (or negative) without
                                     acknowledging these issues is simply
                                     unsupported by the scientific
                                     literature.
                                     So going back to Dr Raff’s piece and
                                     my response to it: if we take, for
                                     example, her argument that vaccines
                                     are safe (a simple ‘yes’ answer) and
                                     to support this assertion, her
                                     evidence is that a single large scale
                                     trial found pneumococcal vaccine
                                     caused fewer cases of vaccine-induced
                                     disease than the meningococcus
                                     vaccine, my point is NOT that
                                     vaccines are not safe
                                     (scare-mongering). I’m merely
                                     pointing out that the evidence she is
                                     presenting is woefully inadequate to
                                     reasonably and responsibly answer
                                     this question in the simple
                                     affirmative. This report answers the
                                     question “which of these two vaccines
                                     caused more cases of vaccine induced
                                     invasive illness” (and had a few
                                     secondary outcome measures) but it
                                     leaves all of these other questions
                                     unanswered. Suggesting that it says
                                     anything but that is irresponsible.
                                     Again, my main objection is the
                                     creation of this false dichotomy.
                                     There are many ways to measure safety
                                     and there are enough reasonable
                                     concerns that have been raised –
                                     according to the Department of
                                     Health, the Vaccine Injury
                                     Compensation Program has paid out
                                     $2.7 billion in compensation for
                                     vaccine injuries
                                     (http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecom… and
                                     the National Academies report raises
                                     reasonable concerns.
                                     As such, asking questions that
                                     acknowledge the complexity of the
                                     issues around vaccines is a
                                     reasonable thing to do. Claiming that
                                     the scientific literature supports a
                                     simple “yes” or “no” answer to the
                                     question “Are vaccines safe?” is
                                     completely irresponsible.

                                     (I’m copying the reply I left at your
                                     blog, because it looks like you
                                     posted the same comment there–please
                                     let me know if I missed a change in
                                     this one.)
                                     My references were merely used to
                                     point out that Dr Raff had
                                     over-simplified the issues; as such,
                                     they were appropriately used.
                                     This is a bizarre and hypocritical
                                     assertion. You are using risible
                                     papers, both debunked and obviously
                                     written to generate a commercial
                                     advantage, to claim there is some
                                     sort of equivalence between anti-vax
                                     and pro-vax research. You are
                                     oversimplifying the issue to an
                                     absurd extent. In other words,
                                     whether chelation treats autism is
                                     not an open question. You had to
                                     dredge up a poor-quality, biased
                                     paper to make it appear as it if is.
                                     If you were actually treating the
                                     issues as they are, instead of
                                     oversimplifying them to make your
                                     point appear reasonable, you would
                                     have come to terms with the balance
                                     of the research rather than
                                     cherrypicking papers that support
                                     your preexisting beliefs.
                                     As for whether Dr. Raff is
                                     oversimplifying, I’ll make the same
                                     point here I did there. A researcher
                                     in Texas claims to have sequenced the
                                     Sasquatch genome, and published a
                                     paper with her results. If a
                                     zoologist wrote that there’s no
                                     scientific evidence that Bigfoot
                                     exists, would you call her a liar?
                                     Probably not, because your ulterior
                                     motive is not to increase belief in
                                     Bigfoot. But you’re an antivaxer, so
                                     you jumped on an opportunity to (a)
                                     generate page hits and (b) make it
                                     appear, falsely, as if the safety or
                                     efficacy of vaccines are seriously
                                     questioned in the expert community.
                                     In other words, Dr. Raff is assessing
                                     the entire body of research. You’re
                                     scraping the bottom of the barrel to
                                     present a distorted picture of that
                                     research, using cherrypicked research
                                     and fiery rhetoric. Only one of you
                                     is oversimplifying, and it’s not the
                                     one with the PhD.
                                     Critical appraisal of papers can only
                                     happen when we acknowledge that they
                                     exist.
                                     I would take this statement more
                                     seriously if you showed any
                                     inclination to actually performing
                                     such an appraisal. Nevertheless, I
                                     take your point to be that no zoology
                                     conference should leave Bigfoot
                                     research off of the schedule without
                                     first stopping to acknowledge the one
                                     paper that concluded that Bigfoot
                                     exists. I disagree, and I think I’m
                                     not alone in that.
                                     You keep referring to my “ideological
                                     position” – my only position is
                                     against asking and answering closed
                                     (yes/no) questions to create a false
                                     dichotomy on issues that are complex.
                                     This is a rhetorical tactic known as
                                     “just asking questions”. Your
                                     ideological position is obvious from
                                     the context and content of your
                                     writing. You aren’t happy that the
                                     overwhelming consensus among experts
                                     is that vaccines are safe and
                                     effective, so you went hunting in the
                                     far fringe of anti-vax research and
                                     medical woo to find a few papers you
                                     could hang your hat on. Then you held
                                     them up as equivalent to the body of
                                     research overall, and serious reviews
                                     by bodies like the IOM and WHO.
                                     If you were trying to ask open-ended
                                     questions, you would be asking things
                                     like what the balance of research
                                     says or why it says what it does.
                                     Instead, you created exactly what you
                                     pretend to dislike: a “closed …
                                     question.” Here, you used terrible
                                     research and pretended it was equal
                                     to the body of serious science in
                                     order to, as you say, “create a false
                                     dichotomy on issues that are
                                     complex.”
                                     In other words, a reader of Dr.
                                     Raff’s piece who didn’t do any
                                     further research would walk away with
                                     an accurate impression of the overall
                                     body of research: vaccines are safe
                                     and effective. A reader of your piece
                                     who didn’t do any further research
                                     would walk away deceived, believing
                                     falsely that there is serious
                                     research finding that vaccines cause
                                     autism or that chelation treats it.
                                     You are deceiving your readers with
                                     the rhetorical tactic of false
                                     balance.
                                     Take safety – people are asking are
                                     vaccines safe? (And Dr Raff answers
                                     this with a simple “yes, they are,
                                     look at this single study”).
                                     Are seatbelts safe? Sometimes they
                                     kill people by strangulation. And
                                     yet, if you asked a researcher that
                                     question, “yes” would be an accurate
                                     and reasonable answer. They could
                                     also say, “Yes, but very rarely they
                                     hurt people,” because it is always
                                     possible to give a more in-depth
                                     answer. But to a reasonable person
                                     looking at the totality of evidence,
                                     “yes” is an accurate and legitimate
                                     answer—whether the products in
                                     question are vaccines or seatbelts.
                                     The safety studies that I’ve come
                                     across do not use an unvaccinated
                                     control group. Please explain to me
                                     how using vaccinated controls as a
                                     comparator answers the question of
                                     the relative safety of vaccinating vs
                                     not vaccinating.
                                     If you don’t understand this, you
                                     might consider being more humble
                                     about your angry denunciations of
                                     others and do more reading yourself.
                                     First, check your assumptions—the
                                     idea that vaccines aren’t tested
                                     against a neutral placebo is an
                                     anti-vax talking point. Use your
                                     “search thingy” to ask the question
                                     rather than assuming the conclusion
                                     most convenient to your beliefs. (For
                                     example, in the first page of search
                                     results for “vaccine placebo saline”
                                     you’ll find research reporting the
                                     results of a Gardasil trial that
                                     involved both a saline placebo and an
                                     aluminum adjuvant placebo—two things
                                     anti-vaxers often claim are never
                                     done.) Saline placebos are less
                                     common in vaccine trials than with
                                     many other pharmaceuticals, largely
                                     because of basic medical ethics. The
                                     Declaration of Helsinki prohibits
                                     researchers from adversely affecting
                                     the health of their subjects, and
                                     thus from using a saline placebo when
                                     the existing vaccine is known to be
                                     safe and effective.
                                     Vaccines go through a variety of
                                     trials. The early stages do test
                                     whether the vaccine alone is safe.
                                     Later trials test whether it is safer
                                     or more effective than the status quo
                                     vaccine. You can’t—and I mean that
                                     researchers are not permitted to do
                                     this—deprive a test group of the
                                     status quo vaccine for the sake of
                                     research. It would be an appalling
                                     breach of ethics. (Did you study
                                     medical ethics in acupuncture school?
                                     I’m not trying to be snarky, I’m
                                     honestly curious. Since acupuncture
                                     is a placebo, I’m not certain whether
                                     there’s any focus on this kind of
                                     conduct.) Even after a vaccine is
                                     approved its safety is tested through
                                     post-licensure trials and population
                                     studies.
                                     I hope you can understand that it’s
                                     not just vaccines that are tested
                                     this way. When pharma companies
                                     develop a new antibiotic, they don’t
                                     let a few dozen people suffer
                                     untreated staph infections to create
                                     a control group. The fact that drugs
                                     are tested against the standard of
                                     care, rather than unmedicated
                                     subjects, does not prevent
                                     researchers from testing the safety
                                     of the drug.
                                     And the number of safety studies on
                                     the combination of vaccines in the
                                     current vaccination schedule in the
                                     United States is exactly 0. So on
                                     exactly what can you base the
                                     assertion that the current vaccine
                                     schedule is safe for long-term health
                                     outcomes?
                                     I like to go back to the Institute of
                                     Medicine’s study, Childhood
                                     Immunization Schedule and Safety:
                                     Stakeholder Concerns, Scientific
                                     Evidence, and Future Studies: “This
                                     report is the most comprehensive
                                     examination of the immunization
                                     schedule to date. The IOM committee
                                     uncovered no evidence of major safety
                                     concerns associated with adherence to
                                     the childhood immunization schedule.
                                     Should signals arise that there may
                                     be need for investigation, however,
                                     the report offers a framework for
                                     conducting safety research using
                                     existing or new data collection
                                     systems.”
                                     The immunization schedule has been
                                     studied, and there is no evidence of
                                     major safety concerns. Even anti-vax
                                     leading lights like Dr. Sears have
                                     been unable to uncover real evidence
                                     of problems with it. If such problems
                                     do come to light, there is a system
                                     in place for detecting them and
                                     resolving them (as has been done in
                                     the past). I’m sorry to say that
                                     system does not really include
                                     bloggers; it tends to rely more
                                     heavily on experts who can actually
                                     engage with the data and contribute
                                     to the research, rather than echoing
                                     ideological talking points like, “But
                                     vaccines aren’t tested!”
                                     the most common measure of ‘safety’
                                     in clinical vaccine trials is how
                                     often that disease is caused in the
                                     recipient by the vaccine – most
                                     often, other concerns around vaccine
                                     safety (atopia, autoimmunity, adverse
                                     reactions to adjuvants) are not
                                     measured
                                     This isn’t true. How did you even
                                     come to this conclusion? I suspect by
                                     reading anti-vax blogs; certainly not
                                     by actually searching for adjuvant
                                     studies—you would have found many of
                                     them. Vaccine adjuvants are well
                                     studied, both by themselves and in
                                     situ as vaccine ingredients.
                                     It’s entirely possible that the
                                     short-term and long-term safety
                                     profiles for the current vaccination
                                     schedule are different. . . . Vaccine
                                     safety exists on a spectrum – support
                                     for this assertion comes from the
                                     simple fact that vaccines are a
                                     heterogenous group of heterogenous
                                     compounds – in trials, some are found
                                     to be ‘safer’ than others
                                     It’s entirely possible that the
                                     short-term and long-term safety
                                     profiles of everything are different.
                                     But in the absence of evidence for a
                                     serious concern, you’re just
                                     scaremongering.
                                     the safety of the current vaccination
                                     schedule in the US has simply not
                                     been tested by anyone and the
                                     National Academies report concludes
                                     that the administration of multiple
                                     vaccines increases the risk of
                                     allergies and autoimmune disease. Are
                                     you really saying that you are
                                     totally confident that all vaccines
                                     are completely safe in any
                                     combination and in any number? (And
                                     that it’s unreasonable or
                                     “ideological” to simply ask the
                                     question of why you think you know
                                     this?)
                                     It isn’t necessary to run a giant
                                     trial of the specific combination of
                                     vaccines currently used when
                                     population studies show no particular
                                     cause for concern. It would be
                                     impossible, probably; the schedule
                                     changes too often to run a giant
                                     trial every time. It’s easy enough to
                                     test its safety by, for example,
                                     looking to see whether adverse events
                                     are correlated to changes
                                     in/adoptions of the schedule.
                                     I’m not a vaccine researcher, or even
                                     a scientist. I’m a layperson—we have
                                     that in common. I’m nevertheless
                                     confident that the vaccine schedule
                                     is safe because those people who are
                                     experts are essentially unanimous on
                                     the subject. Even anti-vaxers who
                                     have tremendous incentives to prove
                                     that their doom-and-gloom
                                     pronouncements are right, and the
                                     resources to test their theories,
                                     have been unable to generate any
                                     convincing evidence that the schedule
                                     is dangerous.
                                     In other words, I’m confident that
                                     vaccines are safe for the same reason
                                     I’m confident that antibiotics,
                                     seatbelts, household wiring,
                                     computers, cellphones, moderate
                                     exercise, and even acupuncture are
                                     safe. I’m an expert in none of them,
                                     but the people who have studied them
                                     have concluded overwhelmingly that
                                     they’re safe, and I have no
                                     particular reason to believe those
                                     conclusions are the result of a giant
                                     shadowy conspiracy. (Nor, and I speak
                                     as someone who is experienced in
                                     detecting and litigating complex
                                     fraud, do I believe such a conspiracy
                                     would be remotely possible.)
                                     One weakness of large scale trials
                                     that are not adequately segmented is
                                     that they are not sensitive enough to
                                     detect adverse reactions in
                                     sub-populations.
                                     You have yet to persuade me that
                                     vaccine trials aren’t adequately
                                     segmented, or that such problems
                                     wouldn’t be detected in population
                                     studies. If you were to cite someone
                                     with experience and expertise in the
                                     field who shares your concerns, I’d
                                     be interested in reading their take.
                                     Again, my main objection is the
                                     creation of this false dichotomy.
                                     Again, they hypocrisy of your
                                     complaint is staggering. You have
                                     been working hard to create exactly
                                     the kind of false dichotomy you’re
                                     pretending to oppose, by elevating
                                     terrible research to the level of the
                                     scientific consensus and pretending
                                     there are two equally valid positions
                                     to be assessed. There aren’t, and I
                                     think you know that—if there were a
                                     real dichotomy, as you pretend, you
                                     wouldn’t have to dig so deep to find
                                     paper with which to wrap your
                                     ideology.
                                     There are many ways to measure safety
                                     and there are enough reasonable
                                     concerns that have been raised –
                                     according to the Department of
                                     Health, the Vaccine Injury
                                     Compensation Program has paid out
                                     $2.7 billion in compensation for
                                     vaccine injuries
                                     This was the wrong argument to make.
                                     I’m an attorney, and I’ve studied the
                                     NVICP to some extent. You can find my

                                     Metaphors. $2.7 billion sounds like a
                                     lot of money, but to anyone familiar
                                     with large-scale litigation the
                                     interesting thing about that number
                                     is that it’s so small. It’s the
                                     amount the court has awarded over
                                     decades, in which many, many millions
                                     of vaccines were given, in the
                                     context of an extraordinarily
                                     plaintiff-friendly system. Plaintiffs
                                     alleging table injuries don’t even
                                     have to prove that the vaccine caused
                                     their injury—just showing up and
                                     proving that they were vaccinated,
                                     then had the injury, is enough to win
                                     compensation. In that kind of
                                     environment, over many years, with
                                     millions and millions of vaccines
                                     administered, a $2.7 billion pot is
                                     evidence that vaccines really are
                                     extraordinarily safe. (You could also
                                     look at how few claims are filed,
                                     despite the plaintiff-friendly terms
                                     and the fact that the government pays
                                     for plaintiffs’ lawyers—it’s further
                                     evidence that even with the incentive
                                     and resources to generate evidence
                                     that vaccines are dangerous, the
                                     facts just aren’t cooperating.)
                                     Manufacturers of any other product
                                     would kill for the safety record of
                                     vaccines.
                                     As such, asking questions that
                                     acknowledge the complexity of the
                                     issues around vaccines is a
                                     reasonable thing to do. Claiming that
                                     the scientific literature supports a
                                     simple “yes” or “no” answer to the
                                     question “Are vaccines safe?” is
                                     completely irresponsible.
                                     It’s no more irresponsible than
                                     saying that yes, antibiotics are
                                     safe, or yes, airplanes are safe, or
                                     yes, cellphones are safe, or yes,
                                     ballroom dancing is safe. All of
                                     those things, like vaccines, hurt
                                     people from time to time. But a
                                     reasonable person actually asking
                                     serious questions about how safe
                                     those things are would be perfectly
                                     comfortable saying yes, they’re safe.
                                     It’s a long post, so let me repeat
                                     something I wrote earlier: you are
                                     creating the very false dichotomy you
                                     complain about. A reader of Dr.
                                     Raff’s piece who didn’t do any
                                     further research would walk away with
                                     an accurate impression of the overall
                                     body of research: vaccines are safe
                                     and effective. A reader of your piece
                                     who didn’t do any further research
                                     would walk away deceived, believing
                                     falsely that there is serious
                                     research finding that vaccines cause
                                     autism or that chelation treats it.

                                     You are conflating how Dr Raff
                                     supported her argument with what she
                                     was actually arguing. The issue that
                                     I initially took with Dr Raff’s blog
                                     post is the way she used references
                                     to support her conclusions. I may be
                                     a lay person in the field of vaccine
                                     research (as is Dr Raff, to the best
                                     of knowledge) but I have
                                     post-graduate training in research
                                     methods and two research degrees. You
                                     keep arguing that her use of
                                     references to support her statements
                                     was valid because you agree with her
                                     conclusions. These two things are
                                     really unrelated. If she had used
                                     identical methods to support a
                                     conclusion that you happened to not
                                     agree with, this would be much more
                                     apparent to you.
                                     Using your Big Foot example, we both
                                     agree that Big Foot does not exist.
                                     But that does not preclude someone
                                     with a PhD from writing a blog post
                                     which seeks to support the conclusion
                                     that Big Foot does not exist but does
                                     so by inappropriately using the
                                     scientific literature (or using the
                                     non-scientific literature while
                                     implying that it is scientific
                                     literature) to support their claims.
                                     And, then to continue, if someone
                                     comes along as says: “Wait a minute,
                                     an unreferenced blog post isn’t
                                     appropriate evidence in a scientific
                                     discussion about whether or not Big
                                     Foot exists. And you can’t use single
                                     studies to summarise the evidence
                                     base” (unless you do so in context)
                                     and then a wave of hate comes down on
                                     that person because pointing out the
                                     mis-use of the research to support
                                     that Big Foot Does not Exist is being
                                     equated to saying that Big Foot does
                                     exist.
                                     All that having been said, now that I
                                     have read a bit more about it, I do
                                     have my concerns about the long-term
                                     adverse effects of the current
                                     vaccine schedule. But I’ll get to
                                     that in a minute.

                                     appropriately reference a Cochrane
                                     Systematic Review (like any study,
                                     not infallible, but indeed the
                                     appropriate study design to answer a
                                     question about what the literature as
                                     a whole shows). The Cochrane study
                                     unsurprisingly concludes that when
                                     pharmaceutical companies fund their
                                     own trials, the results are more
                                     likely to find that the drugs are
                                     safe and effective than when funding
                                     comes from other sources (Lundh
                                     2012).
                                     The National Academies Press Report
                                     I’ve taken a skim through this and
                                     here are some initial concerns.
                                     Looking at the chapter on Allergy and
                                     Asthma, a couple of things jump out.
                                     First, the authors write in the
                                     intro: “it is necessary to have a
                                     detailed understanding of the
                                     relationship between allergic disease
                                     and vaccination, because the
                                     effectiveness of the immunization
                                     program may be adversely impacted by
                                     a perception that vaccination is
                                     harmful.” So the authors have stated
                                     that the purpose of reviewing the
                                     literature is to disprove any
                                     relationship between vaccines and
                                     asthma, and not as one could only
                                     hope, to find out if any relationship
                                     exists.
                                     Then, the authors write: “Though the
                                     committee did not undertake a formal
                                     systematic review, the quality of
                                     individual articles was judged by the
                                     validity of the study design, the
                                     method by which the research was
                                     conducted, and the transparency of
                                     methods.” And this makes sense; if
                                     you want to summarise the literature
                                     in a way to support a given
                                     conclusion (and again, not find out
                                     what it actually shows), then you
                                     would do a narrative, not a
                                     systematic, review, and this is
                                     exactly what the authors have done.
                                     So what’s the big deal? In a
                                     systematic review, you have to
                                     predefine your methods, including
                                     searching and inclusion criteria. You
                                     should actually publish and register
                                     this before conducting the review.
                                     Doing this makes it way more
                                     difficult to exclude studies that do
                                     not support your desired outcome.
                                     The search and exclusions are carried
                                     out by multiple researchers and the
                                     way any disagreements will be handled
                                     is decided in advance. Using this
                                     method, you do not exclude studies
                                     based on, for example, validity of
                                     study design as they have. You
                                     include them and then you can account
                                     for methods that introduce bias in
                                     different ways, such as rating them
                                     using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool.
                                     The method that I am describing,
                                     called the Systematic Review, is
                                     universally accepted as a design that
                                     when executed well greatly reduces
                                     bias as compared to a narrative
                                     review. For example, the methods of
                                     their narrative review are
                                     inadequately described in order to
                                     ascertain how easily a study that was
                                     identified in the search could be
                                     tossed out do to “methodological
                                     problems.” The bottom line is, with a
                                     systematic review performed according
                                     to pre-published methods, if
                                     different researchers performed the
                                     review, the probability that they
                                     would come to the same conclusion is
                                     extremely high. With a narrative
                                     review, you can literally support any
                                     conclusion that you like.
                                     “I’m nevertheless confident that the
                                     vaccine schedule is safe because
                                     those people who are experts are
                                     essentially unanimous on the
                                     subject.” That’s fantastic, I’m sure
                                     you sleep very well at night. You
                                     seem to have an enviably naïve,
                                     albeit unrealistic, view about how
                                     often medical consensus changes.
                                     Prasad and colleagues (2011) found
                                     that 13% of published studies in NEJM
                                     in 2009 constituted reversals of
                                     current practice while Ioannidis’
                                     well-respected and highly-cited 2005
                                     paper “Why Most Published Research
                                     Findings Are False” lends more
                                     reasonable doubt into the solidity of
                                     medical consensus.
                                     This is not a criticism of
                                     conventional medicine – this is a
                                     well-acknowledged reality within the
                                     field. Dr David Sackett, frequently
                                     attributed as the father of
                                     evidence-based medicine, said to his
                                     students: “Half of what you’ll learn
                                     in medical school will be shown to be
                                     either dead wrong or out of date
                                     within five years of your graduation;
                                     the trouble is that nobody can tell
                                     you which half–so the most important
                                     thing to learn is how to learn on
                                     your own.”
                                     (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/arti
                                     cles/PMC300793/) The certainty that
                                     you place in the correctness of
                                     “medical consensus” is really not
                                     shared by people more familiar with
                                     the field than you.
                                     “In other words, I’m confident that
                                     vaccines are safe for the same reason
                                     I’m confident that antibiotics . . .
                                     are safe. I’m an expert in none of
                                     them, but the people who have studied
                                     them have concluded overwhelmingly
                                     that they’re safe, and I have no
                                     particular reason to believe those
                                     conclusions are the result of a giant
                                     shadowy conspiracy.”
                                     You don’t seem to appreciate, despite
                                     a large number of very impressive
                                     medical advances, how little we
                                     collectively as a species understand
                                     about how the human body works. Let’s
                                     put conspiracy (and the unfortunate
                                     reality that over half of medical
                                     research funding comes from the
                                     pharmaceutical industry which we’ve
                                     already seen significantly effects
                                     outcomes) aside. We are just
                                     scratching the surface of how our DNA
                                     interacts with its environment, how
                                     the brain works, how the immune
                                     system works, how inflammation
                                     affects the brain . . . and on and on
                                     and on. Our current conclusions are
                                     likely to be changed in the future,
                                     not because of conspiracy, but simply
                                     because we don’t know everything yet.
                                     Your example about the safety of
                                     antibiotics is extremely fitting and
                                     in some ways analogous to vaccines.
                                     Antibiotics are a class of drugs that
                                     since their inception in 1941 have
                                     saved millions of lives. In some
                                     people, they cause life-threating
                                     adverse reactions and even death. But
                                     these events are sufficiently rare
                                     that we generally consider them safe.
                                     However, two disturbing trends have
                                     begun to emerge. First, over-use of
                                     antibiotics (undoubtedly tied to
                                     their perception as being “safe” and
                                     “effective”) has led to the rise of
                                     antibiotic resistant bacteria (“one
                                     of our most serious health threats”,
                                     according to the CDC. The second, is
                                     a long-term effect of antibiotics
                                     that are just beginning to be
                                     explored, which is their short and
                                     long-term effects on the gut

                                     The role of the microbiome is a
                                     rapidly emerging area of research,
                                     but a new consensus is developing
                                     that indicates it’s central to our
                                     health and imbalance is connected
                                     with all of the most common chronic
                                     illnesses in our society (obesity,
                                     depression, CVD, etc). So is there a
                                     direct cause and effect relationship
                                     between antibiotic use and these
                                     illnesses? That’s very difficult to
                                     prove because we’re talking about
                                     complex systems with multiple
                                     interactions. But does antibiotic
                                     overuse play a significant role? The
                                     emerging evidence suggests that it’s
                                     likely to be a contributing factor.
                                     So are antibiotics safe? Well, 10 –
                                     20 years ago medical consensus would
                                     simply say “yes” (and perhaps people
                                     who asked the question “how do you
                                     know?” were considered to be very
                                     bad, dangerous, deluded people who
                                     were ignorers of “truth”). Now, the
                                     medical consensus is: if you’re not
                                     allergic to them, then taking them
                                     when you have a life-threatening
                                     bacterial infection or if you’re
                                     having surgery would be prudent. But
                                     the manner in which they are
                                     currently prescribed poses long-term
                                     health risks to society as a whole
                                     and contributes to our collectively
                                     worsening health.

                                     unvaccinated controls have not been
                                     done. You have not answered my
                                     question, which is how the current
                                     available research is able to answer
                                     the question about the relative
                                     safety of being vaccinated vs not
                                     being vaccinated. Do you see the
                                     difference? For a variety of
                                     practical reasons, there are no
                                     scientific studies on the long-term
                                     effects of the current vaccination
                                     schedule as compared to not being
                                     vaccinated (not even in the National
                                     Academies Report). You seem to be
                                     taking an “innocent until proven
                                     guilty” approach (quite similar to
                                     what was done in the case of the
                                     overuse of antibiotics). But in the
                                     US, we have a situation of worsening
                                     health outcomes, increasing chronic
                                     disease and health care costs,
                                     increasing childhood illness,
                                     increasing atopia and auotimmune
                                     illness, and there’s no data that
                                     will allow us to ascertain what role,
                                     if any, the increasing vaccine
                                     schedule is playing in that picture.
                                     And just humor me for a second. I’m
                                     not trying to introduce doubt for
                                     sadistic reasons. The incidence of
                                     autoimmune diseases, for example, is
                                     increasing rapidly. We know that
                                     these have a genetic component and an
                                     environmental component. Vaccines, by
                                     virtue of what they do, alter the
                                     immune system (create an imbalance
                                     between the T1 and T2 classes of
                                     antibodies, similar to what we see in
                                     autoimmune diseases). Autoimmune
                                     diseases are multi-factorial and
                                     often take years to develop, making
                                     simple cause and effect difficult, if
                                     not impossible to establish. Because
                                     we do not have data on unvaccinated
                                     controls, there’s no way to establish
                                     what role, if any, vaccines are
                                     playing in the rising incidence of
                                     these diseases. And yet, the
                                     biological plausibility of such an
                                     association is high.
                                     I am not a lawyer, so I don’t know
                                     what school of rhetoric I have just
                                     evoked by posing this question. But I
                                     still maintain that the situation is
                                     much more complicated than closed
                                     questions can adequately or
                                     reasonably answer. I do not think
                                     that vaccines are “guilty until
                                     proven innocent” but caution and
                                     humility seem appropriate.

                                     Did the incidence of autism in the
                                     USA rise sharply in the 1970s and
                                     1980 after the 1971 introduction of
                                     the MMR vaccine, and even more when
                                     it was the preferred vaccine for the
                                     1978 Measles Elimination Program?
                                     Since 2006 National Vaccine Injury
                                     Compensation Program has compensated
                                     1300 claims out of almost two billion
                                     vaccine doses. How does one
                                     compensated claim per 1.5 million
                                     vaccine doses where the level of
                                     evidence required is very small show
                                     that vaccines carry an unnecessary
                                     risk?
                                     If you are going to use the “Pharma
                                     paid studies bad” argument, then you
                                     need to explain how preventing
                                     diseases with vaccines is more costly
                                     than treating them. So how much would
                                     society benefit financially by not
                                     vaccinating any child over the next
                                     ten years? See the following papers

                                     The issue that I initially took with
                                     Dr Raff’s blog post is the way she
                                     used references to support her
                                     conclusions.
                                     You did so by illustrating what a
                                     real false dichotomy looks like. Dr.
                                     Raff didn’t purport to present all
                                     the research on vaccines; she
                                     presented information accurately
                                     representing the conclusions of that
                                     research. You presented misleading
                                     information in an attempt to make it
                                     appear, falsely, that there is an
                                     open question as to whether vaccines
                                     cause autism or chelation treats it.
                                     Once again, a reader of Dr. Raff’s
                                     piece would walk away with a true
                                     impression of the state of the
                                     research. A reader of your piece
                                     would walk away with a false
                                     impression of the state of the
                                     research. And not by accident—you
                                     went to great effort to create that
                                     false impression.
                                     Nor do I think that you can claw your
                                     way back to moral high ground by
                                     pretending you were only complaining
                                     about the references Dr. Raff used.
                                     This is a blog post, not a formal
                                     research article. She used sources
                                     that are accessible to most people
                                     and summarized the state of the
                                     research. Your specific complaints
                                     about those sources are ludicrous;
                                     you’re unhappy that she used a Forbes
                                     article, but she didn’t claim it was
                                     scientific research—she used it to
                                     illustrate the rhetoric being used by
                                     anti-vaxers such as yourself. The
                                     “weather.com” article is very
                                     well-referenced and sourced, but
                                     rather than addressing those
                                     references and sources you attacked
                                     the URL. And all of these complaints
                                     are just the preamble to your attempt
                                     to substitute, for the real
                                     information Dr. Raff presented, your
                                     terrible anti-vax articles. Your
                                     complaints are sophistry.
                                     I may be a lay person in the field of
                                     vaccine research (as is Dr Raff, to
                                     the best of knowledge) but I have
                                     post-graduate training in research
                                     methods and two research degrees.
                                     Your “about me” says you have a
                                     Masters in Acupuncture. Are you
                                     counting that as a “research degree?”
                                     Regardless, you don’t need even one
                                     “research degree” to understand that
                                     (a) a blog post needn’t cite only
                                     paywalled articles most readers can’t
                                     access; (b) discussing the state of
                                     the research overall can obviously
                                     involve news media sources; and (c)
                                     your own sources are the worst of the
                                     worst.
                                     You keep arguing that her use of
                                     references to support her statements
                                     was valid because you agree with her
                                     conclusions.
                                     No, I’m arguing that your rebuttal is
                                     a hit piece, an attempt to slyly
                                     insert debunked anti-vax “research”
                                     into the discussion. Her use of
                                     references is valid because those
                                     references are appropriate to the
                                     context and discussion, and are
                                     founded—unlike your sophistry—on the
                                     scientific consensus.
                                     All that having been said, now that I
                                     have read a bit more about it, I do
                                     have my concerns about the long-term
                                     adverse effects of the current
                                     vaccine schedule.
                                     I am shocked, shocked to find that
                                     gambling is going on in here! It was
                                     immediately obvious that a
                                     professional acupuncturist would be
                                     heavily incentivized to prefer woo
                                     over the scientific consensus, and
                                     that your article was thinly veiled
                                     anti-vax rhetoric. After all, you’ve
                                     invested a lot of time and money in
                                     unscientific medical woo, haven’t
                                     you? A master’s degree in acupuncture
                                     and a practice devoted to
                                     it—accepting that scientists know
                                     what they’re talking about implicitly
                                     devalues your sunk costs. You have
                                     tremendous incentives to reject the
                                     scientific consensus, but nothing
                                     compels you to do it by deceiving
                                     your readers.
                                     And who do you think funds and
                                     performs the overwhelming majority of
                                     pre-licensure vaccine trials?
                                     This isn’t a serious concern on your
                                     part; if you believed this was
                                     relevant, you wouldn’t have relied so
                                     heavily on anti-vax research funded
                                     by anti-vax advocacy groups. In any
                                     event, the detection of fraud is
                                     something with which I actually have
                                     a great deal of experience. Hundreds
                                     of trials don’t get distorted without
                                     evidence being created to demonstrate
                                     it—and despite the furious efforts of
                                     anti-vaxers like yourself to find
                                     fault with those studies, they still
                                     stand. Part of the reason for that is
                                     that even if 80% of studies were
                                     funded by vax manufacturers (I
                                     believe the number is much less than
                                     that, but don’t know for sure), and
                                     even if all of those studies were
                                     part of some shadowy pro-autism
                                     conspiracy, that would still leave a
                                     lot of independent trials to check
                                     their results.
                                     Once again, the proof is in the
                                     pudding. And when anti-vaxers try to
                                     prove their theories, or disprove the
                                     scientific consensus, they come up
                                     short. It’s not because of a global
                                     conspiracy—it’s because those
                                     theories are wrong.
                                     What do you think is more lucrative,
                                     chelation therapy or vaccines?
                                     For any individual practitioner,
                                     chelation therapy. No individual
                                     researcher gets rich doing vaccine
                                     safety trials, so they have small
                                     incentives to reach any predefined
                                     result. They have a very large
                                     incentive to reach the true result,
                                     since what makes a scientist
                                     respected and gives them status in
                                     their field is the quality of their
                                     work—which they know will be
                                     subjected to peer review and
                                     replication. Your article, on the
                                     other hand, was by someone who
                                     directly makes money off of
                                     chelation, and would have a hard time
                                     finding more patients if there wasn’t
                                     research out there he could point to
                                     purporting to show that lots of
                                     people without the usual signs of
                                     heavy metal poisoning need this
                                     expensive and dangerous therapy.
                                     Unlike vaccine safety researchers,
                                     this person had a direct, personal
                                     financial stake in the product. And
                                     unlike vaccine safety researchers,
                                     his results weren’t replicated by
                                     disinterested parties. Why is that?
                                     Another conspiracy to suppress
                                     chelation? Who’s in on this plot? And
                                     why?
                                     I’ve taken a skim through this and
                                     here are some initial concerns.
                                     Looking at the chapter on Allergy and
                                     Asthma, a couple of things jump out.
                                     First, the authors write in the
                                     intro: “it is necessary to have a
                                     detailed understanding of the
                                     relationship between allergic disease
                                     and vaccination, because the
                                     effectiveness of the immunization
                                     program may be adversely impacted by
                                     a perception that vaccination is
                                     harmful.” So the authors have stated
                                     that the purpose of reviewing the
                                     literature is to disprove any
                                     relationship between vaccines and
                                     asthma, and not as one could only
                                     hope, to find out if any relationship
                                     exists.
                                     The more you defend your sophistry
                                     the deeper you dig your hole. This
                                     statement is absurd. The authors
                                     didn’t state “that the purpose of
                                     reviewing the literature is to
                                     disprove any relationship between
                                     vaccines and asthma.” They wrote that
                                     “it is necessary to have a detailed
                                     understanding of the relationship
                                     between allergic disease and
                                     vaccination.” They are concerned
                                     about the impact on vaccinations,
                                     which they should be given how
                                     bloggers like yourself distort and
                                     deceive people to scare them about
                                     vaccines. But nothing in that
                                     statement says that they want to do
                                     anything other than “have a detailed
                                     understanding of the relationship
                                     between allergic disease and
                                     vaccination.” Your clumsy
                                     substitution, in an attempt to
                                     ascribe evil motives to the
                                     researchers, is plainly dishonest.
                                     Then, the authors write: “Though the
                                     committee did not undertake a formal
                                     systematic review, the quality of
                                     individual articles was judged by the
                                     validity of the study design, the
                                     method by which the research was
                                     conducted, and the transparency of
                                     methods.” And this makes sense; if
                                     you want to summarise the literature
                                     in a way to support a given
                                     conclusion (and again, not find out
                                     what it actually shows), then you
                                     would do a narrative, not a
                                     systematic, review, and this is
                                     exactly what the authors have done.
                                     The quality of the articles was
                                     judged by (a) the validity of the
                                     study design, (b) the research
                                     methodology, and (c) the transparency
                                     of those methods. I don’t see a (d)
                                     in there, but you’re claiming this
                                     they’re filtering for study results
                                     as well. It’s easy to say that, but
                                     hard to explain why it might be true
                                     or how this report supports that
                                     conclusion. So you don’t try, you
                                     just announce it—more sophistry.
                                     You go on a bit about the committee’s
                                     “searching and inclusion criteria,”
                                     but the points you specified above
                                     are neither. They’re the criteria by
                                     which they evaluated “the quality of
                                     individual articles.” The search
                                     criteria are defined elsewhere; it
                                     looks like an extremely broad
                                     literature search. Did they unfairly
                                     exclude or malign high-quality
                                     anti-vax research? I don’t think so.
                                     You could possibly persuade me by
                                     locating such research—I don’t think
                                     it’s out there.
                                     “I’m nevertheless confident that the
                                     vaccine schedule is safe because
                                     those people who are experts are
                                     essentially unanimous on the
                                     subject.” That’s fantastic, I’m sure
                                     you sleep very well at night.
                                     I do, thank you! One reason is that
                                     vaccination rates, despite the best
                                     efforts of snake oil salesmen,
                                     quacks, and shady bloggers, remain
                                     quite high in the United States—over
                                     90%. And the consistent failure of
                                     said salesmen, quacks, and bloggers
                                     to support their scaremongering with
                                     anything but angry rhetoric reassures
                                     me that this isn’t likely to change
                                     in the foreseeable future. We’re
                                     arguing over the last mile, the most
                                     intransigent advocates of
                                     make-believe medicine.
                                     You seem to have an enviably naïve,
                                     albeit unrealistic, view about how
                                     often medical consensus changes.
                                     “Albeit” doesn’t mean what you think
                                     it means. I expect the medical
                                     consensus changes quite often! It was
                                     (barely) within living memory that
                                     doctors helped advertise cigarettes
                                     as good for the lungs. Do you know
                                     what changed that consensus? Data. Do
                                     you know what anti-vaxers have tried
                                     and failed to find to support their
                                     ideology? Data.
                                     It’s called the Galileo fallacy: they
                                     laughed at Galileo, but he was right.
                                     That doesn’t mean that being laughed
                                     at makes you right—you still have to
                                     be right. The anti-vax community has
                                     labored in vain for many years
                                     precisely because their beliefs
                                     aren’t correct. Consequently
                                     anti-vaxers like yourself fall back
                                     on rhetoric and scaremongering; you
                                     can’t point to serious research
                                     supporting your conclusions, so you
                                     slyly imply that the terrible
                                     research is just as good as the
                                     scientific consensus.
                                     You don’t seem to appreciate, despite
                                     a large number of very impressive
                                     medical advances, how little we
                                     collectively as a species understand
                                     about how the human body works.
                                     Is it Qi? That’s a big idea in
                                     acupuncture, right? Please enlighten
                                     us. What knowledge “about how the
                                     human body works” guides you in
                                     needle placement? Energy meridians?
                                     Psychic forces?
                                     Yes, “we collectively as a species
                                     understand” fairly little about how
                                     the human body works. But some
                                     members of our species—like the
                                     M.D./Ph.D.s who study the immune
                                     system—understand it much better than
                                     others—like acupuncturists.
                                     Your example about the safety of
                                     antibiotics is extremely fitting and
                                     in some ways analogous to vaccines.
                                     Yes. Both are well-studied and quite
                                     safe. What issues there are with
                                     these medicines are studied by
                                     doctors and scientists; the
                                     unscientific detractors such as
                                     anti-vaxers and deniers of the germ
                                     theory of disease are hooting and
                                     hollering from the sidelines, but the
                                     real work is being done by qualified
                                     professionals.
                                     You have not answered my question,
                                     which is how the current available
                                     research is able to answer the
                                     question about the relative safety of
                                     being vaccinated vs not being
                                     vaccinated.
                                     Through the use of neutral placebos
                                     where possible and population studies
                                     where not. My answer may be
                                     incomplete; neither of us is an
                                     expert in these studies, immunology,
                                     or epidemiology. Of course, the
                                     people who are experts in those
                                     fields overwhelmingly conclude that
                                     the data refute your scaremongering.
                                     Even Dr. Sears, who has tremendous
                                     incentives to attack the safety of
                                     the schedule and the deep pockets to
                                     do the research, had to admit he had
                                     no evidence-based basis for
                                     challenging that consensus.
                                     Consequently you had to dive deep
                                     into very poor research to find
                                     anything to support your position.
                                     You’ve stopped trying to defend those
                                     articles; why is that?
                                     And just humor me for a second. I’m
                                     not trying to introduce doubt for
                                     sadistic reasons.
                                     I agree. I think you are trying to
                                     introduce doubt to generate pagehits,
                                     and because you have tremendous
                                     personal incentives to believe that
                                     the scientific consensus (which
                                     doubts the efficacy of acupuncture)
                                     is inferior to magical medicine (in
                                     which you have a graduate degree). I
                                     don’t think for a second that you
                                     want to hurt people, or believe that
                                     your scaremongering is doing so. But
                                     I think that’s because you are
                                     disinterested in seriously analyzing
                                     the evidence, especially where doing
                                     so would implicitly devalue the time
                                     and effort you’ve sunk into
                                     unscientific “medicine.”
                                     I am not a lawyer, so I don’t know
                                     what school of rhetoric I have just
                                     evoked by posing this question.
                                     I’m no logician, but I’d call it an
                                     association fallacy. “Vaccines affect
                                     the immune system” does not logically
                                     support the conclusion that it’s
                                     biologically plausible that vaccines
                                     are to blame for an increase in
                                     autoimmune disorders. Nor is that a
                                     well-evidenced argument; it’s been
                                     analyzed and rejected on the merits.
                                     But I still maintain that the
                                     situation is much more complicated
                                     than closed questions can adequately
                                     or reasonably answer. I do not think
                                     that vaccines are “guilty until
                                     proven innocent” but caution and
                                     humility seem appropriate.
                                     Yes, you’re “just asking questions.”
                                     But they aren’t serious questions
                                     about whether vaccines are safe;
                                     they’re closed, misleading questions
                                     that are intended to create the false
                                     impression that your terrible vaccine
                                     research—so bad that you’ve stopped
                                     even trying to defend it—is somehow
                                     as meaningful as the vast body of
                                     scientific research concluding that
                                     vaccines are safe and effective. Let
                                     me return to the ultimate conclusion
                                     here: a reader of Dr. Raff’s piece
                                     would walk away with a true
                                     impression of the state of the
                                     research. A reader of your piece
                                     would walk away with a false
                                     impression of the state of the
                                     research. And not by accident—you
                                     went to great effort to create that
                                     false impression.

                                     Whoops, misread your comment–“albeit”
                                     does indeed mean what you think it
                                     does.

                                     As to my question on the issue you
                                     and others have giving money to
                                     pharmaceutical companies to prevent
                                     diseases, on how much would we save
                                     by not vaccinating children for the
                                     next ten years, which with four
                                     million births each year in the USA
                                     that would have lots of vulnerable
                                     kids. There has already been natural
                                     experiments of that happening
                                     elsewhere:
                                     Diphtheria in the former Soviet
                                     Union: reemergence of a pandemic
                                     disease.
                                     The result being:

     Although all of the Newly Independent States were affected, three
     quarters of the more than 140,000 cases (Table 1) and two thirds of
     the more than 4,000 deaths reported since 1990 (1-3) were reported
     by the Russian Federation.
                                     Measles vaccine coverage and factors
                                     related to uncompleted vaccination
                                     among 18-month-old and 36-month-old
                                     children in Kyoto, Japan
                                     The result was:

     In Japan, measles vaccine coverage has remained low, and either
     small or moderate outbreaks have occurred repeatedly in communities.
     According to an infectious disease surveillance (2000), total
     measles cases were estimated to be from 180,000 to 210,000, and
     total deaths were estimated to be 88 [11,12]. Measles cases are most
     frequently observed among non-immunized children, particularly
     between 12 to 24 months.
                                     So again, the question is about
                                     relative risks and real costs. So
                                     instead of “just asking questions”
                                     answer mine about the actual risks
                                     and costs. Because as a parent who
                                     had had a child get hospital care for
                                     a now vaccine preventable disease, I
                                     really want to know why it would be
                                     so cost effective to just treat
                                     measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria,
                                     pertussis, HIb, rotavirus, influenza,
                                     cervical cancer, liver cancer,
                                     pneumonia, etc instead of preventing
                                     them.

                                     “Take safety – people are asking are
                                     vaccines safe? (And Dr Raff answers
                                     this with a simple “yes, they are,
                                     look at this single study”).
                                     Answering this type of closed
                                     question with a simple ‘yes’ or ‘no’
                                     is simply not supported anywhere in
                                     the research literature or in
                                     reality. Vaccines can and do cause
                                     serious adverse events. So does
                                     infection by vaccine-preventable
                                     illness.”
                                     No, the question is the relative
                                     risk. Which is why I asked you to
                                     provide the scientific documentation
                                     about the MMR versus measles, and
                                     about its affect on autism rates in
                                     the USA during the 1970s and 1980s.
                                     “There are many ways to measure
                                     safety and there are enough
                                     reasonable concerns that have been
                                     raised – according to the Department
                                     of Health, the Vaccine Injury
                                     Compensation Program has paid out
                                     $2.7 billion in compensation for
                                     vaccine injuries …(mistyped link
                                     removed).. and the National Academies
                                     report raises reasonable concerns”
                                     Really? Have you looked at those
                                     numbers, especially the table on that
                                     page under the title Filed Calendar
                                     Year 2006 to Present? If you go to
                                     the bottom of the page you find that
                                     total number of vaccine doses given
                                     since 2006 is 1,968,399,297, and the
                                     number of compensated claims is a
                                     mere 1300. That is a ratio of over
                                     1,500,000 to one. That is 1.5 million
                                     to one. How does that raise a
                                     reasonable concern? Sure you can
                                     claim big numbers, but you have to
                                     read them in context.
                                     (By the way, the National Academy
                                     report on immunization is now ten
                                     years old. The studies that they
                                     recommended have been done. See link
                                     I included in the penultimate
                                     paragraph, it has much of the studies
                                     done since then)
                                     “As such, asking questions that
                                     acknowledge the complexity of the
                                     issues around vaccines is a
                                     reasonable thing to do. Claiming that
                                     the scientific literature supports a
                                     simple “yes” or “no” answer to the
                                     question “Are vaccines safe?” is
                                     completely irresponsible.”
                                     The questions have been asked, and
                                     answered. Multiple times. And the
                                     relative risk of getting vaccine is
                                     much much lower (over a million times
                                     lower) than getting the actual
                                     disease. Many of those answers are in
                                     this list: Vaccine Safety: Examine
                                     the Evidence.
                                     Go through that list, and see what
                                     they conclude. If you disagree with
                                     any of those papers then bring up
                                     those concerns and discuss them. Do
                                     not continue on this “just asking
                                     questions” crusade. If you have
                                     evidence that any vaccine on the
                                     American pediatric schedule causes
                                     more harm than the disease then just
                                     post the PubMed indexed studies by
                                     reputable qualified researchers to

                                     I think I’ve been transparent since I
                                     published my post that I was not
                                     familiar with the vaccination
                                     literature before I wrote it. To my
                                     credit, I still haven not visited any
                                     “anti-vax” websites, where I’m sure I
                                     could find arguments that others have
                                     made and repeat those. Everything I
                                     have written or cited is based on my
                                     own research, such as it is.
                                     I was unaware that the papers that I
                                     had referenced were considered to be
                                     low quality. You keep saying that
                                     referring to them is the same thing
                                     as claiming they are of high quality.
                                     I disagree, but you’re the lawyer. I
                                     still have not had time to thoroughly
                                     critically review them or look at
                                     others’ criticism of them, which is
                                     why I have stopped mentioning them.
                                     I chose to write the article because
                                     Dr Raff’s post had been brought to my
                                     attention as a good way to educate
                                     myself on the research evidence
                                     around vaccines (perhaps it’s not her
                                     fault that it was misrepresented this
                                     way). I was aware of a controversy,
                                     but did not have familiarity with the
                                     published literature.
                                     As previously stated, when I first
                                     read the post, I did not click the
                                     links (I was looking on my phone) but
                                     it appeared to be well-researched and
                                     well referenced and seemed to address
                                     all of the issues. When I did have an
                                     opportunity to sit down and follow
                                     the links, I identified that most did
                                     not point to scientific evidence at
                                     all. You correctly point out that it
                                     is indeed a blog post, not an article
                                     published in a journal. But I still
                                     maintain that it was sloppy and
                                     misleading. If the evidence is so
                                     one-sided and clear cut and you’re
                                     making a case as to what the research
                                     shows as a researcher, not as a
                                     layperson, there really isn’t any
                                     need to point mostly to secondary
                                     sources (there is a vast array of
                                     literature accessible for free) –
                                     unless your article is about what the
                                     media says or “experts” say about
                                     vaccines, not the scientific
                                     evidence.

                                     Chris, your request that I stop
                                     asking questions about health issues
                                     and research (asking questions about
                                     study design as a tired ‘manoeuvre’?)
                                     is simply so bizarre I really don’t
                                     know how to respond. You are turning
                                     scientific research and consensus
                                     into dogma and evangelism, which is
                                     scary and very unscientific. It also
                                     reveals your lack of understanding of
                                     science in general, which tests
                                     hypothesis and always has strengths
                                     and weaknesses. If you demonstrated
                                     any ability to critically examine the
                                     evidence that you use in support of
                                     your argument, fairly identifying the
                                     strengths and weaknesses that by
                                     definition exist, it would be so much
                                     easier to believe that you actually
                                     know what you’re talking about and
                                     actually understand the body of
                                     literature that you’re referencing.
                                     Using Colin’s previous example, I
                                     accept that seat belts are safe even
                                     though they occasionally cause
                                     injury, but I can’t imagine a
                                     remotely similar level of anger and
                                     disrespect being attracted by someone
                                     who desires to critically review the
                                     evidence and ask questions about how
                                     “experts” came to that opinion. That
                                     I ask questions about study design
                                     and point out the research that has
                                     not been done (yep, still asking
                                     questions), really should not be
                                     threatening or anger provoking for
                                     rational people interested in the
                                     evidence base. I am new to this
                                     research, which you say is very
                                     compelling and completely one-sided.
                                     Rather than ridicule me and call me
                                     names for asking questions, educate
                                     me. And if you could be a tad more
                                     realistic and balanced in your
                                     approach to the issue (your
                                     overconfidence in what research can
                                     and cannot show sets off lots of
                                     alarms as to your understanding of
                                     scientific methods in general), then
                                     I would be able to have more trust
                                     that you had actually approached the
                                     issue critically, rather than with
                                     foregone conclusions due to
                                     unfortunate personal circumstances.
                                     ““What do the people with the
                                     greatest access to and understanding

                                     been asked by government agencies
                                     like the WHO and CDC.”
                                     “I am shocked, shocked to find that
                                     gambling is going on in here! It was
                                     immediately obvious that a
                                     professional acupuncturist would be
                                     heavily incentivized to prefer woo
                                     over the scientific consensus, and
                                     that your article was thinly veiled
                                     anti-vax rhetoric.”
                                     First, I appreciated your use of the
                                     Casablanca quote, very good. =)
                                     But second, highlighting that I’m an
                                     acupuncturist as a way of undermining
                                     what I’m saying is ad hominem and
                                     doesn’t add anything to the
                                     discussion. You have previously
                                     identified the WHO as an example of
                                     scientific medical authority, and
                                     both that institution and the NIH
                                     promote acupuncture as a
                                     scientifically evidence-based medical
                                     intervention. So please spare me the
                                     “unscientific medical woo” rubbish.
                                     It has nothing to do with vaccine
                                     research and makes you seem
                                     desperate.
                                     “In any event, the detection of fraud
                                     is something with which I actually
                                     have a great deal of experience.
                                     Hundreds of trials don’t get
                                     distorted without evidence being
                                     created to demonstrate it—and despite
                                     the furious efforts of anti-vaxers
                                     like yourself to find fault with
                                     those studies, they still stand. Part
                                     of the reason for that is that even
                                     if 80% of studies were funded by vax
                                     manufacturers (I believe the number
                                     is much less than that, but don’t
                                     know for sure), and even if all of
                                     those studies were part of some
                                     shadowy pro-autism conspiracy, that
                                     would still leave a lot of
                                     independent trials to check their
                                     results.”
                                     Sorry, do you really not understand
                                     how a body of research around a
                                     medical question or hypothesis is
                                     generated? By forcing me to point out
                                     the obvious, you’re making me come
                                     off as way more anti-research than I
                                     actually am. That is to say, by not
                                     acknowledging the well-known and
                                     widely accepted weaknesses inherent
                                     in medical research and how it gets
                                     skewed, it’s left to me to keep
                                     pointing it out. I really do have
                                     great respect for scientific research
                                     when applied appropriately.
                                     Besides the added bias that comes
                                     with pharmaceutical companies
                                     achieving outcomes that are more
                                     positive than when other people test
                                     the same thing, publication bias is a
                                     pretty effective way of skewing the
                                     results of the literature as a whole
                                     away from what is actually happening.
                                     So you’re right, there is evidence
                                     that demonstrates that hundreds of
                                     trials are distorted, the only
                                     question is how distorted.

                                     Take a look at this 13.5 minute video
                                     – If you don’t know him already,
                                     you’d like Ben Goldacre. He’s a
                                     self-described “debunker” like
                                     yourself, out to save the world from
                                     “quacks” like me, amongst other
                                     things.
                                     So, the estimate that I have read is
                                     that about 55-60% of medical research
                                     in general is funded by industry, i
                                     don’t know the proportion for
                                     vaccines in particular. And we know
                                     that those results are more likely to
                                     be positive when compared to studies
                                     not conducted by industry to an
                                     extent greater than “normal” bias
                                     would support. This can be due to a
                                     number of factors independent of
                                     publication bias, such as designing
                                     the study in a way to achieve a
                                     favourable outcome (in the choice of
                                     outcomes measures, for example). But
                                     over and above this, it is ubiquitous
                                     for drug companies to not publish or
                                     withhold the results of negative
                                     trials. So we are simply not getting
                                     the full picture. And when we
                                     summarise the available evidence, the
                                     conclusions that we come to are
                                     different than what the research
                                     actually found.
                                     “Yes. Both are well-studied and quite
                                     safe. What issues there are with
                                     these medicines are studied by
                                     doctors and scientists; the
                                     unscientific detractors such as
                                     anti-vaxers and deniers of the germ
                                     theory of disease are hooting and
                                     hollering from the sidelines, but the
                                     real work is being done by qualified
                                     professionals.”
                                     Huh? The doctors and scientists
                                     originally touted antibiotics for the
                                     wonderful achievement that they are
                                     and identified them as “safe”
                                     (however it was defined) based on
                                     short-term outcomes and an incomplete
                                     view of human physiology. Now doctors
                                     and scientists, with the benefit of
                                     more data, better technology and a
                                     bit of hindsight, see that the way in
                                     which antibiotics have been used and
                                     are currently being used, while
                                     having saved many lives, have also
                                     endangered many other lives. Denial
                                     of germ theory doesn’t enter this
                                     picture at all. I’m sorry you seem to
                                     find it difficult when people point
                                     out nuance in areas that you
                                     erroneously view as black and white.
                                     Your response to the change in
                                     consensus around the safety of
                                     antibiotics sounds delusional, it has
                                     nothing to do with anyone “hollering
                                     from the sidelines.”

                                     Hold on, back up. Through out your
                                     discourse, you repeatedly differ
                                     actual analysis of “the evidence” to
                                     the “experts”, citing your lack of

                                     and research. I, on the other hand,

                                     have completed university-level
                                     course work in biochemistry (separate
                                     from my degree in acupuncture, which
                                     included courses in anatomy &

                                     analyse the assumptions that have
                                     generated those conclusions, which is
                                     standard research practice, you say
                                     that I’m scaremongering.
                                     ““Vaccines affect the immune system”
                                     does not logically support the
                                     conclusion that it’s biologically
                                     plausible that vaccines are to blame
                                     for an increase in autoimmune
                                     disorders.”
                                     What I actually said (actually, I
                                     typed it, so I’m not sure why you’re
                                     confused about what was communicated)
                                     was that vaccines “alter the immune
                                     system (create an imbalance between
                                     the T1 and T2 classes of antibodies,
                                     similar to what we see in autoimmune
                                     diseases).” (although, I ‘misspoke’,
                                     technically only T2 cells generate
                                     antibodies). It can also create an
                                     overstimulation of the immune system
                                     (too good at what it does),
                                     biologically consistent with
                                     autoimmune aetiology. But I also said
                                     that autoimmune illness is
                                     multifactorial, so I am not looking
                                     for any single thing “to blame” (so
                                     litigious!) I am interested in
                                     evaluating potential contributing
                                     factors.
                                     “The quality of the articles was
                                     judged by (a) the validity of the
                                     study design, (b) the research
                                     methodology, and (c) the transparency
                                     of those methods. I don’t see a (d)
                                     in there, but you’re claiming this
                                     they’re filtering for study results
                                     as well. It’s easy to say that, but
                                     hard to explain why it might be true
                                     or how this report supports that
                                     conclusion.”
                                     The report states that a systematic
                                     review was not performed and does not
                                     say why, even though this would be
                                     the only appropriate study design to
                                     answer the committee’s question
                                     (meta-analysis would probably not be
                                     possible but systematic review would
                                     be). Can you offer me a reasonable
                                     explanation for why a narrative
                                     review, which is a far more bias-pone
                                     prone method, was conducted rather
                                     than a systematic review? Your
                                     defence of their methods (“I don’t
                                     see a (d)) really belies your lack of
                                     familiarity with the research
                                     methods. The (d), which is bias
                                     introduced by the inferior study
                                     design, occurs because their methods
                                     are not reproducible, too much is
                                     left to the individual researcher’s
                                     judgment. If you take their
                                     admittedly wide initial search and
                                     you hand the results to 10 different
                                     groups of researchers, at the end
                                     your likely to end up with 10 wildly
                                     different groups of studies included
                                     for analysis. This can and does
                                     happen unintentionally because too
                                     much of the choice is left up to
                                     individual judgment. This design is
                                     inherently subjective.
                                     With a systematic review, after
                                     performing the same initial search,
                                     if you handed these initial results
                                     to 10 different groups of researchers
                                     with the pre-published protocol, the
                                     10 results would be highly
                                     concordant.
                                     It doesn’t matter if they chose a
                                     narrative review for innocent
                                     reasons, or otherwise. It is not the
                                     appropriate design to answer their
                                     stated research question, period. So
                                     it’s either due to ulterior motives
                                     or incompetence. That you are arguing
                                     that their methods were appropriate
                                     shows a lack of understanding of
                                     their study design, which is fine.
                                     But it’s coming off more as a
                                     stubborn and uniformed obstinance
                                     that does not offer confidence in
                                     your ability to assess research
                                     literature in any meaningful way,
                                     you’re only interested in proving
                                     your point, even if you need to
                                     pretend certain things are other than
                                     they are. You’re position would be
                                     much stronger if you acknowledged the
                                     weaknesses, and then said you held
                                     your belief in spite of those
                                     weaknesses, instead of pretending
                                     that they don’t exist.

                                     It is abundantly clear that your
                                     views about what the vaccine
                                     literature does and does not show are
                                     based on tragic personal experience
                                     and a need for things to be black and
                                     white – not based on how scientific
                                     research actually works. Through out
                                     this conversation, you are
                                     consistently demonstrating that you
                                     always begin with your conclusion,
                                     and then back track to find support
                                     for it. If that were not the case,
                                     you would not find someone pointing
                                     out the inherent weaknesses in the
                                     evidence on which your conclusions
                                     are based so threatening. The
                                     weaknesses in the evidence don’t mean
                                     that the conclusions are wrong. But
                                     saying that the weaknesses are not
                                     there because you’re firm in your
                                     conclusions is delusional.
                                     I find it perfectly plausible that in
                                     spite of all of the valid points that
                                     I and many other researchers have
                                     made about the inherent weaknesses
                                     and shortcomings of scientific
                                     research in general and the vaccine
                                     research in particular (and despite
                                     your refusal to admit that they exist
                                     even though they are widely
                                     acknowledged within the medical
                                     research community), that vaccines
                                     are, on the whole, more safe and
                                     effective than not vaccinating for
                                     certain populations.
                                     But by labelling any accurate
                                     identification of weaknesses, holes
                                     and uncertainties inherent in the
                                     scientific literature as
                                     “scaremongering”, you unnecessarily
                                     dumb down the whole conversation in a
                                     way that really detracts from your
                                     arguments, and gives easy ammunition
                                     to “anti-vaxers.” You seem to be a
                                     man who requires certainty. If that
                                     is the case, then just take the word
                                     of the “experts” and stay out of the
                                     scientific debate – the literature
                                     could never support the certainty
                                     that you seem to require and are
                                     convinced exists. If you want to
                                     actually understand what the research
                                     does and does not show, you really
                                     need to get comfortable with
                                     uncertainty and the presence of bias
                                     and stop getting angry at anyone who
                                     accurately points them out.

                                     referring to them is the same thing
                                     as claiming they are of high
                                     quality.”

                                     and research (asking questions about
                                     study design as a tired ‘manoeuvre’?)
                                     is simply so bizarre I really don’t

                                     scary and very unscientific”
                                     No I am not. You are the only one
                                     bringing in the dogma, and when I
                                     look at what I wrote just above I am
                                     the one that actually brought up some
                                     actual relevant links. What kind of
                                     “dogma” is it that takes a number of
                                     compensated claims and finds the
                                     actual ratio. If you want to call
                                     simple arithmetic dogma, then you’ll
                                     excuse me if I don’t agree.

                                     strengths and weaknesses.”
                                     That is rich coming from someone who
                                     cannot tell biased research for real
                                     research, and cannot even divide
                                     “number of compensated claims” by
                                     “total of vaccine doses given.” I’d
                                     wager a bet that I had more science
                                     and labs for my engineering
                                     undergraduate degree than anything

                                     actually answer some, here is a
                                     repeat of the financial costs of not
                                     vaccinating:
                                     As to my question on the issue you
                                     and others have giving money to
                                     pharmaceutical companies to prevent
                                     diseases, on how much would we save
                                     by not vaccinating children for the
                                     next ten years, which with four
                                     million births each year in the USA
                                     that would have lots of vulnerable
                                     kids. There has already been natural
                                     experiments of that happening
                                     elsewhere:
                                     Diphtheria in the former Soviet

                                     disease.
                                     The result being:

     Although all of the Newly Independent States were affected, three
     quarters of the more than 140,000 cases (Table 1) and two thirds of
     the more than 4,000 deaths reported since 1990 (1-3) were reported
     by the Russian Federation.
                                     Measles vaccine coverage and factors
                                     related to uncompleted vaccination
                                     among 18-month-old and 36-month-old
                                     children in Kyoto, Japan
                                     The result was:

     In Japan, measles vaccine coverage has remained low, and either
     small or moderate outbreaks have occurred repeatedly in communities.
     According to an infectious disease surveillance (2000), total
     measles cases were estimated to be from 180,000 to 210,000, and
     total deaths were estimated to be 88 [11,12]. Measles cases are most
     frequently observed among non-immunized children, particularly
     between 12 to 24 months.
                                     So again, the question is about
                                     relative risks and real costs. So
                                     instead of “just asking questions”
                                     answer mine about the actual risks
                                     and costs. Because as a parent who
                                     had had a child get hospital care for
                                     a now vaccine preventable disease, I
                                     really want to know why it would be
                                     so cost effective to just treat
                                     measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria,
                                     pertussis, HIb, rotavirus, influenza,
                                     cervical cancer, liver cancer,
                                     pneumonia, etc instead of preventing
                                     them.
                                     Now answer that question!

                                     I was unaware that the papers that I
                                     had referenced were considered to be
                                     low quality. You keep saying that
                                     referring to them is the same thing
                                     as claiming they are of high quality.
                                     I disagree, but you’re the lawyer. I
                                     still have not had time to thoroughly
                                     critically review them or look at
                                     others’ criticism of them, which is
                                     why I have stopped mentioning them.
                                     This is that false dichotomy. You
                                     complained that Dr. Raff
                                     misrepresents the science, but your
                                     arguments are deeply misleading. For
                                     example, you are upset that she said
                                     that there is “no evidence that
                                     supports chelation as a safe
                                     treatment alternative because autism
                                     is not caused by metal poisoning.”
                                     You interpreted that statement
                                     hyper-literally, and held up as a
                                     counter example a “systematic review
                                     (the pinacle of the evidence
                                     hierarchy)” that supports chelation.
                                     But it’s of such poor quality that
                                     you’ve given up even attempting to
                                     support its conclusions. Dr. Raff is
                                     correct—that paper is not good
                                     evidence that chelation is a safe
                                     treatment alternative. (The lawsuit
                                     against that paper’s author has a lot
                                     to say about the safety of
                                     chelation!) Once again, a reader of
                                     her piece would walk away with an
                                     accurate impression of the science. A
                                     reader of yours would be misled. If
                                     that deception was simply the result
                                     of your failure to think critically
                                     about the research you were citing,
                                     then maybe you should start doing so.
                                     It’s never too late.
                                     I chose to write the article because
                                     Dr Raff’s post had been brought to my
                                     attention as a good way to educate
                                     myself on the research evidence
                                     around vaccines (perhaps it’s not her
                                     fault that it was misrepresented this
                                     way). I was aware of a controversy,
                                     but did not have familiarity with the
                                     published literature.
                                     Shrieking “LIAR!” at her was probably
                                     an inefficient way of educating
                                     yourself. It would have been much
                                     more productive to study the evidence
                                     first, and attack second, if at all.
                                     You correctly point out that it is
                                     indeed a blog post, not an article
                                     published in a journal. But I still
                                     maintain that it was sloppy and
                                     misleading.
                                     But you haven’t identified anything
                                     that was actually misleading. When
                                     you tried, for example by telling
                                     your readers that chelation is safe
                                     and effective, you failed
                                     miserably—and you’re telling us now
                                     it’s because you actually had no idea
                                     whether the research you cited was
                                     reliable or not. So what, exactly,
                                     was misleading?
                                     If the evidence is so one-sided and
                                     clear cut and you’re making a case as
                                     to what the research shows as a
                                     researcher, not as a layperson, there
                                     really isn’t any need to point mostly
                                     to secondary sources (there is a vast
                                     array of literature accessible for
                                     free) – unless your article is about
                                     what the media says or “experts” say
                                     about vaccines, not the scientific
                                     evidence.

                                     poor basis for calling Dr. Raff a
                                     liar. Consider the context of this
                                     post. The author is a scientist, but
                                     most of her readers are not
                                     (including you and I). Citing solely
                                     to news sources would imply a lack of
                                     scientific support, but citing solely
                                     to research articles renders the
                                     background material opaque to those
                                     who lack the resources, time, or
                                     training to read such material. Using
                                     a blend of both types of sources is
                                     not only eminently reasonable, it’s
                                     actually quite common. It would be
                                     inappropriate if there were anything
                                     actually wrong with the points she
                                     made, but that’s what you failed to
                                     show—and what you’re now telling us
                                     you lack the information to even
                                     allege.
                                     Chris . . . . . If you demonstrated
                                     any ability to critically examine the
                                     evidence that you use in support of
                                     your argument, fairly identifying the
                                     strengths and weaknesses that by
                                     definition exist, it would be so much
                                     easier to believe that you actually
                                     know what you’re talking about and
                                     actually understand the body of
                                     literature that you’re referencing.
                                     Please step back a moment and look at
                                     it from the context of those of us
                                     reading your piece, in which you
                                     attacked Dr. Raff as a liar and used,
                                     in support of your mud-slinging,
                                     research you now say you didn’t
                                     understand and hadn’t thought much
                                     about. Were you critically examining
                                     the evidence? Do you know what you’re
                                     talking about? Do you understand the
                                     body of literature that you’re
                                     referencing? Your comment is
                                     egregiously hypocritical, even by
                                     internet standards.
                                     Using Colin’s previous example, I
                                     accept that seat belts are safe even
                                     though they occasionally cause
                                     injury, but I can’t imagine a
                                     remotely similar level of anger and
                                     disrespect being attracted by someone
                                     who desires to critically review the
                                     evidence and ask questions about how
                                     “experts” came to that opinion.
                                     You’re seeing passion and
                                     interpreting it as anger. I am not,
                                     and I suspect Chris is not, angry,
                                     and have not been at any point in
                                     this conversation. Are you
                                     projecting?
                                     If there were a movement dedicated to
                                     persuading parents not to use
                                     seatbelts for ideological reasons—say
                                     by asking sly, leading questions
                                     about how those Ford-funded research
                                     scientists designed the so-called
                                     seatbelt safety studies, and by the
                                     way have never actually studied
                                     whether seatbelts cause autism! —then
                                     you would absolutely see the rest of
                                     us respond energetically to that
                                     irresponsible advocacy.
                                     But second, highlighting that I’m an
                                     acupuncturist as a way of undermining
                                     what I’m saying is ad hominem and
                                     doesn’t add anything to the
                                     discussion.
                                     This is a common mistake, and an easy
                                     one to make. Ad hominem, as a logical
                                     fallacy, is when someone says
                                     something like, “That argument is
                                     wrong because the person making it is
                                     a jerk.” That’s not my point. My
                                     point is that you have heavy personal
                                     incentives to disregard scientific
                                     consensus, which holds not only that
                                     vaccines are safe and effective but
                                     also that your chosen education and
                                     profession are quackery.
                                     Consequently, I suspect your thought
                                     process is not an attempt to find out
                                     whether vaccines are safe, but an
                                     attempt to find a basis for believing
                                     that they aren’t safe. There is a
                                     direct logical connection between
                                     whether your analysis is serious and
                                     whether you have misaligned
                                     incentives.
                                     In other words, I’m not saying that
                                     your argument is wrong because you’re
                                     an acupuncturist—I’m saying that your
                                     argument is wrong because it fails to
                                     take into account the totality of the
                                     evidence at hand, and that your
                                     profession is relevant to your
                                     refusal to consider that evidence. I
                                     understand completely why you dislike
                                     having your profession tied to your
                                     arguments here, but it isn’t an
                                     example of the ad hominem fallacy.
                                     You have previously identified the
                                     WHO as an example of scientific
                                     medical authority, and both that
                                     institution and the NIH promote
                                     acupuncture as a scientifically
                                     evidence-based medical intervention.
                                     So please spare me the “unscientific
                                     medical woo” rubbish. It has nothing
                                     to do with vaccine research and makes
                                     you seem desperate.
                                     My understanding, and please correct
                                     me if I’m wrong, is that they’ve
                                     found that acupuncture is a reliable
                                     way to induce the placebo effect. But
                                     interestingly, where one places the
                                     needles doesn’t make a difference to
                                     the outcome—in fact, one needn’t even
                                     actually leave the needles in the
                                     body so long as the patient believes
                                     they’re there. That makes acupuncture
                                     an interesting method of delivering
                                     the placebo effect, although I’m not
                                     sure there’s much need to get a
                                     graduate degree in it. I’m curious,
                                     does your education involve the
                                     concept of Qi? It’s a serious
                                     question, I’d like to know whether
                                     this is still a concept that
                                     acupuncturists rely on, or whether
                                     the field is distancing itself from
                                     its unscientific roots in the way
                                     that chiropractic is.
                                     By forcing me to point out the
                                     obvious, you’re making me come off as
                                     way more anti-research than I
                                     actually am.
                                     No, I think you’re painting a fairly
                                     accurate picture of your approach to
                                     research. Yes, bias exists. But of
                                     course, the fact that bias exists
                                     doesn’t justify reaching whatever
                                     wild conclusion you want to reach.
                                     It’s particularly absurd to conclude
                                     that there may be good, undiscovered
                                     evidence that vaccines cause autism
                                     when (a) there is no evidence of bias
                                     actually obstructing that specific
                                     conclusion, and particularly (b)
                                     there is a large body of alt-med
                                     practitioners with the motive and
                                     means to reach such a conclusion who
                                     have been unable to do so in any
                                     reliable way.
                                     Don’t read our reliance on
                                     professional research as an
                                     assumption that such research is
                                     perfect. No one assumes that, and in
                                     fact science invests an enormous
                                     amount of attention, energy, and
                                     infrastructure in the attempt to
                                     control biases and other errors. We
                                     assume those efforts will fail from
                                     time to time, and systematically. But
                                     that doesn’t invalidate the idea of
                                     scientific research, or create
                                     grounds for unscientific, false ideas
                                     to arrogate nonexistent empirical
                                     support to themselves.
                                     In other words, the fact that
                                     publication bias exists doesn’t mean
                                     that it’s unreasonable to conclude
                                     there’s no good evidence that Bigfoot
                                     exists, or that it is reasonable to
                                     claim that there is good evidence
                                     that he does. Those who have invested
                                     time and money in the Bigfoot
                                     industry will disagree, try to
                                     generate evidence supporting their
                                     preconceptions, and even post blog
                                     articles calling mainstream
                                     scientists liars. But the balance of
                                     evidence is still one-sided, and
                                     still reliable; it will take data,
                                     rather than ideology, to shift that.
                                     In lieu of such data, it’s
                                     unreasonable to conclude that Bigfoot
                                     exists or that vaccines cause autism.
                                     Now doctors and scientists, with the
                                     benefit of more data, better
                                     technology and a bit of hindsight,
                                     see that the way in which antibiotics
                                     have been used and are currently
                                     being used, while having saved many
                                     lives, have also endangered many
                                     other lives.
                                     You take my point, then miss it.
                                     Doctors and scientists, not bloggers
                                     or Natural News or nutritional
                                     supplement pushers. The doctors and
                                     scientists in this case, who have the
                                     greatest exposure to the data, the
                                     best training in understanding it,
                                     the strongest incentives to figure it
                                     out, and the most resources with
                                     which to do so, are virtually
                                     unanimous in their support of
                                     vaccination. They could theoretically
                                     change their minds one day on the
                                     basis of new evidence. But they
                                     haven’t yet.
                                     Every time I actually analyse the
                                     assumptions that have generated those
                                     conclusions, which is standard
                                     research practice, you say that I’m
                                     scaremongering.
                                     Yes. And I’ve explained why. And
                                     you’ve failed to justify your
                                     complaints, or your reliance on
                                     absolutely terrible research (which
                                     someone with your training should
                                     have been able to analyze more
                                     effectively). Your credentials don’t
                                     make you an expert, and experts’
                                     credentials don’t make them right.
                                     They simply enable experts to engage
                                     in a more effective and thorough
                                     analysis of the issue—which is
                                     something you’ve disclaimed for
                                     yourself. You keep telling us that
                                     you don’t know what the research
                                     says, you haven’t had time to read
                                     it, you aren’t familiar with the
                                     literature… but that doesn’t stop you
                                     from republishing scary anti-vax work
                                     to your readers, or attacking the
                                     research you say you haven’t
                                     reviewed. I think it’s more than
                                     reasonable to call that
                                     scaremongering.
                                     Can you offer me a reasonable
                                     explanation for why a narrative
                                     review, which is a far more bias-pone
                                     prone method, was conducted rather
                                     than a systematic review?
                                     I would assume that this is why the
                                     report noted that “the committee did
                                     not have the time or the resources to
                                     conduct formal reviews meeting all
                                     criteria for systematic reviews for
                                     each question of interest, nor did it
                                     find substantial evidence to conduct
                                     a quantitative synthesis.” I
                                     understand your underlying complaint
                                     to be that the committee did not
                                     publish a detailed description of
                                     their inclusion criteria—fair enough!
                                     I would have preferred that they did
                                     so. It’s a weakness in the report.
                                     But that weakness does not justify
                                     concluding that the review is
                                     inadequate or that the results are
                                     wrong. In fact, since they published
                                     their search terms and the papers
                                     they did review from the results, it
                                     would be possible to find out what
                                     they excluded. Interested parties, of
                                     which there are many, could still
                                     identify specifically what research
                                     the IOM rejected. They could identify
                                     specific problems with the IOM’s
                                     conclusions, rather than hunting for
                                     a justification for ignoring its
                                     inconvenient results. They, and you,
                                     haven’t.
                                     It’s perfectly reasonable to
                                     criticize the IOM report. I can’t
                                     imagine a 200-page report that didn’t
                                     have room for improvement. But your
                                     criticisms do not amount to a valid
                                     basis for complaining that the study,
                                     or the broader pro-vaccine consensus,
                                     are invalid.
                                     It is abundantly clear that your
                                     views about what the vaccine
                                     literature does and does not show are
                                     based on tragic personal experience
                                     and a need for things to be black and
                                     white – not based on how scientific
                                     research actually works.
                                     Perhaps you are addressing Chris
                                     here—I have been quite fortunate in
                                     life and suffered no infectious
                                     disease-related tragic personal
                                     experiences. My interest in anti-vax
                                     rhetoric is an outgrowth of my
                                     broader interest in the rhetorical
                                     and psychological context of
                                     irrationality. I’m writing a book on
                                     how irrational people, such as
                                     anti-vaxers, justify and evangelize
                                     their beliefs, and productive
                                     strategies for the mainstream in
                                     interacting with them. (My own
                                     comments to you have been rather
                                     harsher than I would normally
                                     recommend for such interaction; I
                                     have to admit your casual calumnies
                                     got my dander up.)
                                     The weaknesses in the evidence don’t
                                     mean that the conclusions are wrong.
                                     But saying that the weaknesses are
                                     not there because you’re firm in your
                                     conclusions is delusional.
                                     It certainly would be. I haven’t said
                                     that, and don’t believe it. I
                                     naturally expect all research to be
                                     flawed—it is, after all, a human
                                     endeavor. Simply stamping your foot
                                     and shouting that it’s flawed does
                                     not, however, amount to a substantive
                                     argument for any conclusion other
                                     than that it’s not perfect.
                                     You appear to have concluded that it
                                     is reasonable to believe, inter alia,
                                     that vaccines can cause autism, and
                                     that chelation can treat it. “The
                                     consensus research isn’t perfect”
                                     doesn’t validate those beliefs. You’d
                                     need some positive evidence to
                                     support them, and you’ve been so
                                     wildly unsuccessful in finding it
                                     that you’ve fallen back on the “just
                                     asking questions” strategy.
                                     I find it perfectly plausible that in
                                     spite of all of the valid points that
                                     I and many other researchers have
                                     made …
                                     You’re a researcher now? What do you
                                     research? Not vaccines—you were
                                     fairly adamant that you aren’t
                                     familiar with the research (despite
                                     having apparently come to some very
                                     firm conclusions about it).
                                     But by labelling any accurate
                                     identification of weaknesses, holes
                                     and uncertainties inherent in the
                                     scientific literature as
                                     “scaremongering”, you unnecessarily
                                     dumb down the whole conversation in a
                                     way that really detracts from your
                                     arguments, and gives easy ammunition
                                     to “anti-vaxers.”
                                     That would be a fair point, had you
                                     begun this discussion with “any
                                     accurate identification of
                                     weaknesses, holes and uncertainties
                                     inherent in the scientific
                                     literature.” You didn’t. You called
                                     Dr. Raff a liar and held up, for
                                     example, a flimsy piece of
                                     results-oriented research to support
                                     your apparent conclusion that there
                                     is adequate evidence that chelation
                                     treats autism. That’s scaremongering.
                                     You seem to be a man who requires
                                     certainty.
                                     Emphatically not. Practicing law
                                     taught me long ago that certainty is
                                     a lie; the truth is complex and
                                     smarter than we are. If I seem
                                     certain, it is because I have very
                                     high standards for such discussions,
                                     and you have consistently failed to
                                     meet them. “Just asking questions” is
                                     a tired and weak form of
                                     argumentation, and in your case
                                     increasingly transparent (although it
                                     was pretty transparent from the
                                     beginning—chelation, really?).

                                     Chris, to be honest, after your first
                                     couple of responses to me I stopped
                                     reading what you’d written for the
                                     most part. You demonstrated that you
                                     had no desire to have a rational,
                                     adult conversation with me. You
                                     started rapid firing demands for
                                     evidence to support claims that I
                                     never made and don’t believe. You
                                     started very quickly with lame
                                     personal attacks and one totally
                                     nonsensical argument “proving” that I
                                     hadn’t followed all of Dr Raff’s
                                     links (I had) because I accurately
                                     pointed out that most links pointed
                                     to unreferenced and non-scientific
                                     evidence. The evidence you gave for
                                     your claim was to highlight links
                                     from the post that are to original
                                     research. Surely, you can see that
                                     this number constitutes the minority?
                                     If you would like to engage in a
                                     discussion with me, where you respond
                                     to the points that I actually make, I
                                     could still be open to that. But if
                                     you’re only aim is to communicate
                                     your “passion” about the anti-Vax
                                     agenda, I have no interest. I don’t
                                     agree with many of their points or
                                     parts of their “agenda” so again, if
                                     you’d like to fight that fight,
                                     you’ll need to find someone else.
                                     Anti-vax
                                     I realise now that there has been an
                                     honest mis-understanding throughout
                                     this conversation regarding the
                                     designation “anti-vax”. I keep saying
                                     that I’m not “anti-vax” because I
                                     don’t oppose the use of vaccines. But
                                     according to this opinion piece by a
                                     real medical doctor
                                     (http://www.forbes.com/sites/robertpe
                                     arl/2014/03/20/a-doctors-take-on-the-
                                     anti-vaccine-movement/“), people in
                                     the anti-vaccine movement “continue
                                     to question the safety” of vaccines,
                                     and I’m clearly doing that. So I
                                     obviously fit that description,
                                     sincere apologies for the confusion,
                                     it was an honest mistake.
                                     But, it would be constructive if we
                                     could keep the discussion to the
                                     points I actually make and away from
                                     the wider “anti-vax agenda” as I
                                     can’t speak to it and don’t agree
                                     with all of their points.
                                     Is questioning vaccine safety
                                     irrational?
                                     Colin, you’ve said that you are
                                     writing a book concerning, in part,
                                     the irrationality of the anti-vaccine
                                     movement. I can’t speak to the
                                     movement as a whole, but I’d
                                     certainly like to address the
                                     question of whether or not
                                     questioning the safety of vaccines is
                                     irrational. This question seems to at
                                     the heart of everything that you’re
                                     arguing, is that fair to say?
                                     Your main arguments are (I am
                                     sincerely trying to represent you
                                     accurately and fairly, so please
                                     correct me if anything I’m saying is
                                     inaccurate):
                                     – We know that vaccines are safe and
                                     that adverse events are rare. We know
                                     this because this is the medical
                                     consensus as determined by
                                     researchers, doctors, and government
                                     agencies. Large reviews of the
                                     literature performed by various
                                     researchers and government agencies
                                     have concluded that vaccines are
                                     safe. Research isn’t perfect, as it
                                     is a human endeavor, but on the whole
                                     we can trust it. Therefor, as the
                                     experts say that vaccines are “safe,”
                                     questioning vaccine safety is
                                     irrational.
                                     Is that a fair representation?
                                     And from what I gather, the main
                                     arguments of the anti-anti-vaccine
                                     folks in general:
                                     1) Anti-vaxers accused the MMR and/or
                                     thimerosal of causing autism. But
                                     large swathes of studies have been
                                     performed and thoroughly disproved
                                     such a causal link. All of the
                                     research to support the opposing view
                                     is of low methodological quality and
                                     was produced by people with ulterior
                                     motives. So people who keep banging
                                     on about this are bonkers.
                                     2) The autism rate only seems to be
                                     rising due to more sensitive
                                     diagnostic criteria and greater
                                     awareness; in reality, it’s not
                                     actually rising.
                                     3) Vaccines have been thoroughly
                                     tested and they’ve been proven safe.
                                     Questioning this fact is unscientific
                                     and irrational.
                                     My main hypothesis, from genomic
                                     studies as well as biochemistry, has
                                     been that the vaccine schedule as a
                                     whole, while reducing the incidence
                                     (and mortality) of vaccine
                                     preventable illness, is a
                                     contributing factor in the increase
                                     in long-term health problems in the
                                     US. In other words, epigenetic
                                     studies demonstrate the effects of
                                     “environmental stressors” and how the
                                     accumulation of such stressors
                                     (toxins, antigens) can lead to
                                     disease. Vaccines clearly fit this
                                     description whether you are pro- or
                                     anti-; they exert their effects by
                                     exposing the individual to a group of
                                     antigens, and they contain exogenous
                                     compounds that the body needs to
                                     excrete safely. The question is
                                     whether this exposure (and I’m
                                     referring to the vaccine schedule,
                                     not individual vaccines or
                                     ingredients) is sufficient to
                                     contribute to illness on a
                                     population-wide basis. Epigenetic
                                     studies further suggest that it would
                                     be more likely to cause illness in
                                     some (those who already have a high
                                     toxic exposure and those who are
                                     genetically predisposed) and that for
                                     others it would not be sufficient to
                                     cause illness.
                                     The overwhelming majority of the
                                     counter-arguments I have received so
                                     far have not addressed these
                                     questions at all. But my main point
                                     is not that my hypothesis is correct;
                                     my main point is that asking the
                                     questions raised by my hypothesis is
                                     not irrational.
                                     Point 1, that the causal link between
                                     thimerosal/MMR and autism has been
                                     thoroughly disproven, does not
                                     address my points. Indeed, one of the
                                     most common pieces of “evidence” that
                                     thimerosal does not cause autism is
                                     that removing most of it from
                                     vaccines has not seen a drop in the
                                     incidence of new cases of autism.
                                     However, if we remove the focus from
                                     thimerosal as a single causative
                                     factor and look at the schedule as a
                                     whole, the relationship between
                                     thimerosal and health outcomes
                                     remains unelucidated because the
                                     studies do not control for the
                                     increase in the schedule subsequent
                                     to its removal or the possible
                                     effects of the adjuvants it was
                                     replaced with.
                                     Point 2 is simply not substantiated
                                     by the evidence or at least it’s
                                     certainly open to debate
                                     (Hertz-Picciotto 2009) – changing
                                     diagnositic criteria, greater
                                     awareness, and diagnosis of milder
                                     forms certainly play a role in the
                                     rising rate but does not seem to
                                     explain the entire increase.
                                     Point 3 – I go back to how you define
                                     safe. If safe is defined by how often
                                     the vaccine causes the illness
                                     against which it is intended to
                                     protect or by whether or not there is
                                     a causal relationship between MMR or
                                     thimerosal and autism, then I
                                     completely agree that vaccines have
                                     been proven safe. However, my first
                                     question regarding safety is whether
                                     or not the vaccine schedule as a
                                     whole is significantly contributing
                                     to the overall worsening health
                                     outcomes and the steep rise in
                                     chronic diseases. And my second
                                     question is do vaccines cause autism
                                     and other illness in a sub-set of the
                                     population. Neither of these
                                     questions has been adequately
                                     addressed in the vaccine safety
                                     literature. The most accurate answer
                                     to these questions is, “no one
                                     knows.”
                                     Is it rational to question medical
                                     consensus?
                                     One of your arguments has been that
                                     it’s irrational to question medical
                                     consensus. They’re the experts and
                                     suggesting the presence of a huge
                                     conspiracy theory is irrational.
                                     I would ask you, are there well
                                     established and accepted reasons
                                     explaining why the medical consensus
                                     would say that vaccines are safe even
                                     if that’s not the case? Are there
                                     rational reasons to question the
                                     medical consensus?
                                     – I’ve pointed to high-quality
                                     evidence about the frequent reversal
                                     of medical consensus, which you
                                     acknowledge
                                     – I’ve pointed out that the omission
                                     of negative results from trials,
                                     particularly when conducted by
                                     pharmaceutical companies, is
                                     pervasive and that reviews of the
                                     literature are inherently incomplete
                                     – I’ve pointed out that there are
                                     large concerns about conflict of
                                     interest that pervade vaccine safety
                                     research – people who are testing
                                     safety have significant reasons to
                                     over-estimate safety – which no one
                                     seems to deny
                                     – I was also previously familiar with
                                     studies on the quality of clinical
                                     guidelines for various conditions.
                                     Clinical guidelines epitomise medical
                                     consensus. Taking one medical
                                     condition, such as diabetes, Holmer
                                     et al found a large degree of
                                     variability around the quality of the
                                     guidelines as compared to the
                                     research evidence (Holmer 2013, plos)
                                     and most of this discrepancy was
                                     attributed to the amount of
                                     “editorial control” of the authors
                                     and suffered from a great deal of
                                     conflict of interest – pharmaceutical
                                     companies were able to exert large
                                     amount of control over the content of
                                     the guidelines. This finding is
                                     echoed by a previous study that
                                     demonstrated that authors of medical
                                     guidelines had significant ties to
                                     the pharmaceutical industry (Choudry
                                     2002, JAMA). So having been familiar
                                     with this literature before looking
                                     at the issue of vaccine safety, it is
                                     logical and rational that I would not
                                     accept the “medical consensus” on
                                     face value without further inquiry.
                                     It is not “irrational” to look
                                     further and examine what they are
                                     basing their conclusions on and how
                                     they are defining safety.
                                     So in light of these points, I feel
                                     that it is not irrational to question
                                     medical consensus in general and
                                     about vaccines in particular. This is
                                     certainly subjective, but in light of
                                     these points, I feel that it is
                                     irrational to take medical consensus
                                     at face value without looking further
                                     and hold it up as indisputable fact.
                                     Questioning medical consensus does
                                     not mean that you subscribe to a
                                     conspiracy theory or that you are
                                     trying to prove that it is wrong; it
                                     can come from an awareness of the
                                     factors other than best-evidence or
                                     other than an accurate identification
                                     of what’s actually occurring that
                                     lead to generating the consensus in
                                     the first place. These factors are
                                     well accepted and pervasive. They do
                                     not mean that consensus is inherently
                                     wrong or that we should give up on
                                     research and guidelines entirely,
                                     only that questioning how they
                                     arrived at their conclusions is
                                     logical and rational.
                                     So, as to my first question, does the
                                     vaccine schedule as a whole, while
                                     lowering the incidence of vaccine
                                     preventable illness, significantly
                                     contribute to the worsening health of
                                     the population?
                                     I’ve pointed out that the research
                                     that would answer questions about
                                     wider health outcomes in vaccinated
                                     vs unvaccinated populations has not
                                     been done: “few studies have
                                     comprehensively assessed the
                                     association between the entire
                                     immunization schedule or variations
                                     in the overall schedule and
                                     categories of health outcomes, and no
                                     study has directly examined health
                                     outcomes and stakeholder concerns in
                                     precisely the way that the committee
                                     was charged to address in its
                                     statement of task. No studies have
                                     compared the differences in health
                                     outcomes that some stakeholders
                                     questioned between entirely
                                     unimmunized populations of children
                                     and fully immunized children . . .
                                     The committee believes that although
                                     the available evidence is reassuring,
                                     studies designed to examine the
                                     long-term effects of the cumulative
                                     number of vaccines or other aspects
                                     of the immunization schedule have not
                                     been conducted (National Academies
                                     2013 report “The Childhood
                                     Immunization Schedule and Safety”)
                                     Are you really saying that voicing

                                     infallible, you and I both agree is
                                     of high quality, is irrational? Do
                                     you consider the report itself to be
                                     scaremongering by pointing out the
                                     research that hasn’t been done (while
                                     generally concluding that available
                                     evidence is reassuring)? If this
                                     document forms part of what you
                                     consider to be the medical consensus,
                                     is it rational for you to say that
                                     someone who shares concerns raised by
                                     it is being irrational by doing so?
                                     Chris, you linked to a report from
                                     the American Academy of Pediatrics
                                     entitled Vaccine Safety: Examine the
                                     Evidence. Four studies come under the
                                     heading “Studies About General Safety
                                     and Number of Vaccines”. The rest of
                                     the studies are irrelevant to this
                                     discussion.
                                     – The first study did not use
                                     unvaccinated controls.
                                     The second study actually found that
                                     an increase in vaccination is
                                     associated with improved
                                     neuropsychological outcomes,
                                     suggesting that vaccination actually
                                     makes you smarter and have a better
                                     personality! Of course, this
                                     association went away when they
                                     actually controlled for confounders
                                     (so why mentioned it in the abstract
                                     at all? Super silly). Anyways, again
                                     this design is not appropriate to
                                     answer the question.
                                     The third study, compared rates of
                                     adverse effects in vaccinated
                                     children with inborn errors of
                                     metabolism vs vaccinated healthy
                                     controls. Again, this design is not
                                     appropriate to answer the question as
                                     stated. But more concerningly, this
                                     study is full of methodological
                                     flaws. The authors say that they are
                                     looking at the rate of
                                     post-vaccination hospitalisations as
                                     one of their outcome measures but
                                     buried in the Methods section, they
                                     write: “We did not examine
                                     post-vaccination emergency-department
                                     and hospitalization rates among
                                     healthy children because children
                                     with IEMs (inborn errors of
                                     metabolism) are clinically very
                                     different, and comparing adverse
                                     events between 2 such clinically
                                     distinct populations would not have
                                     been suitable.” So the controls
                                     they’ve chosen are not suitable for
                                     their main outcome measure?
                                     What they actually compared was
                                     hospitalisations in the sick group 0
                                     – 30 days post-vax to hospitalisation
                                     31 – 60 days post-vax. This is very
                                     strange – the results section of the
                                     abstract says :“Comparing infants
                                     with inborn errors of metabolism (n
                                     =77) versus matched control subjects
                                     (n = 1540), similar proportions were
                                     up to date for vaccines at 2 years of
                                     age, and there was no evidence of
                                     delay in receipt of recommended
                                     vaccines during the first year.
                                     Vaccination of children with inborn
                                     errors of metabolism (n =271) was not
                                     associated with any significant
                                     increase in emergency-department
                                     visits or hospitalizations during the
                                     30 days after vaccination.” This is
                                     highly misleading. If you are going
                                     to bother to do a study comparing a
                                     sick population using a healthy
                                     sample population as a control for a
                                     chosen outcome, then you report what
                                     actually happened (I’m guessing the
                                     sick kids went to the hospital more)
                                     and then you explain reasons for this
                                     association in your analysis (e.g.
                                     “The higher rate of hospital visits
                                     in the sick population could be
                                     explained by the fact that there sick
                                     before they got vaccines” rather than
                                     use a population sample (sick kids)
                                     and a control group (healthy kids)
                                     and then compare hospitalisation
                                     rates between sick kids 0-30 days and
                                     sick kids 31-60. That’s a no no for a
                                     lot of reasons. And if you wanted to
                                     actually see what effect vaccinations
                                     had on children with IEM, you would
                                     compare a vaccinated IEM group to an
                                     unvaccinated IEM group. Anyways, the
                                     main point is, this study design does
                                     not answer the stated question.
                                     The fourth study is about measles
                                     containing vaccines, does not have an
                                     unvaccinated control, and is again,
                                     not relevant to the question.
                                     So, in summary, the document “Vaccine
                                     Safety: Examine the Evidence”,
                                     provides a list of vaccine safety
                                     studies, none of which are of
                                     appropriate design to answer the
                                     concern about the effects of the
                                     vaccine schedule on overall health as
                                     compared to unvaccinated controls. So
                                     I disagree with the statement that
                                     the concerns I raise, which are
                                     shared by the National Academies 2013
                                     report, have already been
                                     overwhelmingly addressed by the
                                     literature.
                                     My second hypothesis is that vaccines
                                     cause autism and other serious
                                     adverse reactions in a sub-set of the
                                     population and that population
                                     studies are not adequately segmented
                                     to pick this effect up. This view is
                                     echoed in the document “Adverse
                                     Effects of Vaccines: Evidence and
                                     Causality” 2012, National Academies
                                     (particularly in the section
                                     beginning on p 82: “In some
                                     metabolically vulnerable children,
                                     receiving vaccines may be the largely
                                     nonspecific “last straw” that leads
                                     these children to reveal their
                                     underlying genotype. It was recently
                                     discovered that a large majority of
                                     children who developed encephalopathy
                                     after receiving whole cell pertussis
                                     vaccine have mutations in SCN1A,
                                     which are associated with Dravet
                                     syndrome or severe myoclonic epilepsy
                                     of childhood (Berkovic et al., 2006;
                                     McIntosh et al., 2010). While it
                                     seems likely that the vaccine
                                     triggered symptoms in these children
                                     by causing high fever, the particular
                                     vaccine antigens do not appear to
                                     alter the course of the disease.
                                     Rather, the ensuing phenotype could
                                     and probably would have been
                                     precipitated by multiple other
                                     fever-inducing triggers (McIntosh et
                                     al., 2010; Wiznitzer, 2010).” The
                                     chart depicted on p83 is a really
                                     excellent representation of the
                                     factors impacting on the risk of AE
                                     and raises concerns about why
                                     vaccines are more likely to cause an
                                     increase in AEs over time – one way
                                     to look at it, is even if vaccines
                                     were not the original cause of the
                                     worsening health of children in the
                                     US, the fact that the health of our
                                     children is undeniably getting worse
                                     puts them at greater risk of AEs from
                                     vaccines (again, another legitimate
                                     reason for my concern about overall
                                     safety).
                                     A particular genetic abnormality that
                                     affects both autism and the ability
                                     to detoxify exogenous compounds is
                                     the MTHFR mutation. And indeed, while
                                     this area of research is in its
                                     infancy, links have been made between
                                     this mutation and serious AEs (Poland
                                     2009, Pediatric Infectious Disease
                                     Journal). When you consider that the
                                     homozygous form of this mutation is
                                     estimated to occur in 30% of the US
                                     population, you can see that
                                     elucidating what role, if any, it may
                                     be playing in this picture is
                                     significant. And of course, there are
                                     many other genes that play important
                                     roles in how children react to
                                     vaccines or their susceptibility to
                                     autism and again, this research is
                                     just beginning.
                                     So what’s the upshot of this? You
                                     have at least hundreds of reports in
                                     VAERS and other databases of
                                     developmental regression following
                                     immunization (Woo 2007, Autism). Dr
                                     Raff has put in her comment to Odee:
                                     “We humans are very good at seeing
                                     patterns, but sometimes that ability
                                     fools us. You can’t tell whether
                                     something caused something else from
                                     just one incident. It’s only when we
                                     look at thousands and thousands of
                                     cases that we’re able to eliminate
                                     different variables that might be
                                     complicating the story, and
                                     effectively figure out an answer to
                                     these questions.” I completely agree.
                                     But I’m unaware of any precedent in
                                     the modern medical literature for
                                     where a specific adverse event has
                                     been reported in temporal association
                                     with a medical intervention at a
                                     similar rate and that this
                                     relationship has been explained
                                     solely by chance.
                                     I would agree that if this
                                     relationship is not apparent at the
                                     population level, then it may not be
                                     strong. But there’s certainly a
                                     problem with telling parents who have
                                     identified regressive autism directly
                                     following vaccination that it’s a
                                     coincidence and that they’re
                                     associating these two occurrences
                                     because they’re overly emotional
                                     (“it’s all in your head”) when it’s
                                     far more likely that while some cases
                                     of autism following vaccines are
                                     coincidental, others are a direct
                                     effect of the vaccines “revealing
                                     their underlying genotype,” even if
                                     the rate at which this occurs is
                                     relatively small as compared to the
                                     number of vaccines administered.
                                     In sum, there are many logical,
                                     well-documented reasons why
                                     questioning medical authority is not
                                     irrational. Furthermore, while
                                     continuing to point to already
                                     thoroughly disproved associations
                                     (such as MMR/thimerosal and autism)
                                     could be considered irrational, the
                                     vaccine literature has not yet shown
                                     that vaccines as they are currently
                                     administered have been demonstrated
                                     to be safe: “Most vaccine-related
                                     research focuses on the outcomes of
                                     single immunizations or combinations
                                     of vaccines administered at a single
                                     visit. Although each new vaccine is
                                     evaluated in the context of the
                                     overall immunization schedule that
                                     existed at the time of review of that
                                     vaccine, elements of the schedule are
                                     not evaluated once it is adjusted to
                                     accommodate a new vaccine. Thus, key
                                     elements of the entire schedule—the
                                     number, frequency, timing, order, and
                                     age at administration of
                                     vaccines—have not been systematically
                                     examined in research studies.” (The
                                     Childhood Immunization Schedule and
                                     Safety, National Academies, 2013).
                                     Another way of putting this is that
                                     the body of literature as a whole has
                                     poor external validity as it does not
                                     reflect how vaccines are administered
                                     in practice.
                                     I am not saying that vaccines are
                                     unsafe and that we should not use
                                     them. But I think I’ve made a
                                     compelling argument that, even if you
                                     reject the suggestion that the
                                     vaccine schedule as a whole may be
                                     related to worsening health outcomes
                                     (based on what evidence, I’d be
                                     interested to see) questioning their
                                     safety in itself is not irrational.
                                   o Chris July 29, 2014 at 10:53 am
                                     I don’t have the time nor the
                                     patience to go through your latest
                                     diatribe, especially since you think
                                     I don’t know a thing about science or
                                     the issues. Despite the fact that in
                                     my engineering career I had to use
                                     science, read papers, critique test
                                     results from vendors (many of whom
                                     had failed to read the actual
                                     required test procedure) and even
                                     write a few reports to convince
                                     skeptical supervisors and customers
                                     that my analyses of structural
                                     systems accurately showed how they
                                     behaved and did not become
                                     dynamically unstable. Nor the fact
                                     that I have been dealing the medical
                                     issues of my kids, including the one
                                     who needed protection from pertussis
                                     in a community with low community
                                     immunity. That includes dealing with
                                     the anti-vaccine crowd for over
                                     fifteen years (see * below).
                                     (you can be sure that on the way to
                                     learning how to solve multivariable
                                     nonlinear second order differential
                                     equations and do Fourier transforms,
                                     I did learn how to take a simple
                                     ratio of “total number of vaccine
                                     doses given” versus “number of
                                     compensated claims”, you might want
                                     to figure out how I did that).
                                     But I will note that you claimed: “To
                                     my credit, I still haven not visited
                                     any “anti-vax” websites, where I’m
                                     sure I could find arguments that
                                     others have made and repeat those.
                                     Everything I have written or cited is
                                     based on my own research, such as it
                                     is.”
                                     Yet, you have been using several
                                     common anti-vax claims, including
                                     this one: “Department of Health, the
                                     Vaccine Injury Compensation Program
                                     has paid out $2.7 billion in
                                     compensation for vaccine injuries
                                     (http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecom…
                                     and..”
                                     Yes, they keep making the claim but
                                     they never actually look at the
                                     NVICP’s statistical webpage, plus the
                                     link you included was incomplete.
                                     Either you cut and pasted it from
                                     some anti-vax website, or you tried
                                     to copy it from the actual “.gov”
                                     website, but mucked it up. Perhaps
                                     you did not understand how to read
                                     the tables, or just did not even look
                                     at them.
                                     Add to that you cited some very bad
                                     papers by a practitioner who
                                     convinces desparate parents to pay
                                     for his quackery, and a pair of
                                     researchers who were paid by anti-vax
                                     groups to do their bad statistics
                                     (and you thought studies done by “Big
                                     Pharma” were bad!). Then have the
                                     temerity to post “research is wrong,
                                     science changes, they did the science
                                     wrong, no unvaccinated controls!”
                                     diatribes.
                                     Perhaps you are just being lazy, or
                                     dishonest. One or the other. Needless
                                     to say, you have proven to not have a
                                     clue and are therefore in no position
                                     to “edumacate” Dr. Raff, or anyone
                                     else in this discussion.
                                     But lets see what howlers you have
                                     today: “Chris, you linked to a report
                                     from the American Academy of
                                     Pediatrics entitled Vaccine Safety:
                                     Examine the Evidence. Four studies
                                     come under the heading “Studies About
                                     General Safety and Number of
                                     Vaccines”. The rest of the studies
                                     are irrelevant to this discussion.
                                     – The first study did not use
                                     unvaccinated controls.”
                                     This has been explained to you by
                                     Colin, though the rest shows you
                                     still do not have a clue on how to
                                     read a paper about human subject
                                     studies (use the “search thingy” to
                                     learn about the Belmont Report). By
                                     the way, that first study in the list
                                     was to answer the “too many to soon”
                                     question, you might actually try
                                     reading it through.
                                     But then there is this: “You have at
                                     least hundreds of reports in VAERS
                                     and other databases of developmental
                                     regression following immunization
                                     (Woo 2007, Autism).” Another common
                                     anti-vax claim. I know you won’t even
                                     bother, but go to the official VAERS
                                     database portal with the “.gov” URL
                                     and tell us what you need to read and
                                     understand about using. Or just take
                                     a basic statistic course to
                                     understand the validity of
                                     self-selected surveys. It is zilch,
                                     which is why VAERS is only a small
                                     part of the CDC Vaccine Safety
                                     Database Project, which I have
                                     actually mentioned to you. That
                                     database was sensitive enough to see
                                     a safety issue with the first
                                     rotavirus vaccine, RotaShield.
                                     In the late 1990s I joined an email
                                     listserv specific to my son’s
                                     disability. It went well for while,
                                     and then at that turn of the century
                                     the anti-vax bunch came. They took
                                     over, and one even tried to get me
                                     booted off because I pointed out that
                                     the MMR vaccine has never contained
                                     thimerosal. They really really pushed
                                     chelation. I researched it, and even
                                     contacted the FDA for information
                                     (not helpful), and then got lots of
                                     nasty grams for writing an email
                                     explaining that chelation was a bad
                                     idea. So I left that listserv. Just a
                                     week later a little boy was cleanly
                                     executed by chelation just because
                                     his crime was being born with autism:

                                     Mel, people aren’t calling you
                                     anti-vax because you “question the
                                     safety of vaccines.” People are
                                     calling you anti-vax because you’re
                                     using deceptive rhetoric to scare
                                     people about vaccines. As has been
                                     explained to you many times, “just
                                     asking questions” is not the same
                                     thing as seriously investigating the
                                     safety or efficacy of vaccines. One
                                     key distinction is that rather than
                                     looking at the totality of the
                                     evidence, you cherry-picked anti-vax
                                     research and held it up as somehow
                                     equivalent to the total body of
                                     scientific research, and even
                                     admitted that you did so without
                                     critical thinking or analysis. You
                                     didn’t do that because you’re curious
                                     about whether vaccines are safe and
                                     effective, you did it to create the
                                     impression that there’s an open
                                     question as to how safe and
                                     effective.
                                     Seriously questioning the safety of
                                     anything is, or at least can be,
                                     rational. But refusing to accept an
                                     answer that is clear, unambiguous,
                                     and supported by the scientific
                                     evidence simply because it’s
                                     inconvenient to your philosophy on
                                     “natural” health and healing is
                                     irrational.
                                     Your summary of the arguments is
                                     pretty good—hardly perfect, but of
                                     course it can’t be since you’re
                                     trying to summarize the positions of
                                     various individuals who will have
                                     their own individual takes on any
                                     particular question. Anyway, I
                                     appreciate the effort as a fan of the
                                     Ideological Turing Test
                                     (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideolog
                                     ical_Turing_Test).
                                     Your own position seems to be wild
                                     speculation. Your position is
                                     irrational, in my eyes, because you
                                     appear to be stuck on it despite the
                                     lack of supporting evidence or even
                                     any significant detail in your theory
                                     of vaccines somehow causing
                                     unspecified damage in an unspecified
                                     way for unspecified reasons. If you
                                     can’t demonstrate that your position
                                     is true, and significant evidence
                                     (such as the fact that autism rates
                                     don’t track vaccination rates)
                                     indicates that it isn’t, then it’s
                                     irrational to insist that your
                                     questions are valid.
                                     In other words, there is some
                                     evidence that autism rates closely
                                     correspond to the uptake of organic
                                     foods:
                                     http://kfolta.blogspot.com/2013/02/or
                                     ganic-food-causes-autism.html. I
                                     believe that organic foods therefore
                                     cause autism. I don’t have any good
                                     evidence for that theory, just a
                                     correlation. And there is a lot of
                                     evidence against it. And it isn’t
                                     particularly biologically plausible.
                                     And the scientific community thinks
                                     the theory is risible. So far, our
                                     two theories are neck and neck. They
                                     aren’t serious questions.
                                     However, if we remove the focus from
                                     thimerosal as a single causative
                                     factor and look at the schedule as a
                                     whole, the relationship between
                                     thimerosal and health outcomes
                                     remains unelucidated because the
                                     studies do not control for the
                                     increase in the schedule subsequent
                                     to its removal or the possible
                                     effects of the adjuvants it was
                                     replaced with.
                                     The other adjuvants have also been
                                     tested, and they don’t cause autism,
                                     either. Or did you have any
                                     particular scientific reason to
                                     believe that they do? This is just
                                     more “just asking questions” – your
                                     first theory is debunked, so you
                                     shifted to another question to
                                     maintain your default opposition to
                                     the vaccination schedule.
                                     As for the increasing number of
                                     autism diagnoses, I don’t know enough
                                     about the question to have an
                                     educated opinion. But if autism
                                     incidence is actually increasing, I
                                     blame organic food. It correlates
                                     much more closely with the increase
                                     in autism rates, after all. And it’s
                                     known that food can stress the immune
                                     system, just ask a kid with peanut
                                     allergies. And epigenetics tells us
                                     that immune stresses and toxins can
                                     cause certain kinds of damage. And no
                                     one has ever tested the increase in
                                     organic food consumption to see
                                     whether it causes autism! No one has
                                     ever even done a controlled, double
                                     blind study of organic food eaters
                                     versus non-organic food eaters to see
                                     whether organic food is safe.
                                     [M]y first question regarding safety
                                     is whether or not the vaccine
                                     schedule as a whole is significantly
                                     contributing to the overall worsening
                                     health outcomes and the steep rise in
                                     chronic diseases.
                                     If there was good evidence that
                                     vaccines were doing that, I’d say
                                     they weren’t very safe. You have
                                     neglected to provide any; your
                                     complaints seem based on something
                                     other than empirical evidence.
                                     And my second question is do vaccines
                                     cause autism and other illness in a
                                     sub-set of the population.
                                     Is that question based on any
                                     evidence that they do, or even an
                                     empirical reason to suspect that they
                                     might? Or is it based on your
                                     cultural identification with the
                                     “natural” healing community, which
                                     has become affiliated with this
                                     position?
                                     Is it rational to question medical
                                     consensus?
                                     It depends on the question. It
                                     becomes irrational when the questions
                                     are asked for ideological rather than
                                     investigative reasons and when the
                                     questioner is disinterested in the
                                     answers.
                                     Your points about medical consensus
                                     are based on a logical fallacy. The
                                     fact that consensus can change, and
                                     the fact that it can be wrong, are
                                     not in dispute. But they don’t
                                     support the position that the
                                     consensus will change, or is wrong.
                                     It would take data to do that, which
                                     is what the anti-vax community has
                                     been trying and failing to develop
                                     for decades. In lieu of such data,
                                     they “just ask questions,” which is
                                     an effective strategy since rhetoric
                                     is often more persuasive than
                                     science.
                                     So in light of these points, I feel
                                     that it is not irrational to question
                                     medical consensus in general and
                                     about vaccines in particular.
                                     It would be rational if your goal was
                                     to actually investigate the truth of
                                     the consensus. But this has been
                                     tested, remember? You opened up this
                                     conversation by calling Dr. Raff a
                                     liar for telling her readers what the
                                     consensus is, then holding up some
                                     atrocious research to persuade your
                                     readers that, inter alia, there is
                                     reason to believe that vaccines cause
                                     autism and that chelation treats it.
                                     It’s rational to ask open questions
                                     to find out answers. It’s irrational
                                     to ask leading questions for the
                                     purpose of persuading people that a
                                     certain answer is true, when the
                                     evidence doesn’t support that answer.
                                     You’ve been doing the latter, rather
                                     than the former—your piece is
                                     advocacy rather than analysis.
                                     Your first “hypothesis” appears to be
                                     supported by absolutely no evidence
                                     whatsoever. None. Your entire
                                     argument is to nitpick four or five
                                     specific scientific studies, while
                                     pretending—falsely—that the NA report
                                     shares your concerns. On the
                                     contrary, while it describes the
                                     state of the current research, it
                                     specifically notes that the committee
                                     believes the current evidence is
                                     reassuring. There is a world of
                                     difference between, “we should study
                                     this question in more detail” and
                                     “there is reason to believe that the
                                     vaccine schedule is causing
                                     unspecified bad chronic illnesses for
                                     unspecified reasons in unspecified
                                     ways in unspecified subgroups.” It
                                     would be completely fair and
                                     reasonable to want more detailed
                                     studies, whether or not they were
                                     feasible. Your “hypothesis,” on the
                                     other hand, in the absence of any
                                     positive evidence to support it, is
                                     scaremongering—“just asking
                                     questions” as a substitute for such
                                     evidence, with the goal of persuading
                                     readers that vaccines cause autism
                                     and other unspecified chronic
                                     problems.
                                     Your second “hypothesis” is similarly
                                     mere advocacy. You slyly imply that
                                     the NA report found that vaccines
                                     “cause autism and other serious
                                     adverse reactions in a sub-set of the
                                     population,” but that’s not true. The
                                     report specifically recommends
                                     rejecting the conclusion that
                                     vaccines cause autism. And the
                                     specific section you quoted isn’t
                                     referring to autism at all, but (as
                                     far as I can tell) known adverse
                                     events. This is an excellent example
                                     of using a “hypothesis” to distort
                                     the evidence and mislead readers. I’m
                                     reminded, once again, of something
                                     underlying all our discussions: a
                                     reader of Dr. Raff’s piece would walk
                                     away with an accurate impression of
                                     the overall scientific evidence on
                                     this question. A reader of your
                                     comments would walk away with
                                     critical misunderstandings that, not
                                     coincidentally, would favor your
                                     ideological biases.
                                     So what’s the upshot of this? You
                                     have at least hundreds of reports in
                                     VAERS and other databases of
                                     developmental regression following
                                     immunization (Woo 2007, Autism).
                                     There are also reports in VAERS of
                                     vaccines causing Incredible Hulk
                                     syndrome and car crashes. It’s a
                                     database of correlations, not
                                     causative events.
                                     But I’m unaware of any precedent in
                                     the modern medical literature for
                                     where a specific adverse event has
                                     been reported in temporal association
                                     with a medical intervention at a
                                     similar rate and that this
                                     relationship has been explained
                                     solely by chance.
                                     “Solely by chance” is the misleading
                                     element here. It’s not solely by
                                     chance. Many parents have been
                                     mislead by scary anti-vaccine
                                     rhetoric like yours. When they see
                                     regression in their autistic
                                     children, they look for a reason for
                                     it, and lots of bloggers are happy to
                                     give it to them. They remember, with
                                     a little help, that sure enough it
                                     was that evil vaccine that caused the
                                     first signs of regression. You can
                                     actually see this process if you
                                     google Jenny McCarthy’s anti-vax
                                     stories; her own mother eventually
                                     came clean and admitted that no,
                                     there were signs of a neurological
                                     event long before the child was
                                     vaccinated. These parents aren’t
                                     lying, of course, but human memory is
                                     notoriously and obviously flexible.
                                     We distort it constantly without
                                     meaning to, and despite our best
                                     efforts to remember things (even the
                                     most important things) accurately. In
                                     other words, the reported correlation
                                     isn’t due solely to chance. There’s a
                                     nonrandom influence that biases
                                     parents of autistic children to
                                     report regression as an adverse
                                     event. In this case, that influence
                                     goes by the name “Mel.”
                                     But there’s certainly a problem with
                                     telling parents who have identified
                                     regressive autism directly following
                                     vaccination that it’s a coincidence
                                     and that they’re associating these
                                     two occurrences because they’re
                                     overly emotional (“it’s all in your
                                     head”) when it’s far more likely that
                                     while some cases of autism following
                                     vaccines are coincidental, others are
                                     a direct effect of the vaccines
                                     “revealing their underlying
                                     genotype,” even if the rate at which
                                     this occurs is relatively small as
                                     compared to the number of vaccines
                                     administered.
                                     If there were a way to bottle irony
                                     and sell it, you’d make us all rich
                                     as Croesus. What on earth supports
                                     your contention that “it’s far more
                                     likely that . . . others are a direct
                                     effect of the vaccines”? Not
                                     evidence. There’s no data supporting
                                     this supposition. It’s just wild
                                     guesswork. You want parents to blame
                                     vaccines for autism even though you
                                     have no evidence to support that
                                     theory, while complaining about
                                     parents being told truthfully that
                                     the data don’t support a causative
                                     link between autism and vaccines.
                                     Again (and again, and again, and
                                     again) the more someone listens to
                                     your position on vaccines, the more
                                     misled they would be about what that
                                     evidence says.
                                     But I think I’ve made a compelling
                                     argument that, even if you reject the
                                     suggestion that the vaccine schedule
                                     as a whole may be related to
                                     worsening health outcomes (based on
                                     what evidence, I’d be interested to
                                     see) questioning their safety in
                                     itself is not irrational.
                                     If you were questioning their safety
                                     in order to determine an answer, I
                                     would agree. You aren’t. You’re “just
                                     asking questions” to push your
                                     readers to a certain conclusion—one
                                     that happens to correspond with your
                                     ideological biases. So you ignore
                                     research and evidence that conflicts
                                     with those biases, while implying
                                     falsely that there is solid research
                                     on the other side of the table. For
                                     example, on your own site you still
                                     have your piece up misleadingly
                                     suggesting to your readers that there
                                     is good research supporting the
                                     belief that mercury in vaccines
                                     causes autism, and that chelation
                                     treats it. You’ve since admitted that
                                     you never actually thought critically
                                     about those studies—but you’re more
                                     than happy for your readers to walk
                                     away from your article with
                                     misapprehensions about them. If you
                                     were asking questions to get answers,
                                     I think you wouldn’t be ignoring and
                                     distorting the evidence so blatantly.

                                     something. And I think that you seem
                                     to have an aversion to admitting when
                                     you make a mistake, not a

                                     especially when you’re trying to
                                     convince me that I should trust your
                                     judgment when it comes to injecting
                                     known neurotoxins into babies.

                                     the stated outcome measures, is it
                                     safe to say that you think that all
                                     studies that show that vaccines are
                                     safe are by definition

                                     asked that if nothing else, you keep
                                     your comments relevant to the
                                     discussion. In case you’ve lost the
                                     thread, I’m asking you to point me to
                                     the scientific evidence (preferably
                                     of good quality, but at this point, I
                                     won’t be picky) that demonstrates
                                     that vaccines are safe in the long
                                     term where the study design tests
                                     vaccine administration in a way that
                                     even roughly approximates what
                                     actually happens in practice.
                                     And to my new friend, Colin:
                                     “In other words, there is some
                                     evidence that autism rates closely
                                     correspond to the uptake of organic
                                     foods:

                                     ganic-food-causes-autism.html. I
                                     believe that organic foods therefore
                                     cause autism. I don’t have any good
                                     evidence for that theory, just a
                                     correlation. And there is a lot of
                                     evidence against it. And it isn’t
                                     particularly biologically plausible.
                                     And the scientific community thinks
                                     the theory is risible. So far, our
                                     two theories are neck and neck. They
                                     aren’t serious questions.”
                                     Oh, dear me, I hadn’t realised that
                                     correlation doesn’t equal causation.
                                     Well, if the government had developed
                                     a policy based on research provided
                                     by the organic food industry that all
                                     babies and children in the United
                                     States, with rare exception, had to
                                     consume only organic foods in order
                                     to be allowed to go to school (if
                                     only) then your theory would
                                     certainly be worth pursuing, in fact
                                     it would be unethical not to. And of
                                     course, we’d hope that the government
                                     had tested the entirety of the
                                     recommended diet, and not just parts
                                     of it, before mandating it to our
                                     children on a national scale to make
                                     sure it was safe – not doing so is
                                     potentially dangerous and totally
                                     irresponsible.
                                     As that’s not the case, then if we
                                     wanted to find out if your theory
                                     that organic foods do indeed cause
                                     autism is correct, we could start by
                                     looking at autism trends in children
                                     who consume only organic foods vs
                                     children consuming only non-organic
                                     foods while controlling for
                                     confounders and see if there are any
                                     significant differences. And if we
                                     saw significant differences in the
                                     two groups, we could even do
                                     randomized studies to get a more
                                     accurate appraisal of cause and
                                     effect. It’s really not complicated.
                                     How great is it that we possess the
                                     scientific methods to answer such an
                                     important question.
                                     “Your own position seems to be wild
                                     speculation. Your position is
                                     irrational, in my eyes, because you
                                     appear to be stuck on it despite the
                                     lack of supporting evidence”
                                     No, see, that’s just the thing. I’m
                                     not saying that I know vaccines make
                                     kids sick because there’s a
                                     correlation between our huge vaccine
                                     schedule and our shitty health
                                     outcomes. I’m saying that I don’t
                                     need to provide you evidence of
                                     danger, you need to provide me with
                                     evidence of safety. You have failed
                                     to provide me with a single study
                                     that looks at the safety of vaccines
                                     in a way that even remotely resembles
                                     how they are actually administered in
                                     practice. The best you could do is
                                     say that “experts say they’re safe.”
                                     You’re saying to me that in order to
                                     be a good parent and a good citizen,
                                     I need to take my kid to the doctor
                                     and have them injected with a load of
                                     antigens, neurotoxins, and
                                     preservatives. I am not saying to you
                                     that I’m sat on stacks of evidence
                                     that prove that this could make my
                                     kid stupid, sad, and sick. I’m asking
                                     you to provide me the evidence to
                                     support your assertion that this is
                                     safe. The burden of proof is on you
                                     to support your position, not on me
                                     to justify asking questions about how
                                     you got to your position.
                                     “In lieu of such data, they “just ask
                                     questions,” which is an effective
                                     strategy since rhetoric is often more
                                     persuasive than science.”
                                     You know what’s even more persuasive
                                     than asking questions? Answering
                                     those questions with data. Rather
                                     than showing me safety research that
                                     even remotely resembles what gets
                                     injected in a single visit, you keep
                                     describing my arguments back to me
                                     and talking about my tactics and my
                                     ideology, continuously identifying my
                                     questions as “questions” (seriously,
                                     is that what they teach you at law
                                     school?) without actually answering
                                     my questions. It’s really simple,
                                     make like Jerry McGuire and show me
                                     the research.
                                     At a 12 month appointment, a baby may
                                     receive in a single visit: Hep B,
                                     Flu, Pneuomococcal, Polio, MMR,
                                     Chicken pox, Hep A and others on the
                                     same day. Please, I beseach you,
                                     point me to a single safety study
                                     that looks at the effects of this
                                     combination? Seriously, my search
                                     thingy is giving me absolutely zilch
                                     (and I actually have access to
                                     research behind the pay wall because
                                     I’m a real researcher). Regarding
                                     this practice as the administration
                                     of 7 separate interventions that are
                                     known to be safe is simply not based
                                     in any shared reality – the human
                                     body doesn’t care what you call it,
                                     all it knows is what’s been injected
                                     into it that day. Shut me up by
                                     showing me one single safety study on
                                     this combination. Seriously, it’s a
                                     really simple ask.
                                     You keep saying, “You’re being
                                     irrational, there’s loads of
                                     research, this question has been
                                     answered.” Great, I’m relieved, show
                                     me. You’ve pointed to a big pile of
                                     research and some very nicely typeset
                                     summaries of this research that I’ve
                                     accurately identified as having very
                                     poor external validity. No
                                     toxicologist, immunologist, or
                                     biochemist on the planet would tell
                                     you that we know that injecting a
                                     baby with 8 vaccines at once is safe
                                     based on the fact that we’ve done
                                     safety studies when using 3 vaccines.
                                     On that, there is medical consensus.
                                     So please, this is your big
                                     opportunity to win the discussion
                                     once and for all. You claim that I’m
                                     letting my “ideological” position
                                     that injecting babies with known
                                     neurotoxins doesn’t seem very clever
                                     on the face of it cloud my senses so
                                     that I’m ignoring all the research
                                     that tests the safety of what
                                     actually gets injected into a baby
                                     when they visit the doctor’s. Show me
                                     this research.
                                     I am asking questions. I question
                                     vaccine safety. I am ideologically
                                     opposed to untested combinations of
                                     ingredients being injected into
                                     babies. None of these things need to
                                     be pointed out in your response. Just
                                     show me a single safety study on the
                                     actual combination that gets
                                     administered at once, and you, sir,
                                     will have check mated me.

                                     Mel, one major distinction between
                                     death from chelation and death from
                                     conventional medicine is that
                                     conventional medicine is legitimately
                                     intended to treat illness. Chelation,
                                     at least as used as a treatment for
                                     autism, is virtually impossible to
                                     defend—it’s a wild, unethical and
                                     dangerous experiment at best, and a
                                     deadly scam at worst. When someone
                                     suffers a deadly side effect to
                                     conventional medicine it’s typically
                                     despite the strenuous precautions of
                                     legitimate doctors. These snake oil
                                     salesmen chelating kids are something
                                     else entirely. Please see, for
                                     example, the details of the lawsuit
                                     dogging the researcher whose work
                                     you’re promoting in your latest blog
                                     piece.
                                     (Earlier you were defending your
                                     promotion of that research by saying
                                     you hadn’t bothered to read or think
                                     critically about it. You’ve had
                                     plenty of time to do so now, and
                                     you’ve chosen to keep promoting it
                                     via your website. Have you come down
                                     on the side of chelation as a
                                     legitimate treatment for autism?)
                                     And of course, we’d hope that the
                                     government had tested the entirety of
                                     the recommended diet, and not just
                                     parts of it, before mandating it to
                                     our children on a national scale to
                                     make sure it was safe – not doing so
                                     is potentially dangerous and totally
                                     irresponsible. As that’s not the
                                     case, then if we wanted to find out
                                     if your theory that organic foods do
                                     indeed cause autism is correct, we
                                     could start by looking at autism
                                     trends in children who consume only
                                     organic foods vs children consuming
                                     only non-organic foods while
                                     controlling for confounders and see
                                     if there are any significant
                                     differences.
                                     Your constant complaints about the
                                     testing regimen belie—once again—your
                                     pretense of being anything other than
                                     a typical anti-vaxer. You aren’t
                                     asking questions to find answers,
                                     you’re asking them to try to persuade
                                     readers that vaccines are dangerous
                                     and should be avoided.
                                     We often compare anti-vax rhetoric to
                                     a campaign against seatbelts. “Sure,
                                     scientists have tested seatbelts in
                                     individual crashes, but have they
                                     ever tested whether wearing seatbelts
                                     every day for a year causes autism?
                                     No! And seatbelts can constrict blood
                                     supply, and hypoxia is a known cause
                                     of encephalopathy! So I’m not saying
                                     I’m anti-seatbelt, I’m just asking
                                     questions about whether anyone has
                                     proven that wearing seatbelts every
                                     day doesn’t cause autism. Because
                                     until someone does a trial comparing
                                     safety outcomes of the seatbelted
                                     versus unseatbelted population over a
                                     year’s time, then the government
                                     scientists who are funded by the auto
                                     industry haven’t even tried to prove
                                     that seatbelts don’t prove autism.
                                     I’m just asking questions! About how
                                     the research doesn’t not show how
                                     seatbelts cause autism.”
                                     If you were asking questions because
                                     you were curious about the answers,
                                     or for any reason other than to make
                                     a rhetorical point, I think you would
                                     have considered the answers to your
                                     questions by now. Scientists can’t
                                     deprive kids of vaccines with proven
                                     safety and efficacy records for the
                                     sake of research—it would be
                                     grotesquely unethical. And there’s
                                     not much point to it when safety
                                     studies have never found reason to
                                     believe that the vaccine schedule is
                                     dangerous.
                                     You keep insisting that there’s
                                     reason to believe vaccines are
                                     dangerous in lieu of a total study of
                                     the schedule, but you’re omitting an
                                     important part of a serious inquiry:
                                     reason to think the schedule might be
                                     dangerous. You haven’t identified any
                                     biologically plausible mechanism for
                                     harm, or any reason to think that
                                     harm is actually occurring.
                                     Post-licensure and population studies
                                     haven’t found reason to believe that
                                     the vaccine schedule causes those
                                     harms. Woo-peddlers with huge
                                     financial incentives to find such
                                     harm, and the resources to search for
                                     it, haven’t been able to identify
                                     any.
                                     Given the enormous expense and
                                     difficulty of studying a vaccine
                                     schedule that changes fairly often,
                                     and the enormous amount of study that
                                     goes into determining the safety and
                                     efficacy of individual vaccines, and
                                     the lack of evidence of harm for the
                                     vaccine schedule overall, and the
                                     inability of anti-vaxers such as
                                     yourself to identify a biologically
                                     plausible mechanism for harm, I don’t
                                     think it’s unusual or problematic
                                     that there aren’t studies of the
                                     schedule overall.
                                     I’m assuming, by the way, that there
                                     aren’t such studies. I’m loathe to
                                     take the word of anti-vaxers on such
                                     topics because I’ve been burned
                                     before. But I’m usually willing to
                                     accept such representations arguendo.
                                     I’m assuming, therefore, that you
                                     have reason for disregarding the
                                     studies listed here:
                                     https://www2.aap.org/immunization/fam
                                     ilies/faq/vaccinestudies.pdf
                                     Smith 2010 concluded, for example,
                                     “that on-time receipt of vaccines
                                     during infancy has no adverse effect
                                     on neurodevelopmental outcomes 7 to
                                     10 years later.” Or DeStefano 2013,
                                     in J. Peds., which analyzed vaccine
                                     exposure over the first 2 years of
                                     participants’ lives and concluded
                                     there was no increased risk of ASD?
                                     You’re also asking us to ignore the
                                     IOM report, which you disparage
                                     without coming to terms with the
                                     conclusion of the experts on the
                                     committee: having reviewed the
                                     existing data, there was no
                                     particular reason to believe the
                                     vaccine schedule is unsafe.
                                     I’m saying that I don’t need to
                                     provide you evidence of danger, you
                                     need to provide me with evidence of
                                     safety.
                                     Are you going to stop wearing your
                                     seatbelt? Or eating organic food? Or
                                     giving acupuncture? Or riding in
                                     elevators? Or taking pressurized
                                     airplane rides? Or wearing synthetic
                                     fibers? Or walking on poured
                                     concrete? Or sitting under
                                     fluorescent lights? Or drinking
                                     freeze-dried tea? Or using
                                     stainless-steel utensils? No one has
                                     provided evidence of the safety of
                                     those things over time! Sure, maybe
                                     they’ve done some one-off safety
                                     studies—acupuncture isn’t any more
                                     dangerous than most biologically
                                     inactive placebos for any one
                                     treatment—but no one has shown you
                                     evidence of safety for an entire
                                     year’s worth of seatbelts, organic
                                     meals, acupuncture sessions, airplane
                                     rides or elevators. Surely you have
                                     the same questioning spirit for those
                                     things you do for vaccines. You don’t
                                     just reserve your hostility for a
                                     medical treatment that challenges the
                                     preconceptions of your
                                     natural-healing business, do you?
                                     Meanwhile, as you’re fretting over
                                     the quality of serious medical
                                     research, you’re still giving a pass
                                     to the alt-med work touted on your
                                     blog. Do you intend to revise your
                                     piece and clarify whether the
                                     pro-chelation research is reliable?
                                     Do you have on opinion on that point
                                     yet? I ask because your standards
                                     seem very highly situational:
                                     research that supports vaccination
                                     will never be good enough to overcome
                                     your hostility, but research
                                     skeptical of the scientific consensus
                                     on vaccines needs no critical
                                     analysis whatsoever.

                                     “At a 12 month appointment, a baby
                                     may receive in a single visit: Hep B,
                                     Flu, Pneuomococcal, Polio, MMR,
                                     Chicken pox, Hep A and others on the
                                     same day. Please, I beseach you,
                                     point me to a single safety study
                                     that looks at the effects of this
                                     combination?”
                                     And yet another common and
                                     nonsensical anti-vax complaint.
                                     Actually you been shown those, and
                                     even commented on one. You showed how
                                     well you understand human medical
                                     research because you complained that
                                     it did not violate the Belmont
                                     Report. And it is amusing that a
                                     resident of the UK is complaining
                                     about vaccines not offered by the
                                     NHS. At least one of those a parent
                                     has to find and pay for in England
                                     and Wales.
                                     “(and I actually have access to
                                     research behind the pay wall because
                                     I’m a real researcher).”
                                     LOL Obviously without any clue on how
                                     to do epidemiology, statistics, or
                                     thinks that 1300 is a significant
                                     chunk out of almost two billion.
                                     “No toxicologist, immunologist, or
                                     biochemist on the planet would tell
                                     you that we know that injecting a
                                     baby with 8 vaccines at once is safe
                                     based on the fact that we’ve done
                                     safety studies when using 3
                                     vaccines.”
                                     This obviously shows you did not
                                     bother reading the first study on the
                                     list, nor any of the others. Perhaps

                                     point me to a single safety study
                                     that looks at the effects of this
                                     combination?”

                                     even commented on one.”
                                     Chris, you seem like a nice person
                                     with genuinely positive motivations.
                                     But none of those studies looks at
                                     anything of the sort, and they don’t
                                     pretend to. Completely making things
                                     up is not an effective strategy for
                                     arguing that vaccines have been
                                     adequately safety tested. You might
                                     as well say that you believe vaccines
                                     are safe because the vaccine unicorn
                                     fairies told you so. You’re really
                                     not helping your cause.

                                     When I pointed out that the studies
                                     did not use unvaccinated controls, I
                                     was correctly identifying that they
                                     were not of an appropriate study
                                     design to answer the question I was
                                     asking.
                                     But while we’re on the subject, can
                                     you explain to me the relevance of
                                     the Belmont report for using
                                     unvaccinated controls in
                                     observational studies, which these
                                     all are? I’m failing to see the
                                     connection. Colin explained that the
                                     way the Belmont report is commonly
                                     interpreted, it’s considered
                                     unethical to randomise children to a
                                     group that would not receive
                                     vaccines. These studies are examining
                                     what happened in the past without
                                     affecting vaccination status, which
                                     was determined over a decade earlier
                                     in the case of the first study. Sorry
                                     for being dense at stats and
                                     epidemiology and what not, but I’d
                                     really appreciate it if you could
                                     explain it to me.
                                     Colin – The schedule at the time of
                                     the Smith study was – 2 hep B, 3 dtp,
                                     3 Hibs, and 2 polio. The current
                                     schedule adds to this 3 Rvs, 3 PCVs,
                                     2 IPVs and flu from 6 months. A study
                                     looking at the safety of the
                                     1993-1997 vaccine schedule, while not
                                     irrelevant, simply does not
                                     adequately assess the safety of the
                                     current vaccine schedule, which is
                                     much larger. I think it is a serious
                                     problem if this study is the one that
                                     comes closest to actually examining
                                     the safety of the current vaccine
                                     schedule.

                                     reason to think the schedule might be

                                     Errr, I did a couple of times, but
                                     you seem to keep ignoring it. Indeed,
                                     I actually wasn’t aware that there
                                     was any question about the
                                     plausibility of vaccines playing a
                                     significant role in immune

                                     simple way to summarise many of the

                                     of the inflammatory response that are
                                     intentionally stimulated by vaccines
                                     are consistent with the mechanisms

                                     mechanisms for induction of chronic

                                     you are, can we agree that
                                     researching the safety of the current
                                     vaccine schedule is a responsible and
                                     worthwhile endeavor?

                                     more about it than he.
                                     You’ve also been sold this idea that
                                     conventional medicine, while
                                     admittedly very dangerous, is the
                                     “good guy” because, though it has a
                                     very high rate of harm, it has good
                                     intentions and that “snake oil
                                     salesmen” are out to prey on the weak
                                     and take people’s money. This is pure
                                     fantasy. Both complementary and
                                     conventional medicine have ethical
                                     and unethical practitioners amongst
                                     their ranks and they all have
                                     financial interest in their
                                     treatments. You seem to be under the
                                     illusion, based on nothing factual at
                                     all, that off-label treatment is only
                                     done by dishonest people who are out
                                     to take advantage of the weak. Are
                                     you aware that due to the lack of
                                     financial incentives of
                                     pharmaceutical companies to do trials
                                     for pediatric interventions, 30 – 90%
                                     of treatment for children is off

                                     As for the law suit, we have an
                                     autistic child who by his father’s
                                     description is thriving, happy and
                                     doing much better than his diagnosis
                                     would predict. So why sue? 50,000
                                     bucks? A shot at full custody and an
                                     opportunity to get back at his ex
                                     with whom he was having a nasty
                                     divorce?
                                     And if these doctors are unethical
                                     “snake oil” salesmen, charging big
                                     bucks to torture kids, where are all
                                     the other angry parents? I mean,
                                     they’d have a very sympathetic ear
                                     with the media. Why not jump in? All
                                     I’ve seen is parents publicly coming
                                     to the defence of these doctors,
                                     saying that they were the only ones
                                     who helped their kids. The only
                                     outrage seems to be coming from
                                     “Quackwatch” and their readers.
                                     If the child had received chelation
                                     based on a diagnosis of autism, I
                                     would agree with you that this
                                     practice would be unethical. But the
                                     child received chelation following
                                     lab results that showed he had
                                     elevated levels of toxic metals in
                                     his system, including mercury. This
                                     is not a normal finding.
                                     I’d also like to point out that the
                                     most vocal person against the use of
                                     chelation, Dr Stephen Barrett, is
                                     himself the subject of a lawsuit. So
                                     by your illogical rationale, we
                                     really shouldn’t be listening to
                                     anything he says either. I’ve read
                                     through his article “How the “Urine
                                     Toxic Metals” Test Is Used to Defraud
                                     Patients” and the articles he
                                     references to support it, and he
                                     basically contradicts himself through
                                     out the entire article.
                                     The research literature as a whole
                                     indicates that some autistic children
                                     have high levels of heavy metals and
                                     others don’t, which is pretty much
                                     what you’d expect for a condition
                                     that experts believe is heterogenous
                                     in nature. The problem comes when one
                                     group of people set out to “prove”
                                     that mercury is THE cause of autism
                                     and then another group correctly
                                     points out that it isn’t. It’s
                                     probably a factor in some cases and
                                     not in others. I mean, giardia
                                     infection is accepted as a cause of
                                     GI upset. But half of people with
                                     confirmed infection don’t have
                                     symptoms. Does that mean we shouldn’t
                                     treat the infection in the
                                     symptomatic group? I mean, not
                                     everyone has symptoms so doesn’t that
                                     mean giardia infection isn’t the
                                     cause? No, that would be dumb.
                                     Autism is multi-factorial and
                                     heterogenous in nature – a
                                     significant number, though not all,
                                     have genetic defects effecting their
                                     ability to detoxify metals. These
                                     conclusions are coming from the
                                     mainstream research, not from the
                                     fringe. So seeing as this is the
                                     case, what’s your argument (based on
                                     no biomedical training at all) about
                                     the biological plausibility that some
                                     autistic kids are NOT effected by
                                     impaired detoxification of metals? It
                                     just simply doesn’t make any sense.

                                     “Meanwhile, as you’re fretting over
                                     the quality of serious medical
                                     research” – at least I used
                                     appropriate medical research to
                                     support my arguments. Let’s look at
                                     what Dr Raff’s post again: “They say
                                     that the aluminum in vaccines (an
                                     adjuvant, or component of the vaccine
                                     designed to enhance the body’s immune
                                     response) is harmful to children.
                                      But children consume more aluminum
                                     in natural breast milk than they do
                                     in vaccines, and far higher levels of
                                     aluminum are needed to cause harm.”
                                     First, what’s the relevance of the
                                     comparison to natural breast milk? Is
                                     it because breast milk is the most
                                     wholesome substance on God’s green
                                     earth and so we’re to understand that
                                     because vaccines have less aluminum
                                     they’re safe? Or is it that kids are
                                     getting so much aluminum from breast
                                     milk, that even though it’s an
                                     established toxic substance, the
                                     aluminum from vaccines is just a drop
                                     in the ocean?
                                     Neither of these interpretations are
                                     remotely supported in the scientific
                                     literature. Dr Raff either
                                     understands this, and was dishonest
                                     by repeating it, or uncritically
                                     repeated this piece of what can only
                                     be described as non-sensical,
                                     unscientific, pro-vaccine propaganda.
                                     We can skip over the study she cites
                                     about the aluminum content of the
                                     breastmilk of 42 Serbian mothers in
                                     1992 (the article actually states
                                     that these women have the highest
                                     average content ever reported in a
                                     study) because it’s beyond irrelevant
                                     to the safety of aluminum in
                                     vaccines.
                                     The other two references are to Dr
                                     Offit’s opinion pieces. His 2009
                                     opinion says about aluminum: “Sears’
                                     main argument for spacing out
                                     vaccines is to avoid giving infants
                                     too much aluminum at one time,
                                     writing, “When a baby gets the first
                                     big round of shots at two months, the
                                     total dose of aluminum can vary from
                                     295 micrograms . . . to a whopping
                                     1225 micrograms if the highest
                                     aluminum brands are used and a hep B

                                     severely premature infants to healthy
                                     newborns, Sears claims that these
                                     quantities might be unsafe. However,
                                     Sears fails to put aluminum exposure

                                     As Chris pointed out earlier, this is
                                     a referenced opinion piece based on
                                     “real science” so what’s the
                                     reference for this statement? Why,
                                     it’s Dr Offit’s 2003 opinion piece!
                                     Talk about opinion masturbation.
                                     Before we go to 2003, let’s talk
                                     about why comparing 116,000 ug of
                                     aluminum of orally consumed
                                     contaminated soy-based formula to
                                     1225 ug in each round of injected
                                     vaccines is dumb and dishonest. The
                                     scientific consensus will tell you
                                     that on average, people absorb about
                                     .03% of aluminum in orally ingested
                                     liquid while we absorb about 100% of
                                     aluminum when it’s injected (IM
                                     injections will absorb over time but
                                     the absorption is still about 100%).
                                     So if we correct the math for what
                                     toxicologists actually understand
                                     about drinking aluminum vs injecting
                                     it, we absorb about 348 ug of
                                     aluminum if we’re unlucky enough to
                                     be raised on contaminated soy-formula
                                     and 295 – 1225 ug of aluminum per
                                     round of vaccines. Don’t tell me that
                                     Dr Offit, America’s number one
                                     authority on vaccines, was confused
                                     on this point when he wrote his
                                     opinion. This is total garbage.
                                     Dr Offit continues: “Furthermore,
                                     Sears fails to describe scientific
                                     studies that led the National Vaccine
                                     Program Office to conclude that the
                                     amount of aluminum contained in
                                     vaccines did not warrant changing the
                                     vaccine schedule.17
                                     Well this is exciting, because I
                                     couldn’t find any scientific studies
                                     on this subject. So which studies is
                                     he referring to? Why, this reference
                                     is to a summary of a workshop held to
                                     discuss vaccine safety, not a
                                     reference to even one scientific
                                     study. And the transcript of this
                                     workshop indicates that even the
                                     makers of the vaccine schedule policy
                                     have no idea how the safe level of
                                     injectable aluminum was determined.
                                     But back to Offit supporting his
                                     opinion with his own opinion. What
                                     does Offit opine about the safety of
                                     aluminum in vaccines in 2003? First
                                     he writes “The safety of aluminum has
                                     been established by experience during
                                     the past 70 years, with hundreds of
                                     millions of people inoculated with
                                     aluminum-containing vaccines.” This
                                     pretty much echoes the consensus: we
                                     think it’s safe because we’ve been
                                     doing it a long time to a lot of
                                     people and there hasn’t seemed to be
                                     a problem. No long-term safety
                                     studies have been performed.
                                     Dr Raff, you’ve been awfully quiet,
                                     which I totally respect, but do you
                                     mind explaining to Colin why “it
                                     doesn’t seem to be a problem” is not
                                     a valid scientific method to
                                     determine the safety of injecting a
                                     toxic substance, especially one that
                                     it has been shown to accumulate in
                                     the brain over time because it cannot
                                     detoxify it? He seems to prefer
                                     hearing about scientific methods from
                                     pro-vax PhD’s.
                                     Dr Offit goes on to compare aluminum
                                     in vaccines to aluminum in breast
                                     milk and formulas, citing the Serbian
                                     milk study and 3 studies showing how
                                     formula contaminated with aluminum at
                                     the levels Dr Offit was implying were
                                     safe were actually making infants
                                     sick.
                                     The one study he references that
                                     looks at aluminum levels in vaccines
                                     for infants, “Aluminum toxicokinetics
                                     regarding infant diet and
                                     vaccinations”, clearly states that
                                     “the body burden of aluminum from
                                     vaccination exceeds that from dietary
                                     sources” (so Dr Offit surely was
                                     aware that his comparison 116,600 ug
                                     of aluminum in soy formula was total
                                     BS). This study, which somehow
                                     manages to come down on the side of
                                     the aluminum content in vaccines
                                     being sufficiently low, finds that
                                     aluminum levels actually rise above
                                     the safe level following vaccination,
                                     just not a lot and not for very long.
                                     It also points out that the mechanism
                                     by which aluminum exerts its toxic
                                     effects is not understood, so there’s
                                     really no one in a position to say
                                     whether or not this is a problem.
                                     Dr Offit continues: “For determining
                                     the quantity of aluminum below which
                                     safety is likely, data were generated
                                     in mice that were inoculated orally
                                     with various quantities of aluminum
                                     lactate.42 No adverse reactions were
                                     observed when mice were fed
                                     quantities of aluminum as high as 62
                                     mg/kg/day. By applying uncertainty
                                     factors of 3 (for extrapolation to
                                     humans) and 10 (for human
                                     variability), the ATSDR concluded
                                     that the minimum risk level for
                                     exposure to aluminum was 2
                                     mg/kg/day.43”
                                     Ah, orally administered aluminum in
                                     mice X 3 X 10. Where did 3 and 10
                                     come? Ah, who cares. Sounds robust .
                                     . . So all of the safety studies have
                                     been done on animals, which is widely
                                     recognised to not be an adequate
                                     proxy for humans. Chris, tell me
                                     about this Belmont report again.
                                     Could we do a study where we
                                     randomised infants to get injected
                                     placebo or the amount of aluminum
                                     normally injected into them when they
                                     go for a round of vaccines and see
                                     what happens? I mean, you can’t use
                                     my infant, or even you guys could
                                     volunteer for such a study, as
                                     confident as you are in the
                                     established safety of toxin for which
                                     it’s toxic and adjuvant mechanisms
                                     are poorly understood and no long
                                     term safety studies have been done?
                                     Sound like a plan?
                                   o Chris August 4, 2014 at 9:40 am
                                     Have not read this last reply, but
                                     noticed this: “Chris, tell me about
                                     this Belmont report again.”
                                     Obviously you are having trouble with
                                     the “search thingy”: The Belmont
                                     Report.
                                     “But while we’re on the subject, can
                                     you explain to me the relevance of
                                     the Belmont report for using
                                     unvaccinated controls in
                                     observational studies, which these
                                     all are? I’m failing to see the
                                     connection.”
                                     If you are not going to insist that
                                     the controls be randomly blinded,
                                     then that is a straight
                                     epidemiological study like many
                                     listed in Vaccine Safety: Examine the
                                     Evidence. But if you want what is
                                     commonly called out for by the
                                     anti-vax groups for a randomly
                                     controlled blinded study, then you
                                     have a problem:
                                     The “One Study,” or why the
                                     anti-vaccine movement doesn’t really
                                     understand science.

                                     If you are still unsatisfied with any
                                     of the studies linked to above, then
                                     do it yourself. Design a study that
                                     would satisfy your obviously well
                                     thought out criteria, make sure it
                                     conforms to the human safety
                                     requirements of the Belmont Report,
                                     get it approved by an IRB
                                     (Independent Review Board), then
                                     write a grant for funding. You can
                                     then submit that grant to SafeMinds
                                     or Autism Speaks (which are both
                                     funding studies), and even to your
                                     own NHS. Then go do it.

                                     “Completely making things up is not
                                     an effective strategy for arguing
                                     that vaccines have been adequately
                                     safety tested.”
                                     I have not done that. You complained
                                     that the matched case control study
                                     on vaccine exposure for the first two
                                     years did not compare vaccinated to
                                     unvaccinated children (the case
                                     control study that says: “256
                                     children with autism spectrum
                                     disorder (ASD) and 752 control
                                     children matched on birth year, sex,
                                     and MCO”). It shows you did not
                                     understand it, and are really
                                     insisting on a study that violates
                                     the human study ethics outlined in
                                     the Belmont Report. I can’t help it
                                     if you do not understand ethics, case
                                     controls, and statistics in medical
                                     studies.

                                     “But the child received chelation
                                     following lab results that showed he
                                     had elevated levels of toxic metals
                                     in his system, including mercury.
                                     This is not a normal finding.”
                                     The outrage came from lots of people,
                                     which you would have known if you
                                     clicked on the link I provided.
                                     Unfortunately lots of webpages have
                                     disappeared in the last ten years,
                                     but one upshot was that Kerry was
                                     directed to chelate the child by Dr.
                                     Anju Usman (who is also named in the
                                     lawsuit linked to by Colin). She
                                     would use the Doctor’s Data lab,
                                     which has a dubious reputation,
                                     especially since it uses provoked
                                     urine tests. I did find this summary:

                                     There were many stories by the
                                     chelation apologists that appeared
                                     after the execution. One of them was
                                     that it was the wrong chelator (legal
                                     records show it was the only one
                                     Kerry used), and that the child had
                                     tested positive for lead poisoning,
                                     not just “aluminum” (which is not a
                                     heavy metal).
                                     But the question I asked several
                                     times years ago has never been
                                     answered: if the child, a UK citizen,
                                     actually had lead poisoning, why
                                     wasn’t he treated for that very real
                                     condition by the NHS in the UK? Why
                                     did his mother drag him across the
                                     Atlantic to be treated by an
                                     ear/nose/throat doctor with
                                     chelation?

                                     Oh, and I have another question: How
                                     can folks claim that any ingredient
                                     in a vaccine causes neurological
                                     damage or autism when there is no
                                     real data that shows a correlation?
                                     Why blame aluminum or whatever in a
                                     vaccine, when there is really no good
                                     evidence the vaccine causes the harm
                                     claimed?
                                     And here is another study, it does
                                     compare vaxed with unvaxed kids:
                                     Vaccination Status and Health in
                                     Children and Adolescents. The only
                                     difference between the two sets of
                                     children is those who are not
                                     vaccinated are more likely to get
                                     vaccine preventable diseases.
                                   o Colin August 4, 2014 at 11:52 pm
                                     Colin – The schedule at the time of
                                     the Smith study was – 2 hep B, 3 dtp,
                                     3 Hibs, and 2 polio. The current
                                     schedule adds to this 3 Rvs, 3 PCVs,
                                     2 IPVs and flu from 6 months. A study
                                     looking at the safety of the
                                     1993-1997 vaccine schedule, while not
                                     irrelevant, simply does not
                                     adequately assess the safety of the
                                     current vaccine schedule, which is
                                     much larger. I think it is a serious
                                     problem if this study is the one that
                                     comes closest to actually examining
                                     the safety of the current vaccine
                                     schedule.
                                     Yes, the schedule changes from time
                                     to time. It’s not feasible, even if
                                     it were ethical, to randomly deny
                                     some children access to those
                                     vaccines to rerun a study on the
                                     entire schedule every time. Thus,
                                     researchers look for any evidence of
                                     harm that suggests the studies that
                                     can be done are inadequate, and for
                                     other ways (such as epidemiological
                                     studies) to analyze the safety of the
                                     schedule. There is no good evidence
                                     that the schedule is harmful beyond
                                     the known and acknowledged adverse
                                     events, nor has the alt-med community
                                     been able to gin any up.
                                     Nevertheless, you will keep demanding
                                     that impossible studies be done
                                     rather than coming to terms with the
                                     evidence that vaccines are safe and
                                     effective. As a rhetorical tactic it
                                     insulates you from inconvenient
                                     evidence, but it also keeps you from
                                     arriving at what is the
                                     overwhelmingly likely correct
                                     conclusion about vaccine safety.
                                     Indeed, I actually wasn’t aware that
                                     there was any question about the
                                     plausibility of vaccines playing a
                                     significant role in immune
                                     dysfunction and chronic inflammation
                                     (a biological mechanism that
                                     underlies nearly all chronic
                                     illness).
                                     Aren’t you assuming that autism is
                                     caused by “immune dysfunction and
                                     chronic inflammation”, that vaccines
                                     cause those things beyond the
                                     recognized adverse events, and that
                                     they cause those things in autistic
                                     kids? I ask because you seem to be
                                     waving your hands so quickly I’m
                                     concerned you might reach escape
                                     velocity. Citing evidence that
                                     vaccines cause an “inflammatory
                                     response” is an enormous distance
                                     away from proposing a plausible
                                     mechanism as to how they cause
                                     autism. No one seems to be able to do
                                     that, going (at least) as far back as
                                     Wakefield.
                                     When I say “plausibility,” I mean
                                     whether there is actually a
                                     biologically plausible mechanism by
                                     which vaccines could cause the
                                     various ills ascribed to them by the
                                     alt-med community, like autism and
                                     SIDS. Of course, like you I’m neither
                                     a doctor nor particularly well
                                     trained in biochemistry. I can’t
                                     really judge biological plausibility
                                     for myself. If you have an actual
                                     theory to advance, I’d appreciate a
                                     reference to someone qualified to
                                     assess it as well.
                                     I don’t need a biologically plausible
                                     mechanism by which vaccines could
                                     cause autism to support research into
                                     the safety of vaccines. Fortunately
                                     that research has been done, and
                                     found no causal connection or
                                     significant correlation between
                                     vaccines and autism. Nevertheless,
                                     you’re “just asking questions” as if
                                     those answers didn’t exist.
                                     I’m also happy to have more research
                                     done on the safety of vaccines–and
                                     once again, it’s being done. Not by
                                     accupuncturists “just asking
                                     questions,” of course, but by real
                                     doctors and PhDs who are asking
                                     questions in order to learn more
                                     about the problem, rather than as a
                                     rhetorical tactic. (I think it’s
                                     beyond dispute by now that your
                                     questions are rhetorical; you began
                                     this conversation, after all, by
                                     relying on shady anti-vax research
                                     that you later admitted you hadn’t
                                     even read. If you’re just asking
                                     questions in order to find out
                                     answers, you’re doing a very bad job
                                     of it.)
                                     Obviously I haven’t read each of
                                     these studies, and no one should take
                                     my word on the state of the evidence.
                                     I’m persuaded that the evidence
                                     favors the safety of vaccines–by an
                                     overwhelming margin–party because I
                                     have yet to see complaints by
                                     anti-vaxers that stand up to
                                     scrutiny, and partly because the
                                     experts who are qualified to assess
                                     the evidence virtually uniformly
                                     conclude that vaccines are safe and
                                     effective. In other words, the
                                     community of epidemiologists reviews
                                     the status of the research and
                                     generates careful, balanced reports
                                     concluding there is no particular
                                     cause to be concerned about the
                                     safety of vaccines and that the
                                     evidence favors rejecting the
                                     vaccine-autism hypothesis. The
                                     alt-med community gets on blogs and
                                     screams about how vaccines are
                                     poison, while chelation is a safe and
                                     effective antidote. One of these
                                     positions is much more likely to
                                     understand the complex empirical
                                     evidence than the other.
                                     Your argument that this review should
                                     somehow not be used as a reference in
                                     a blog post to support the argument
                                     that the statement “there’s no
                                     evidence for the effectiveness of
                                     chelation” is incorrect seems to be
                                     based on irrational emotion and
                                     nothing logical at all.
                                     You are taking refuge in an absurdly
                                     hyperliteral reading of “there’s no
                                     evidence for the effectiveness of
                                     chelation.” As I said earlier, I
                                     doubt you’d bat an eye if someone
                                     said there was no evidence for
                                     Bigfoot–even though a veterinarian
                                     claims to have sequenced its genome.
                                     You apply different criteria in order
                                     to justify your red-eyed claim that
                                     Dr. Raff was lying.
                                     Minority positions generate their own
                                     evidence. If a community believes
                                     something, particularly when their
                                     belief runs counter to the mainstream
                                     position, it will create its own
                                     evidentiary support–papers, theses,
                                     blogs, whatever it takes to persuade
                                     people on the margins. When somone
                                     says “there’s no evidence for X,”
                                     they virtually never mean, “no one
                                     has ever even claimed that X is
                                     true.” And that’s what they’d have to
                                     mean, for the statement to be
                                     literally true, since just the fact
                                     that someone says that X is true is
                                     technically evidence for X. The rest
                                     of us have no trouble understanding
                                     the statement–and I suspect you
                                     wouldn’t either, except that you were
                                     hot to call Dr. Raff a liar.
                                     No, I’m not qualified to conclude ab
                                     initio that chelation is ineffective
                                     and unsafe as a treatment for autism.
                                     I rely on the experts to conclude
                                     that–which they have. Just look at
                                     the evidence you had to dredge up to
                                     defend it: a doctor marketing
                                     chelation therapy who is operating so
                                     far on the fringes that he allegedly
                                     diagnoses children over the phone and
                                     uses chelating agents prior to a
                                     urine test to create the appearance
                                     of heavy metals in the urine.
                                     Now you want to defend the paper.
                                     Earlier you were claiming you hadn’t
                                     bothered to think critically about
                                     it. I think the fact that you relied
                                     on it, in particular to support your
                                     frothing, bilious screed against Dr.
                                     Raff’s accurate assessment of the
                                     state of the evidence. I think the
                                     fact that you posted it without
                                     bothering to think about it says
                                     quite a lot about your methodology:
                                     attack first, think later. Never
                                     admit error.
                                     Your current defense of chelation is
                                     highly misleading. You say the paper
                                     has been cited 108 times, but for
                                     what? It’s a paper assessing many
                                     different “treatments” for
                                     autism–chelation, the thing you
                                     relied on it to support, is just one.
                                     You’re using all the citations to the
                                     overall paper to defend the
                                     reasonableness of chelation as an
                                     autism treatment, but I suspect only
                                     a tiny portion of those citations
                                     dealt with chelation.
                                     And of course, even a scientist who
                                     is making money directly off of
                                     chelation couldn’t find good support
                                     for it. That paper grades autism
                                     “treatments” based on the supporting
                                     evidence, and it gives chelation a
                                     “C” – in other words, all they could
                                     find to support it is at least one
                                     “level 2b or 3b study, or two level 4
                                     studies.” (Level 2b studies are
                                     “individual cohort (prospective,
                                     nonrandomized)” studies; level 3b are
                                     “individual case-control
                                     (retrospective) studies”. Level 4
                                     studies are “case series or
                                     reports.”)) The author relies on
                                     uncontrolled unrandomized studies of
                                     self-reported results.
                                     In other words, the evidence for the
                                     safety and efficacy of chelation is
                                     vastly worse than the evidence for
                                     the safety and efficacy of vaccines.
                                     But you’re “just asking questions”
                                     about vaccines, and angrily defending
                                     chelation. Is that because chelation
                                     treatment lives in the same alt-med
                                     community you do?
                                     I haven’t found any criticism of the
                                     review on the web, try as I may, so
                                     I’m not sure what you’re on about.
                                     I don’t think you looked very
                                     carefully. I suspect you were
                                     disincintivized to do so, or perhaps
                                     are not as well-trained a researcher
                                     as you’ve suggested. (Your admitted
                                     unfamiliarity with the standards for
                                     controlled human studies makes me
                                     suspect both are true.)
                                     First, it’s a review article. If you
                                     want to know whether it’s
                                     high-quality, look at what it’s
                                     reviewing. In this case, the author
                                     approvingly cites, inter alia,
                                     several studies by Mark and David
                                     Geier. That would be Mark Geier,
                                     whose “medical license has been
                                     suspended or revoked in every state
                                     in which he was licensed,” and his
                                     son David, who was found guilty of
                                     practicing medicine without a
                                     license. There is plenty of criticism
                                     of their research out there… but not
                                     in Rossignol’s review, or your
                                     approving citation thereof.
                                     As I said, the minority in a
                                     scientific dispute will generate
                                     evidence to support its position over
                                     time. Sometimes the minority is
                                     right, in which case that evidence
                                     will be persuasive and meaningful.
                                     Sometimes the minority is wrong, in
                                     which case the evidence will be
                                     self-serving and hollow. Which better
                                     describes the work of the Geiers, a
                                     review article that lavishes
                                     attention on it, and your blithely
                                     uncritical reliance on that review?
                                     You’ve also been sold this idea that
                                     conventional medicine, while
                                     admittedly very dangerous, is the
                                     “good guy” because, though it has a
                                     very high rate of harm, it has good
                                     intentions and that “snake oil
                                     salesmen” are out to prey on the weak
                                     and take people’s money.
                                     Not at all. I think that scientific
                                     medicine is “the good guy” because it
                                     tests its interventions, rigorously,
                                     and attempts only to do what helps
                                     while going to sometimes absurd
                                     lengths to avoid doing harm. It can’t
                                     completely avoid that harm, but it
                                     works to minimize it. I don’t see the
                                     same efforts on the part of
                                     acupuncturists and homeopaths and
                                     reiki masters. For the most part I
                                     don’t think those people are trying
                                     to harm their patients–I think they
                                     genuinely want to help their
                                     customers. But scientific rigor is
                                     hard, and expensive. I think that in
                                     lieu of that, alt-med practitioners
                                     convince themselves that they’re
                                     helping through a convenient mix of
                                     confirmation bias, ignoring the
                                     regression to the mean, and other
                                     forms of irrationality. And since
                                     they’re selling placebos, they
                                     typically do fairly little harm if
                                     also doing fairly little good.
                                     The real horror stories are when
                                     someone is persuaded to avoide
                                     legitimate, science-based medicine in
                                     favor of woo, which appears to be the
                                     point of your scaremongering hit
                                     piece about how vaccines are
                                     dangerous.
                                     And if these doctors are unethical
                                     “snake oil” salesmen, charging big
                                     bucks to torture kids, where are all
                                     the other angry parents? I mean,
                                     they’d have a very sympathetic ear
                                     with the media.
                                     We–and I include you–can only
                                     speculate. Having spent the last two
                                     years studying irrationality, I
                                     suspect the answer lies largely with
                                     confirmation bias. Most parents’ kids
                                     aren’t hurt by woo, so they convince
                                     themselves it either helped or at
                                     least didn’t hurt. Believing
                                     otherwise would entail believing that
                                     they rejected their doctors’ advice
                                     and put their children in harm’s way,
                                     which would be a painful and
                                     difficult realization. So most such
                                     parents, being human beings, find a
                                     way to believe otherwise–that their
                                     magical cure worked. The fact that
                                     the empirical data don’t support that
                                     conclusion is not difficult for a
                                     motivated person to ignore, as you
                                     kindly demonstrate.
                                     Overall, most alt-med treatments are
                                     placebos. Most placebos don’t hurt.
                                     As long as kids are also getting
                                     decent medical care, parents will
                                     have a hard time distinguishing
                                     between the results. They’ll see
                                     their kids getting better and thank
                                     the nutritional supplements instead
                                     of (or in addition to) the behavioral
                                     therapist. The harm that’s done, in
                                     terms of wasted time, money, and
                                     energy, is diffuse enough that most
                                     parents won’t get activated to fight
                                     back.
                                     Why not jump in? All I’ve seen is
                                     parents publicly coming to the
                                     defence of these doctors, saying that
                                     they were the only ones who helped
                                     their kids.
                                     Well that’s not true. You’ve seen the
                                     lawsuit we’ve been discussing, and if
                                     you searched you’d find others. Not
                                     as many as I’d like, I think due to
                                     the difficulty of proving even
                                     medical malpractice cases where there
                                     are clear standards of care that
                                     don’t exist in the alt-med world.
                                     There is little incentive to attack
                                     an alt-med provider, though; as I
                                     said, it would be psychologically
                                     difficult, expensive, and unlikely to
                                     succeed in the long run. Not to
                                     mention bloggers like yourself jump
                                     to attack such people. Your reaction
                                     to the lawsuit in question was to
                                     sneeringly insinuate that it was just
                                     a divorce tactic. Stay classy, Mel.
                                     If the child had received chelation
                                     based on a diagnosis of autism, I
                                     would agree with you that this
                                     practice would be unethical. But the
                                     child received chelation following
                                     lab results that showed he had
                                     elevated levels of toxic metals in
                                     his system, including mercury. This
                                     is not a normal finding.
                                     Read the article again; you will
                                     notice that the allegation is that
                                     the child was given chelating agents
                                     first, after
                                     which–unsurprisingly–heavy metals
                                     showed up in his urine. I’ve read
                                     that allegation elsewhere, as well. I
                                     think it’s probably a pretty common
                                     tactic for doctors selling chelation
                                     who need to persuade potential
                                     customers that they have heavy-metal
                                     poisoning. It’s like a chimneysweep
                                     dumping a bag of coal dust down the
                                     mark’s chimney before knocking on
                                     their door, suggesting an expensive
                                     cleaning.
                                     I’d also like to point out that the
                                     most vocal person against the use of
                                     chelation, Dr Stephen Barrett, is
                                     himself the subject of a lawsuit. So
                                     by your illogical rationale, we
                                     really shouldn’t be listening to
                                     anything he says either.
                                     You have not understood my rationale.
                                     I’m a trained litigator; I have no
                                     problem with someone who is “the
                                     subject of a lawsuit,” many of whom
                                     have been or will eventually be my
                                     clients and friends. You’ve got to
                                     dig deeper than that.
                                     [Mercury is] probably a factor in
                                     some cases and not in others.
                                     “Probably”! How probably? 50% likely?
                                     60%? 99%? Space aliens are probably
                                     responsible for most missing persons
                                     cases. Meteor strikes are probably
                                     responsible for most unexplained
                                     fires. Cosmic rays are probably
                                     responsible for most of my supposed
                                     typos. The lovely thing about
                                     make-believe medicine is that you
                                     don’t need data to support
                                     hand-waving like that. You can just
                                     throw it out there and complain about
                                     the evil pharma companies if (and
                                     when) you have trouble finding
                                     empirical data to support your
                                     just-so stories.
                                     An interesting point about
                                     chelation–even if mercury caused
                                     autism (a conclusion that virtually
                                     no reputable specialists share, and
                                     which the medical community overall
                                     has found to be contrary to the
                                     evidence) chelation wouldn’t fix it.
                                     Use your “search thingy” to look up
                                     the results of studies on chelation
                                     for children suffering from
                                     legitimate heavy metal toxicity.
                                     Removing the metals didn’t repair
                                     their neurological injuries. They
                                     didn’t show significant improvements.
                                     First, what’s the relevance of the
                                     comparison to natural breast milk?
                                     I don’t know, I didn’t write it.
                                     Probably because that’s what the
                                     literature was testing. I suspect the
                                     rhetorical point is that there’s not
                                     much point in fretting over the
                                     aluminum in vaccines when even the
                                     crunchiest of parents feed their kids
                                     relatively large amounts of aluminum
                                     regularly. This illustrates how
                                     little empirical foundation there is
                                     for aluminum fears. It also points
                                     out something that many anti-vaxers
                                     don’t understand, which is that
                                     “toxic” substances exist all around
                                     us and inside us. The dose determines
                                     the poison; drinking formaldehyde is
                                     rather unhealthy, but apples are good
                                     for you. That sort of thing. It’s a
                                     rather loose rhetorical point.
                                     I think the better argument is simply
                                     to point out that there doesn’t seem
                                     to be any good evidence that aluminum
                                     causes autism or that autistic kids
                                     (or a discrete subset thereof) have
                                     unsafe levels of aluminum. It’s just
                                     more hand waving, supported by yet
                                     more terrible research (such as the
                                     Tomljenovic paper “plotting ASD
                                     incidence in each year (1991-2008)
                                     against total aluminium content for
                                     the pediatric schedule in that
                                     year“).
                                     The one study he references that
                                     looks at aluminum levels in vaccines
                                     for infants, “Aluminum toxicokinetics
                                     regarding infant diet and
                                     vaccinations”, clearly states that
                                     “the body burden of aluminum from
                                     vaccination exceeds that from dietary
                                     sources” (so Dr Offit surely was
                                     aware that his comparison 116,600 ug
                                     of aluminum in soy formula was total
                                     BS). This study, which somehow
                                     manages to come down on the side of
                                     the aluminum content in vaccines
                                     being sufficiently low, finds that
                                     aluminum levels actually rise above
                                     the safe level following vaccination,
                                     just not a lot and not for very long.
                                     Thanks for citing this. I was under
                                     the impression that there were no
                                     findings of elevated aluminum levels
                                     post-vaccination, so I appreciate the
                                     information. I find it interesting
                                     that even this paper concludes that
                                     aluminum levels of the first year of
                                     a child’s life, assuming they get all
                                     the recommended vaccines, remains
                                     below the minimal risk level.
                                     Chris, tell me about this Belmont
                                     report again. Could we do a study
                                     where we randomised infants to get
                                     injected placebo or the amount of
                                     aluminum normally injected into them
                                     when they go for a round of vaccines
                                     and see what happens? I mean, you
                                     can’t use my infant, or even you guys
                                     could volunteer for such a study, as
                                     confident as you are in the
                                     established safety of toxin for which
                                     it’s toxic and adjuvant mechanisms
                                     are poorly understood and no long
                                     term safety studies have been done?
                                     Sound like a plan?
                                     I’m not Chris, but it sounds like
                                     you’re asking parents to have their
                                     kids injected with “the amount of
                                     aluminum normally injected into them
                                     when they go for a round of
                                     vaccines.” Mel, I think you’re going
                                     to feel silly when I point this out,
                                     but they do that. It’s called “going
                                     for a round of vaccines.” Do you
                                     understand? When parents get their
                                     kids vaccinated, as over 90% do,
                                     their kids get “the amount of
                                     aluminum normally injected into them
                                     when they go for a round of vaccines”
                                     as part of those shots. And guess
                                     what? The results have been studied.
                                     Vaccines don’t cause autism, even
                                     with the aluminum.

                                     Okay, I am biased in really focusing
                                     on the bits of the long tracks that
                                     are addressed to me, but I am amused
                                     to see that she applies lots of
                                     vitriol and insults to my comments
                                     even after you say:
                                     “I’m also happy to have more research
                                     done on the safety of vaccines–and
                                     once again, it’s being done. Not by

                                     doctors and PhDs who are asking
                                     questions in order to learn more
                                     about the problem, rather than as a

                                     Awesome.
                                     “I think the fact that you posted it
                                     without bothering to think about it

                                     later. Never admit error.”
                                     Again, awesome. She has blamed me for
                                     committing many errors, but has not
                                     explained what they are.

                                     procedure. She is not satisfied by
                                     the several epidemiological and
                                     matched case studies, so she need to
                                     design her own study that does not
                                     violate the Belmont Report. Or at
                                     least explain clearly why the ones

                                     lame and quite inadequate criticism.

                                     Ah, very true. I used those studies
                                     trying to tell the “Mercury Militia”
                                     moms advocating chelation that it was

                                     that email listserv was that one of
                                     those was an employee of a doctor who

                                     vaccine, an objective observer would
                                     have to emulate Lewis Carroll’s White
                                     Queen and be able to believe six
                                     impossible (or, at least, highly
                                     improbable) things before breakfast.
                                     The families of children with ASD and
                                     the court have waited in vain for
                                     adequate evidence to support the
                                     autism-MMR hypothesis. Although I
                                     have the deepest sympathy for
                                     families like Colten’s, struggling
                                     emotionally and financially to find
                                     answers about ASD’s causes, and
                                     reliable therapies to treat ASD’s
                                     symptoms, I must decide Colten’s case
                                     based on the evidence before me
                                     “The results have been studied.
                                     Vaccines don’t cause autism, even
                                     with the aluminum.”
                                     Um, yeah. You can’t really pinpoint
                                     that a particular ingredient causes
                                     harm, when the actual end product
                                     really does not show harm, especially
                                     when compared to the disease it is
                                     supposed to prevent!
                                     “We–and I include you–can only
                                     speculate. Having spent the last two
                                     years studying irrationality.”
                                     I have spent more than twenty years
                                     dealing with irrationality. From
                                     explaining that the kid’s seizures
                                     just happened, that his lack of
                                     speech was not from the lack of me
                                     speaking to him (in two languages!),
                                     or that just because he communicated
                                     in sign language does not mean he is
                                     deaf or stupid. Le sigh. And his last
                                     seizures were from an actual disease,
                                     so it was not a vaccine!

                                     Chris and Colin, I wonder if you will
                                     ever understand that you will never
                                     convert the anti-vax crowd to your
                                     viewpoint for the simple reason that
                                     they do not respect your sources –
                                     about the history and science of
                                     vaccine safety, effectiveness,
                                     licensing, monitoring, etc.
                                     To many who have witnessed breaches
                                     of trust by institutions involved
                                     with public health initiatives and
                                     the development, licensing, and
                                     monitoring of vaccines, your faith
                                     seems like the first and most
                                     compelling evidence of insanity or
                                     complicity. For those aware of
                                     scandals in the pharmaceutical
                                     industry, or who have witnessed
                                     injury or mortality as a result of
                                     treatments and/or drugs employed by
                                     Western medicine, it is a case of,
                                     “Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me
                                     twice, shame on me.” For such
                                     persons, the tone of your responses
                                     comes across as arrogant and blind to
                                     the imperfections and corruption that
                                     exist in your preferred paradigm.
                                     For a fact, I don’t see either of you
                                     acknowledging reasons for caution
                                     when asserting that everyone should
                                     trust the dominant medical
                                     establishment as much as you do, and
                                     it is precisely when you pretend –
                                     with arrogance dripping from every
                                     word – that there are no chinks in
                                     the rationale for your position
                                     (while simultaneously disregarding
                                     any possibility of effective
                                     treatments that might from
                                     alternative medicine) that you lose
                                     all hope of being respected by those
                                     in the opposite camp. And by the way,
                                     the ad hominem attacks earn negative
                                     points every time.
                                     Just thought you might like to know
                                     what is really at the heart of the
                                     disconnect.

                                     We have a term for alternative

                                     For real scandals, and if you
                                     actually have an open mind, read:

                                     Also “Western medicine”, at what

                                     medicine go from “Western” to

                                     of the Pacific Ocean, then you should

                                     I think that your logic doesn’t make
                                     much sense. It is like saying that
                                     baseball is forever corrupt because
                                     the 1919 world series was rigged.
                                     There are bad apples and evil doers
                                     in every industry, including and
                                     likely even more so in alternative
                                     medicine since there is much less
                                     rigor involved in understanding what
                                     is going on. The main point is if you
                                     can understand the science, read it
                                     and make an informed decision. If you
                                     don’t understand it, you should rely
                                     on people that do vs believing the
                                     massive amount of debunked
                                     misinformation.

                                     I don’t believe that you have
                                     accurately identified “what is really
                                     at the heart of the disconnect.” No
                                     one pretends that the pharmaceutical
                                     industry is blameless in all things,
                                     or has never done wrong or harmed a
                                     patient. This is an example of a
                                     strawman argument: a false position
                                     ascribed to the other side of a
                                     debate in order to justify
                                     disregarding their actual position.
                                     The actual heart of the disconnect
                                     is, in my opinion, the irrational
                                     conclusion of anti-vaxers that
                                     vaccines are more harmful than the
                                     evidence suggests. In lieu of actual
                                     evidence to support this position,
                                     the anti-vax movement has relied on
                                     scare stories and conspiracy theories
                                     to support their preconceptions.
                                     For example, you say that you have
                                     “witnessed breaches of trust by
                                     institutions involved with public
                                     health initiatives.” To be blunt, so
                                     what? Human institutions are
                                     imperfect. The question is whether
                                     there is evidence that the
                                     accusations made by Wakefield et al
                                     are actually true; there is not.
                                     Pointing to other failures of related
                                     actors is not evidence of the alleged
                                     harm in this case. It may feel like
                                     evidence, though, which is enough for
                                     someone merely looking to justify a
                                     preconception.

                                     Hence my suggestion to read a history
                                     of the FDA. It is made up of human
                                     beings, and has had its ups and
                                     downs. Though one of the most blatant
                                     breaches by an pharmaceutical company
                                     was one that tried to convince Dr.
                                     Kelsey’s supervisors to ignore her
                                     requests for more data on the effect
                                     of thalidomide on fetal development
                                     (prior to working at the FDA she had
                                     studied birth defects in rabbits due
                                     to certain drug inputs).

                                     Oh, I just read your linked blog
                                     piece about a “middle way.” The one
                                     in which you claim a “professor and
                                     researcher in the fields of vaccine
                                     and therapeutic pharmaceutical
                                     development” told you there were no
                                     adjuvants in Canadian vaccines, cite
                                     Age of Autism for interpretation of
                                     scientific studies, and suggest that
                                     the “elephant in the room” is that
                                     vaccines are unnecessary because we
                                     have clean water and nutritious food
                                     now.
                                     Looking to you for guidance on a
                                     “middle way” for public health seems
                                     rather like asking the man reeking of
                                     kerosene, with matches clenched in
                                     his teeth, whether we should turn up
                                     the thermostat or light a fire.
                                     You’ll have fun, but the rest of us
                                     get burned.

                                     Don’t forget that the oral polio
                                     vaccine was responsible for the HIV
                                     epidemic in the same blog piece. The
                                     issue is not that those of us who
                                     support vaccination don’t understand
                                     the disconnect, we do. We just
                                     believe in our hearts that the
                                     science that is so convincing to
                                     almost everyone will also convince
                                     you. It is clear that it is a bridge
                                     that is often impossible to cross for
                                     anti-vaxxers. Most rational people
                                     will look at all of the data in the
                                     literature over the course of decades
                                     and reason that the overwhelming
                                     conclusion to be drawn is that
                                     vaccines are almost completely safe
                                     and provide one of the greatest risk
                                     benefit ratios known to humans
                                     throughout the history of medicine.
                                     Only antibiotics might rival this.
                                     What we also have a hard time
                                     wrapping our heads around is that
                                     anti-vaxxers fundamentally don’t
                                     believe in the hard science that
                                     supports vaccination For those of us
                                     who are actually scientists, this
                                     disconnect is especially difficult to
                                     understand. It makes us feel that we
                                     have somehow failed in science
                                     education somewhere along the way. If
                                     you can’t believe that the science
                                     isn’t real then there really is no
                                     hope. I think mostly that what Chris
                                     and Colin are doing is catching those
                                     folks who might be on the fence and
                                     not the true anti-believers like
                                     magellan35.
                                     It is also clear from your
                                     fundamental misunderstanding of the
                                     immunology not only of vaccines, but
                                     of infectious disease as a whole,
                                     that you are operating from a pretty
                                     dishonest place to start. I’d maybe
                                     recommend an immunology class at your
                                     local community college. Although
                                     I’ll warn you, most of what you will
                                     learn there was published in the same
                                     peer reviewed journals that you
                                     purport not to believe so who knows
                                     what you will get out of it.

                           Coin, great answer. I’m interested in your
                           research. Can you recommend any good reading on
                           combatting the conspiracy theorist (CT)
                           mentality? I think I am science-literate, and I
                           enjoy discussing/debating the same. But I get
                           so thrown by the CTs, I think b/c we have no
                           shared language (truths, acceptance of basics,
                           etc.), and so I can’t communicate with them.
                           While I can recognize they’re wrong or at least
                           base-less, I have never found the language to
                           discuss this with them. Part of me doesn’t
                           care, but part of me is curious to find a way,
                           if possible, to make the CT understand. (I know
                           many CT’s are pretty average thinkers, but I
                           know some who are intelligent and even
                           reasonably logical–my inability to exchange
                           ideas [and facts] with the smart ones baffles
                           me.)

                                Thanks. Here’s something relatively new
                                I’ve been studying:

                                They work heavily with empirical
                                validation, and have some very interesting
                                ideas on how to persuade irrational
                                people. Perhaps more importantly, they
                                have some useful thoughts on how not to
                                try to persuade them.

                 This video is the first in a series exploring myths about
                 vaccination. After an introduction and quick history of
                 vaccinations, the concept of vaccinations being safe is
                 explored. By the dentist, naturopath and author, Dr
                 Alison Adams. For more information about recovering from

                      RE your second to last link, in which is written
                      “Ms. Wallace writes about Dr. Offit, “… he boldly
                      states – that vaccines do not cause autism or
                      autoimmune disease or any of the other chronic
                      conditions that have been blamed on them.” ”
                      Offit is a liar. I don’t say this to be insulting,
                      but anyone who would make the claim that vaccines
                      don’t cause autoimmune disease is being dishonest at
                      best. Nearly every vaccine insert includes one or
                      more autoimmune diseases as an adverse reaction.
                      Including ITP, which is the one my son ended up in
                      hospital with after getting the MMR shot. If ever
                      there was a time for someone’s pants to catch fire…

                           The diseases also cause autoimmune diseases.
                           Influenza causes GBS. Measles can also cause
                           ITP.:

     The risk of ITP developing as a result of the MMR vaccination is now
     estimated at 1 in 22,300 doses, but this is considerably less than
     the risk of ITP developing following the illnesses themselves.
     Measles induced ITP is common, rubella is estimated at 1 in 3000
     cases, and even mumps is occasionally associated with ITP. Of
     course, there are many more serious complications of these diseases
     than ITP.
                           Please post the PubMed indexed study by
                           qualified reputable researchers that any
                           vaccine on the American pediatric schedule
                           causes more autoimmune diseases than the actual
                           diseases. Do not mention VAERS nor vaccine
                           package inserts.

                           Offit has made claiming that vaccines never
                           cause autoimmune disease, as you seem to be

                 I have no problems with the points you make. Actually,
                 I’m for them. But it shows quite the amount of ignorance
                 to think that an scupuncturist isn’t a capable medical
                 practitioner or is not highly learned in medicine. If
                 anything they are more informed and have a better
                 understanding of the body in many ways to modern
                 “traditional” doctors in the sense that as part of their
                 schooling they learn but occidental and oriental medical
                 theory and treatment practices, which includes
                 considering the various systems of the body as a
                 coherent, dependent whole. Not the ridiculous western
                 notion that the various systems are independent of one
                 another and can be treated as such like some machine you
                 can just remove, alter, and replace parts in without
                 affecting the entire summation of the organism in some
                 way (including the mind). On top of that, if you don’t
                 think that sticking needles in the body works why don’t
                 you go test it out for yourself? It’s not expensive. And
                 I’m sure you’ll find relief for things OVC and other non

                 One should never get vaccine information from a

       what a bunch of lies and disinformation. My child almost died after
       getting shot up and spent the following first year of her life
       scratching the skin off her flesh. People like the author of this
       text have no consciousness and likely work for the Pharma-cartell
       making billions of the shots and even more precious billions for
       the chronic diseases that need lifelong treatment. Only a sick
       person is good business, this insane system doesnt profit from
       health so keeping everyone sick is best suited for the
       Anglo-American dream of swimming in beautiful green precious paper.
       If that means injecting kids with a cocktail of
       formaldehyde,aluminum and formaldehyde(...) that in some cases
       kills them, then so be it, no problem either legally or morally.
       Its not like anyone is going to be prosecuted either, once a
       corporation reaches the billion profit mark it is excused from the
       law and can poison us or earth as they please. What are the victims
       going to do? Go to court and face a team of lawyers for the next
       20years or until they bankrupt.
       To difference right from wrong seems to be a major issue in modern
       civilization. Low-lives like the author of the above whos name is
       very likely not Jenifer and maybe not even a female deliberately
       spread these reports. Sounds like the lies of a sad, barely human
       creature sitting in an office located in a Big Pharma-Building has
       put this rubbish to paper, making sure revenue won`t drop and
       surely to give his masters ass a good licking, the proper way to
       get to the top and sack the most precious paper.
       You are scum and I hope you get what you deserve. I hope the dead

            Odee–
            I am sorry that your child was sick, and I hope that she is
            feeling better now. I understand that I won’t be able to
            change your mind on this issue, or convince you that I
            genuinely care about alleviating suffering in children.
            The reason that I insist on a scientific, not anecdotal,
            approach to the question of whether or not vaccines are safe
            and effective at preventing diseases, is that it’s very easy
            to see a relationship between two events (a child got a shot,
            a child got sick) even if something else may be the cause. Did
            the child get exposed to another illness at the same time as
            the shot? Did the child have a genetic condition that
            predisposed him or her to the condition? We humans are very
            good at seeing patterns, but sometimes that ability fools us.
            You can’t tell whether something caused something else from
            just one incident. It’s only when we look at thousands and
            thousands of cases that we’re able to eliminate different
            variables that might be complicating the story, and
            effectively figure out an answer to these questions. But
            because we’re talking about children, it’s a very emotionally
            fraught situation, and it’s quite natural to fixate on one
            thing as the cause–even if that thing is not actually the
            cause at all. Being upset is very understandable, but the
            problem is that we can’t move forward very effectively on
            finding the true cause of certain issues (I’m thinking
            specifically of autism here) when we have to keep revisiting
            factors that have already been shown (through research on
            millions of cases at this point) to not be the cause.
            I don’t know the specifics of your child’s illness, but I hope
            that you were able to find a good physician to discuss your
            concerns and to get treatment for her.
            You are free to call me names and wish me to suffer as much as
            you want. I hope that it makes you feel better, because it
            sounds like you and your family have gone through a lot of
            stress. I am sorry for all that you’ve had to experience. But
            you should know that you’re wrong about your assumptions of
            me. I really am a female, and my name really is Jennifer. I’ve
            posted my CV on this site so you can see for yourself what my
            background is, and who I work for. I don’t work for a
            pharmaceutical company. And I probably make less money than
            you do.
            I understand that you’re angry with me, but I’m not some
            cartoon villain in cahoots with evil companies to kill babies
            for profit. If you knew me as a person, not just a blog post,
            you might better understand my good intentions.

            any scientific backing, evidence or proof for any of your rant

            “What are the victims going to do? Go to court and face a team
            of lawyers for the next 20years or until they bankrupt.”
            The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program pays for the
            claimants’ lawyers, and often the expert witnesses. The
            information on NVICP is included on the vaccine information
            sheets that federal law requires be provided each time one is
            administered:
            http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/index.html
            Unfortunately there is no such program for those of us whose
            children have been harmed by an actual disease before its
            vaccine was available. Our oldest child had seizures from a
            now vaccine preventable disease, plus he has a severe genetic
            heart condition. We know all about ambulances, hospitals,
            years of speech/language therapy (most not covered by
            insurance) and special ed. systems. This is why I prefer
            information comparing the relative risks between vaccines and
            the diseases, because the diseases are not always “mild.”

            I am so sorry to read this I do hope however you read the
            replies to the article as they show the legal system has taken
            steps to support your terrible position. Per Colin: 1 in 1.5
            million case and taken the proper legal steps I am sure you
            would have been more than accepting of a share in a 2.5
            billion dollar pie for those rare cases, like yours, that are
            effected adversely by vaccinations. I personally was
            vaccinated, every child in my family was vaccinated and they
            are well. And while that may not console you, it should raise
            the question, “Was something different in my child than in
            their’s that made mine more susceptible?” It happens and it is
            terrible, but so do car accidents and so do fires and so do so
            many other terrible on in a millions that could not be
            predicted before they happened. Clearly when your child was
            being vaccinated you were comfortable with the overwhelming
            research and number of children who were safe after being
            vaccinated. If you truly wish to make a stand please do at
            least some research on both ends and learn that all this
            anti-“pharma-cartell” is in itself propoganda for someone else
            too. I am a full advocate of natural lifestyles, but I also
            recognize that the safety of my children and others cannot
            always be fixed by vegetables, breast milk and natural birth…
            some things are for the greater good and after reading the
            serious lack of evidence and logic behind anti-vax reports I
            feel entirely more comfortable with vaccinating and possibly
            saving the lives of my children and your children’s children.

       mumps, rubella, polio, and whooping cough from 2008-2014.
       http://www.cfr.org/interactives/GH_Vaccine_Map/#map
       btw, is it under-reporting that NSW, Australia would have the
       highest rate of whooping cough globally at 13,046? Shocking
       statistic.

       Liest sich für mich, wie ein Text, der von der Impflobby
       geschrieben wurde. Viele Punkte sind oberflächlich & stellenweise
       falsch angegeben. Fazit nicht glaubwürdig!
       Beispiel MMR Impfstoff: dieser hat teilweise sehr massive
       Nebenwirkungen, u.a. kann er Epilepsie auslösen.
       6-fach Impfung: ich kenne ein Kind, dass nach der Impfung eine
       polioähnliche Erkrankung bekommen hat, inkl. einer massiven
       Entwicklungsverzögerung (Entwicklungsrückschritt). Der Impfschaden
       wurde abgeschmettert & geleugnet. Die Eltern stehen jetzt mit ihren
       kranken Kind alleine da & müssen sehen, wie sie klar kommen.
       Man kann einfach nicht so verallgemeinern. Die Krankheiten sind
       komplex & auch ihre Gefahren. Und genauso die Impfungen. Es gibt
       Krankheiten mit schlimmen Folgen & es gibt Impfungen mit schlimmen
       Folgen. Jede Krankheit & Impfung muß für sich, einzeln betrachtet
       werden, um zu einem objektiven Ergebnis kommen zu können.
       Ich könnte den Text mehr oder weniger komplett zerflücken &
       fachlich korrigieren. Aber das würde den Rahmen hier sprengen.
       Frau Raff schreibt für mich absolut unwissenschaftlich. Als
       Wissenschaftlerin, sollte sie eigentlich wissen, dass man die Dinge
       nicht einfach nur schwarz oder weiß sehen kann & das die gesamte
       Materie viel zu komplex ist. Unser Immunsystem ist tausende von
       Jahren ohne Impfung ausgekommen (nur mal als wissentschaftlicher
       Fakt & Ansatz) & hat auch tausende von Jahren gebraucht, um sich so
       wunderbar zu entwickeln.
       Was natürlich nicht bedeutet, dass alle Impfungen gleich schlecht
       sind aber wir sollten sie mit Vorsicht & Umsicht einsetzten. Was
       wissen wir schon? Was machen wir mit den Impfungen eventl. kaputt?
       Wir impfen seit ca. 100 Jahren & davor steht die Evolution mit
       tausenden von Jahren. Nur als Denkanregung.

            Using Google Translate:

     Reads to me as a text that was written by the Impflobby. Many points
     are given superficial and in places wrong. Conclusion not credible!
     Example MMR vaccine: this has some very serious side effects,
     including it can trigger epilepsy. 6-fold vaccination: I know a
     child that was named after the vaccination, a polio-like illness,
     including a massive developmental delay (development backspace). The
     vaccine damage was shot down and denied. The parents are now with
     her ​​sick child there alone & have to see how they cope. You simply
     can not generalize like that. The diseases are complex and their
     dangers. And just as the vaccinations. There are diseases with dire
     consequences and there are vaccinations with dire consequences. Any
     disease & vaccination must be considered individually on their own
     in order to come to an objective result. I could zerflücken the text
     more or less complete & correct technically. But that is beyond the
     scope here. Ms. Raff writes absolutely unscientific for me. As a
     scientist, she was supposed to know that the things you can not just
     black or white see & that is all the matter much too complex. Our
     immune system is thousands of years got along without vaccination
     (only sometimes as wissentschaftlicher Fact & approach) & also has
     thousands of years needed to develop so wonderful. This does not
     mean of course that all vaccines are equally bad but we should they
     used with caution & care. What do we know? What we do tolls with the
     vaccinations. broken? We vaccinate for about 100 years and preceded
     by the evolution of thousands of years. Just as a thought
     stimulation.
            “Example MMR vaccine: this has some very serious side effects,
            including it can trigger epilepsy. ”
            Citation needed. Show that the MMR is actually more dangerous
            than measles. The disease actually causes encephalitis in one
            out of a thousand cases, see The Clinical Significance of
            Measles: A Review.
            “Ms. Raff writes absolutely unscientific for me. ”
            Well, this is a blog post not a scientific paper. How about
            you show us some of the science. For example you next say:
            “Our immune system is thousands of years got along without
            vaccination..”, now follow up with a scientific study showing
            that child mortality was less a thousand years ago than it is
            today.
            Though here is one video on the joys of measles that you might

       I’ve posted here before, and I am always amazed at the complete
       dichotomy of opinions and “facts” posted. Those supporting
       vaccination usually use statistics and published references to the
       CDC, NIH, JAMA, Journal of Pediatrics, etc. Those opposing
       vaccinations often quote from websites like naturalnews.com and
       vactruth.com.
       On April 5, 2014, someone named Jon posted his argument against
       vaccinations, and included a link to a slide presentation. In
       addition to the anti-vaccination message, some of the slides
       compared the medical community to Nazis and a host of conspiracy
       groups.
       On slide 12 of the presentation a table tried to show that diseases
       were going away without vaccines. The diseases included Diphtheria,
       Pertussis, Measles, Polio, and others. This slide is an example of
       using statistics to enhance your argument, when the statistics
       don’t really pertain to your argument. For example, the graph on
       slide 12 indicates that the deaths from polio were declining
       throughout the 1930s and 1940s. But what this graph did not show
       was the newer medical interventions that were being introduced to
       save lives. The graph wasn’t intended to show how many cases. It
       only showed deaths.
       The fact is, in 1952, there were nearly 60,000 cases of polio in
       the U.S., and more children died of polio than any other
       communicable disease. I contracted a very severe case of polio in
       1953. I would have surely died if I had contracted polio in the
       1930s, 1940s, or even earlier in the 1950s. By 1953, if you were
       fortunate enough to live in a large metropolitan center with
       aggressive and knowledgeable medical staff, you would receive a
       tracheostomy and be placed in an iron lung. I received both of
       these within hours of diagnosis, and I lived.
       One of the “experts” those opposed to vaccines like to quote is Dr.
       Suzanne Humphries. She travels the lecture circuit trying her best
       to portray diseases as minor occurrences and vaccines as the worst
       thing that ever happened. She told an audience that most of those
       who are exposed to the polio virus don’t get paralyzed. Then she
       says that, even if you are exposed, most will just have the
       sniffles or a belly ache. And then she said, in a scoffing tone,
       “We’ve all had those haven’t we?” Her tone appears to convey the
       very false impression that polio is not so bad.
       I guess to Dr. Humphries polio is not bad. It would be an
       interesting experiment to put her, and the other anti-vaccine
       zealots, in a time machine and transport them back to 1952. Drop
       them off in a hospital filled with children and adults being kept
       alive in iron lungs. See if they think polio is “not so bad” then.
       And, I don’t want to hear any comments by anti-vaccination zealots
       that claim I would not have gotten polio if I had only eaten better
       foods, or taken more vitamins, or followed a certain regimen. My
       mother was a health “nut”. We had no junk food in the house. I was
       the perfect example of a healthy thirteen year old. Bacteria and
       viruses don’t discriminate!

            Thank you for your excellent rant, Mr. Daggett.
            I recently read a book called Extreme Medicine by Dr. Kevin
            Fong. In one chapter he tells of how the polio epidemic in
            Denmark spurred on the development to better artificial
            ventilation, which were initiated by Bjørn Ibsen, an
            anesthetist and others in Copenhagen. I found an essay about
            their work.
            It was medical improvements like this that reduced disease
            mortality. Vaccination just made it so they did not have to be
            used, since it is better to prevent than to treat.

       schedule as a child, but can no longer take new inoculations nor
       the annual flu shot (which is NOT a vaccine, but an immune booster

       I met Mark & David Gier. I saw their research. It is solid. I am
       amazed that their research is automatically discounted not because
       it wasn’t correct or verifiable but because their license was
       revoked. Noone says why it was revoked. What a convient way to
       discredit valid research. Yet cited articles by liscensed
       scientists that they don’t even pretend to be based on scientific
       methods is automatically accepted because they still have

            What is your basis for assessing their research as “valid”?
            Few medical or scientific experts agree; I’m curious what
            study you did to validate their conclusions.
            If you’re curious about why Mark Geier’s licenses were
            revoked, the Wikipedia article has links to each of the
            decisions. I’ve pasted some of the narrative below. David
            Geier was never licensed; he was fined $10,000 for practicing
            medicine without a license.
            “On April 27, 2011, the Maryland State Board of Physicians
            suspended Mark Geier’s medical license as an “emergency
            action”, saying he “endangers autistic children and exploits
            their parents by administering to the children a treatment
            protocol that has a known substantial risk of serious harm and
            which is neither consistent with evidence-based medicine nor
            generally accepted in the relevant scientific community.” [30]
            The board ruled that Geier misdiagnosed patients, diagnosed
            patients without sufficient tests, and recommended risky
            treatments without fully explaining the risks to the parents.
            They also ruled that he misrepresented his credentials,
            including during an interview with the board. Geier’s lawyer,
            Joseph A. Schwartz III said the basis of the complaint was a
            “bona fide dispute over therapy”, and hoped for a fair hearing
            to challenge the board’s accusations.[31]
            The suspension was reaffirmed in May 2011,[32] and upheld on
            appeal in March 2012, after a full evidentiary hearing before
            the Office of Administrative Hearings in Maryland.[33] Geier’s
            licenses to practice medicine in the states of Washington,[34]
            Virginia [35] and California [36] were suspended as well. In
            June 2012, Geier was charged with violation of the Maryland
            suspension by continuing to practice medicine without a
            license.[37] In August 2012, Geier’s license was formally
            revoked by the Maryland State Board of Physicians.[38] On 5
            November 2012, the Missouri Medical board and the Illinois
            Department of Financial and Professional Regulation revoked
            Geier’s license, both citing action taken by the Maryland
            State Board of Physicians.[39] On April 12, 2013, Geier’s last
            medical license in the United States was revoked by the state
            medical board of Hawaii.[40]“

            The Geiers lost their credibility years ago, and the Special
            Masters in the vaccine court cases had lots to say about lack
            of qualifications as “expert witnesses.” Instead of having you
            slog through a legal document, someone has posted some of
            those quotes at Is Mark Geier finished as an expert witness in
            the vaccine court?

       In my humble opinion, and after studying how this this artical has
       effected children, what autism is, how it works etc, I have decided
       I’d rather have a LIVING child rather than one that died due to a
       preventable disease. Because after reading a few comments, I kinda
       felt like these are adults who think they know what’s best in
       trying to protect their own children. But I felt like they have
       forgotten that these are tiny fragile lives who are just starting
       out in the world. These are the future leaders of the world. We
       shouldn’t argue over things we get to choose. We are all being
       watched by if you to generation. What we say and do now will affect
       them for the rest of their lives whether you give them that vaccine
       or not. Because the children who do you survive without getting any
       of these horrible diseases or autism or whatever else is out there
       is going to be the leaders someday. Be a good example.

       I personally think that some of the Anti-Vaccine trend has
       something to do with people not wanting their child getting hurt.
       16 years ago I had to go through it with my oldest son, and have
       recently been going through it again with my youngest son. It’s not
       fun going into the nurses room and watching her stab your little
       baby in the leg twice, making your baby cry and you getting to see
       them in such pain. However, I have always wanted my sons to grow up
       happy and healthy, so I as a parent choose to take them for their
       vaccines and hope that they do their job well enough to prevent my
       babies from getting ill.

       “It’s easier to scare peoplle then unscare them.” Unfortunately
       this is true. No one is going to start believing this until reports
       start showing that millions, possibly more, have died because
       people were not vaccinated. This will finally be a case were
       correlation is actually causation. I hope our society wakes up and
       reads the research before its too late.

       Dear Ms. Raff,
       In your blog I noted that you did not know what ‘Agent 666′ means.
       I’m not 100% certain on exactly what it means, but I believe I may
       be able to hazard an educated guess. You see, 666 is the number
       most commonly associated with the christian devil, hell, and all
       things fire and Brimstone. By logical extension, ‘Agent 666′ would
       imply that they believe you are an agent of Hell, or even the devil
       himself, determined to drag all our souls down into depravity.
       I myself believe no such thing, and honestly would be shocked to
       hear such an insult actually used on a woman of science. I wish you
       good luck in your work, and offer my support to the fullest extent
       I can, as this is an important issue to me, although in my current
       circumstances I cannot achieve much.
       And on behalf of we christians who also have room in our hearts for
       science, reason, and love, God bless you.

       OK im not going to pretend im qualified to really, really get into
       a debate over this. I dont have a lifetime of committment in
       studying vaccines. But here is my story, with my ONE question.
       Im in my 30s. I have had a autoimmune disease which has almost
       killed me. Ive had 7 life saving surgeries, ive had major organs
       “removed” which has saved me. (Advances in technology in Emergency
       Surgery in my opinion are phenomenal). Anyway. I am not some smelly
       hippy sitting under a tree without shoes “blaming big pharma”. Im a
       middle class, self made millionaire, white collar worker. I have
       two university degrees, (one in Health Science), self educated type
       of guy. Basically, the type the medical world have issues with as I
       question everything. My son had a mild/moderate reaction to his
       first shot. So with my autoimmune health issue/background, I am
       concerned that the vaccine MAY have a long term effect and MAY have
       involvement in triggering an autoimmune disease in himself as well.
       Now I WANT TO BELIEVE in the safety of vaccines. I truly do. But
       the reality is I am skeptical.
       I spent MONTHS tracking down all the expert doctors I could find
       trying to find someone who could show me the answer to 1
       question….. and if I had the answer, I would become 100% supporter
       of vaccines.
       If the medical world make that much money off vaccines, and we are
       talking BILLIONS, and we are talking shareholders that want
       returns, then there automatically has to be an element of profit
       over safety at SOME levels by some individuals. What I want, is a
       study comparing a mass group of vaccinated, to non-vaccinated, over
       a long period of time comparing the health of each group. Now if I
       was a huge pharma company, making millions off vaccines, I would
       WANT to do such a program, as it would win over THOUSANDS of people
       who currently sit on the fence (people like me). If there was some
       form of study over say 20 or 30 years, that showed health and
       disease comparison of vaccinated to non-vaccinated, and showed
       there was no difference, then to me it would be case closed and
       lets get on with it. But EVERY doctor I saw, and I saw over 30 of
       them over a 3 month period, not ONE could tell me there was even
       ONE study that met that challenge. Why? Why cant a company, that
       makes literally BILLIONS off vaccines, run a program that would
       meet that question head on, and hopefully answer it in their
       favour? The fact that the pharma companies havent done this, makes
       me very uneasy and very skeptical.
       There is no doubt vaccines can help the prevalence and severity of
       disease in infants. Thats not even a debatable subject now. But
       what effect does vaccines have on the long term health of the
       individual? What evidence do we have tracking immune related
       disease in vaccinated vs non-vaccinated through adulthood? No GP I
       have met has been able to show me ONE single worthwhile study that
       answers that.
       THAT allows me to draw some serious conclusions about these
       companies.
       Ive now chosen not to vaccine my child. And again, I ain’t some
       hippy under a tree. Im a well educated, middle class individual
       that has studied health science my whole life, that knows how to
       critique, question and challenge for the pursuit of clean truth.
       When a guy with my background comes to that conclusion, it has to
       raise concerns for the mum and dad who dont have a history of
       academia, havent ever studied health or science or anything
       remotely close to well being.
       I think theres absolutely every need for vaccinating to save
       children mortality. But there is currently a grey area that hasn’t
       been answered clearly yet, which is what does the long term effects
       create? Is there actually a difference in long term health of
       vaccinated to non-vacicnated? That HAS to be answered, and answered
       in a way that can not be challenged, or queried by some extreme
       anti-vaccine nutter with an agenda. It has to be answered in a way
       that shows absolutely no influence from the pharmaceutical
       companies or any other entity that has a financial interest in
       vaccines and can not be conducted by anyone that has the ability to
       be linked in a similar way. If that was done, half of these
       “anti-vaccine” supporters, would likely become
       “vaccine-supporters”. The rest are never going to be happy, they
       are the smelly hippies under a tree :-)
       So thats my two cents to the topic. No response/debate is going to
       change my mind on the matter, until I start seeing company after
       company after company conduct such mass studies over a long term,
       nothing will remove that current element of grey that allows the
       protesters to gain traction.

            That’s a great question, James. What IS the long term effect
            of vaccines? To answer that simply – no one knows.
            But then, what about every other medication on the market?
            Most studies will follow patients for a period of months but
            not their entire lives and any post-market effects are meant
            to be reported to the regulatory body that manages drugs.
            Science is not perfect, but it keeps innovating and keeps
            trying.
            To be quite honest, I think you chose the question to confirm
            your conspiracy theory anyway. At least be honest with
            yourself.

            James,
            I appreciate the civil tone and the coherence of your
            statements. Even the few words in caps are clearly to provide
            a sense of emphasis, that can otherwise be hard to provide in
            written communication without vulgarities. I recommend the
            vulgarities, but that’s just me. :-)
            You ask a clear question that deserves the best answer I can
            give, though I hope others will also provide answers that I’m
            not qualified to give. Your question, as I understand it, is:
            Why hasn’t anyone done the fairly obvious research study where
            children who were vaccinated decades earlier have their health
            history compared to children who were not vaccinated? If I’ve
            improperly characterized your question, please correct me.
            My answers are these:
            1) Doing a prospective randomized control trial would be
            unethical.
            I realize you were not necessarily asking for one, but it is
            the gold standard of scientific healthcare studies, so it
            should be addressed.
            Given the state of the science and knowledge base about
            epidemiology, immunology, and infectious disease, it would be
            entirely unethical to randomly assign one group of kids to be
            unvaccinated. No agency, university, or any other healthcare
            related group would permit it. That would be equivalent to the
            Tuskeegee syphilis study that permitted a group of men with
            syphilis remain untreated, just so we could know what would
            happen.
            2) Doing such a retrospective study would be difficult,
            expensive, and likely provide little useful information.
            I know that sounds like a cop-out, but please let me explain.
            A retrospective study would attempt to match children who were
            vaccinated against ones who were not, but what led the group
            to be unvaccinated would make them so unique as to be
            difficult to find matched control patients because
            A) For many, the reason that they were unvaccinated is because
            they had specific health problems that precluded vaccination.
            That means there should not be a single patient with the same
            health problem who was vaccinated.
            B) For some, the reason they were unvaccinated was lack of
            access (real or presumed by the family at the time) to
            healthcare services, which would mean that examination of
            their health records is not going to be accurate or thorough.
            If you matched such a patient to a vaccinated control, you are
            now requiring analysis of two healthcare records that you have
            already determined are incomplete.
            C) For some, the reason they were unvaccinated was a parental
            choice to avoid/decline vaccination. If that choice extends to
            other healthcare interventions, and this again creates a
            healthcare record that will be nearly impossible to match to a
            control because of the incompleteness of the record, and the
            likelihood that some professional interventions that were
            ignored after prescription, or that there were other
            interventions applied that were never in the health record,
            i.e. folk remedies or alternative medicine remedies. This
            statement is not an indictment of folk or alternative
            remedies. (I don’t condone them.
            There are medical interventions that work, and there are
            alternative medical interventions.) This is just about the
            impossibility of doing careful control matching when you don’t
            know what interventions were or weren’t used.
            3) Doing such a retrospective study would be enormously
            expensive.
            That alone is not a reason to avoid doing the study, but it is
            something to be considered.
            You are correct that Pharma companies are not going to to
            research they do not have to do. Why would any privately held
            or corporate entity do that? That very problem is a reason to
            more competently fund NIH, since we cannot rely on Pharma to
            do the studies we want on their dime. But under the current
            system, we cannot reasonably expect Pharma to do such studies.
            As shown above, the difficulties would make such a study very
            labor intensive, and that means expensive.
            So why doesn’t NIH take on the task of doing that? See #4
            below.
            4) Doing such a retrospective study would provide little
            useful information for the resouces required. As you see, this
            is related to #3.
            Let’s take a non-healthcare example. Could we test whether a
            moon can be created by coalescence of dust as is presumed from
            the current theories? Sure. Should we. No.
            It would require the use of resources so massive (in labor,
            technology, money) that it would not be practical. Then the
            question must me asked, “So would doing a job that big make as
            big a difference in what we know? Is there any reason to think
            there will be enough new information to make the investment
            worthwhile?” In the case of making a moon, not really. In the
            case of vaccination, not really.
            What would one expect to get from such a study that you do not
            have from the results of millions upon millions upon millions
            of observational case studies, i.e. real life?
            Is there a hint of any long term health deficit from
            vaccination? Is there any hint of a signal of long-term health
            problems? Is there any realisitic suggestion of a mechanism
            that might be causing such a problem? No. No. No. No.
            If there is, then I’ll happily sign on to support designing
            studies that might start to tease out what those signals are
            and what they mean (long before bothering with a full-blown
            case control or cohort retrospective study). But there just
            isn’t one.
            Would it be nice if we could the gigantic study to test every
            thougthful question? Sure.
            Do we live in the world that makes that possible? No.
            Those are my off-the-cuff answers as to why the study you want
            has not been done.
            I’m open to correction from Dr Raff, Chris, Colin, or anyone
            else.
            So, James, way too many words later, let me ask you…
            What study design do you want done? Please be specific.
            Who would do it (so that you would trust the results)?
            How would you fund it?
            Would you raise taxes to pay for it?
            Would you redirect money from other government services?
            Would you insist that vaccine producing companies pay out
            billions for the study?
            What if they don’t choose to do the study?
            What if they decline to produce vaccines if funding this study
            becomes a mandate?
            Why would you insist this study be done?
            What reason do you have to believe that such a study would
            provide useful, important information?

            the type you suggest for anything else we consume/do you in

            Yes, a neurological syndrome has managed to show the day after
            the vaccination. If they had been taken to be vaccinated a
            week later the boy would have been mute for a week already.
            What you are trying to do here is called a “post hoc, ergo
            propter hoc” fallacy: event B happens after event A, so event
            A caused event B. What you don’t take into account is that
            neurological problems don’t show up in one day.

       One of the more troubling aspects of this so-called debate is how
       long it has been going on and how persistent the skeptics have been
       in the face of all evidence. On Dec. 30, 1736, for example,
       Benjamin Franklin published this brief note (reproduced here with
       modernized spelling, punctuation and capitalization) about the
       death of his 4-year-old son, Francis, who had become something of a
       favorite with his father:
       “Understanding it is a current report that my son Francis, who died
       lately of the smallpox, had it by inoculation; and being desired to
       satisfy the public in that particular, inasmuch as some people are,
       by that report (joined with others of the like kind and perhaps
       equally groundless) deterred from having that operation performed
       on their children, I do hereby sincerely declare, that he was not
       inoculated, but received the distemper in the common way of
       infection: And I suppose the report could only arise from my known
       opinion, that inoculation was a safe and beneficial practice, and
       from my having said among my acquaintance that I intended to have
       my child inoculated as soon as he should have recovered sufficient
       strength from a flux with which he had been long afflicted.”
       Forty-eight years later, Franklin still felt remorse over not
       having his son immunized and still grieved over the death. His
       autobiography, written in 1784, includes this paragraph:
       “In 1736, I lost one of my sons, a fine boy of four years old, by
       the smallpox taken in the common way. I long regretted bitterly,
       and still regret, that I had not given it to him by inoculation.
       This I mention for the sake of parents who omit that operation on
       the supposition that they should never forgive themselves if a
       child died under it — my example showing that the regret may be the
       same either way, and that therefore the safer should be chosen.”
       Among those who agreed with Franklin’s view on inoculation was
       George Washington, who in 1776 ordered that every soldier in the
       Continental Army be immunized. Napoleon issued similar orders for
       the French army in 1805.
       Current vaccines are vastly safer than the smallpox inoculation of
       Ben Franklin’s day.
       Those who don’t believe what Dr. Raff and Dr. Offit say, should at
       least trust Ben Franklin and George Washington.

       Hello Jennifer – I’m a mom of 6 and the only experience I have is
       having been through all the regular childhood diseases – I’m not a
       Anti-Vaccination person or a scientist, researcher or even someone
       with vast knowledge of anything – just a mom with 25 years
       experience with kids – I AM however a huge believer that our bodies
       are built to handle most what we encounter. I do believe Small Pox,
       Polio, etc should be vaccinated against – these vaccines have been
       proven to stop these deadly, contagious illnesses – BUT the chicken
       pox vaccine says it’s only good for 25 years (I read that in the
       brochure the Dr. gave me about the side effects – YES I read the
       whole thing) and please correct me if I’m wrong but isn’t chicken
       pox more dangerous – even deadly – as an adult versus a child? I
       believe I would much rather have my child contract it and deal with
       it for a week (like the good old days) where he never deals with it
       again than to get it (and maybe shingles or worse) as an adult. One
       of my sons had the Whooping cough until he was like 12 so that is
       just laughable. Also, the flu – if you have a strong immune system,
       wouldn’t it be just better to get it “naturally” 3-4 days to build
       that tolerance of the “local” strain than to take a risk and get a
       variety of the “man-made’ version which you can get sick off of
       too? If you had a weaken immune, like the elderly or already sick,
       maybe then it might be worth it to prevent a harder blow. So I
       guess, my response to your saying the chicken pox is not a big deal
       or the flu is not dangerous – it depends – Some vaccines are good
       because the risk of the man-made injection out weighs the risk of
       the disease – but some vaccines are still, just not worth the risk
       – and I don’t care about your credentials or all the data to back
       you up – The medical and pharma industry has always been one to
       think they “know” what’s best but they still have a lot (in my
       opinion) still left to learn about our wonderful human bodies.

            I’d be willing to bet that Odee didn’t even read your article,
            she/he just saw the headline and maybe read a few sentences.
            Too often people make the wrong assumptions based on incorrect
            correlations. Most people don’t really understand what makes
            good, sound, solid research. Most people also have very narrow
            views of the world and only think about how things affect them
            and not others. Having grown up in the 60s I had chicken pox,
            measles, scarlet fever and the flu. The measles vaccine came
            out after I already had been infected but my two sisters and I
            got the vaccine anyway. We were happy to do it because it
            meant we wouldn’t get sick again. I do not like being sick and
            I don’t know many people who do. I’ve read a lot of history on
            epidemics such as the Spanish flu and polio. I think you are
            right when you say that the creation of vaccines has been one
            of the most important tools of modern health care in that it
            prevents terrible diseases and allows us to remain healthy and
            ultimately live longer. This is a great article, well written,
            simple and articulate. I love your advice to people to do
            their own research and to look at the qualifications of the
            researchers, their credentials and how the research was done.

            Sally, I’m very sorry for your son’s condition. However, I’m
            not so sure you truly understand what you are asking, making
            such a generalized plea as you have done.
            I didn’t vaccinate my children based on family medical
            history. On my side, there are several close relatives who
            have had autoimmune diseases and seizures. My children were
            given some vaccines without my permission, and as I feared,
            one of them developed an autoimmune disease from one of the
            shots. The disease he developed is one that is listed as an
            adverse reaction on the manufacturer’s informational insert.
            Had my son not been given the vaccine, he would not have spent
            3 days in the hospital with a life-threatening disease that
            caused his immune system to chew up his blood platelets faster
            than his body could produce them. He wouldn’t have had umpteen
            gazillion follow-up visits to check and make sure that the
            treatment for the disease (which had a whole set of potential
            risks of it’s own and caused him to spend an entire day while
            in hospital throwing up and pressing his little hands to his
            head because he was in so much pain, and there was absolutely
            NOTHING I could do to help him feel better) was working as it
            was supposed to. His immune system wouldn’t have been
            compromised. How do you keep a child healthy by compromising
            his immune system?
            I’m sorry for your son’s condition. But you have to understand
            that there are more sides to this story. I won’t say that you
            have no right to ask it, but no one has the right to remove
            another parent’s right to say “no” in response to such a
            request. I’ll not risk my child having a relapse of that
            disease. I won’t risk my other child developing it, or one
            similar, or for either of them to have seizures. These are all
            documented reactions that some people can get. The problem
            with adverse reactions is that you can’t know it’ll happen
            until it happens. So parents are left to do their own research
            and make their decisions for their own families. I would never
            ask another parent to put something into their child’s body
            because I believed it would protect my child. Someone used the
            phrase “taking one for the team” in this instance. One of my
            children has already done that. I could have prevented it, had
            I stood my ground.

                 “I didn’t vaccinate my children based on family medical
                 history.”
                 Then just like Sally you should be encouraging everyone
                 to vaccinate to protect your family through community
                 immunity.
                 “The disease he developed is one that is listed as an
                 adverse reaction on the manufacturer’s informational
                 insert. Had my son not been given the vaccine, he would
                 not have spent 3 days in the hospital with a
                 life-threatening disease that caused his immune system to
                 chew up his blood platelets faster than his body could
                 produce them.”
                 Which is why it is listed as a table injury. it is still
                 a rare event, and was actually more common in the era
                 before measles, mumps and rubella vaccination.

                 From
                 http://www.harpocratesspeaks.com/2011/04/acute-thrombocyt
                 openic-purpura-mmr-and.html :

     In 1951, Fisher and Kraszewski (PDF) described two cases of
     thrombocytopenic purpura following natural measles infection. Cines,
     et al. (2009), describe numerous causes of TP, including autoimmune
     disorders (e.g., lupus) and chronic infections (HIV, Hepatitis C, H.
     pylori), as well as following natural infection with rubella,
     varicella zoster virus (chicken pox) and many other viruses.
     Yenicesu, et al. (2002), found that following viral infection, ITP
     occurred about 13.3% of the time. Likewise, Rajantie, et al. (2007)
     found that thrombocytopenic purpura occurs more frequently following
     natural infection than after immunization, and that
     vaccien-associated TP is generally mild and resolves within 6 months
     in about 90% of cases. Ünal, et al. (2009), also describe mumps as a
     cause of ATP. Tucci, et al. (1980) discovered subclinical
     thrombocytopenic purpura in 55% of children with measles, 25% of
     children with mumps and 30% of children with rubella, among other
     viral causes. Finally, in the same CDC report stating that ATP
     occurs in about 1:30,000-1:40,000 (~2-4:100,000) cases following
     vaccination, it was also reported that ATP occurs in about 1:3,000
     (33:100,000) cases of rubella.

       As a mother of a child whom I sat with in the hospital for a week
       after an emergency surgery at the age of four months, I feel new
       vaccines have not been properly tested. You would definitely have a
       different out look on vaccines if your child received the
       rotoshield vaccine and within 4 days ended up in the hospital for
       intersuception (the floating intestines attached to the stomach
       wall causing them to telescope within themselves to create a
       blockage). They pulled the vaccine off the market a week after his
       discharge from the hospital do to it causing intersuception. It
       pains me to think that I could have prevented all of his suffering
       and our being blindsided by the thought of the possibility of
       losing our only child by saying no to new vaccine that was supposed
       to help prevent rotovirus. Now they have come out with a new
       vaccine for rotavirus I certainly hope for those mothers out there
       who choose to give their child this specific vaccine that it causes
       a whole lot less heartache than the last one they put on the
       market.

            I’m very sorry for your child’s suffering! I hope he or she is
            doing well today.
            “I feel new vaccines have not been properly tested”
            Do you feel that because you’ve researched the testing regimen
            for new vaccines and compared it to an acceptable standard, or
            is it something you feel in your gut? I’m honestly curious;
            two paths to the same conclusion call for two vastly different
            conversations.
            “You would definitely have a different out look on vaccines if
            your child received the rotoshield vaccine and within 4 days
            ended up in the hospital for intersuception”
            That’s certainly possible. On the other hand, do you feel that
            such an experience might compromise my objectivity? Or that
            it’s a substitute for an analytical assessment of the known
            risks and benefits?

            “rotoshield vaccine”
            I am so sorry for your experience. Trust me I know about
            hospitals (my son had open heart surgery a couple of years ago
            for a genetic cardiac disorder). He also ended up in the
            hospital after a bout with rotavirus, so the disease is not
            benign. He was one of the the 137,000 emergency department
            visits and 256,000 office visits that occurred in 1989. (by
            the way, that page lies… since the article is more than five
            years old and it is no longer free to download)
            Yeah, the day before he had the seizure from dehydration he
            was seen by our family doctor because of the more than a week
            of rivers of poo, and refusal to drink pedialyte. The doctor
            noticed he was quite chipper so the kid must have been on the
            mend. The day after the kid got IV fluids at the hospital our
            family doctor called to apologize.
            Unfortunately your child was one of the several who was
            injured by that vaccine. But the VAERS surveillance system did
            provide an alert that after several thousands of those
            vaccinated it ended up with a much too high rate of
            complication, and it was withdrawn in less than a year of use.
            More information here.

       I CAN’T BELIEVE PARENTS WHO DON’T VACCINATE THEIR KIDS AREN’T
       CHARGED WITH MURDER. VACCINATE YOUR KIDS– THINK ABOUT OTHER KIDS,
       PEOPLE WITH COMPROMISED IMMUNE SYSTEMS AND PEOPLE WHO DON’T WANT TO
       DIE BECAUSE YOU’RE TOO STUPID TO READ THE ACTUAL SCIENCE BEHIND
       VACCINATION. You’re putting your own kids at risk – that’s cool
       with you? Sick, sick, sick.

       Here’s an interesting metaphor: I unknowingly contract HPV, have
       unprotected sex resulting in a woman contracting the virus, she
       develops cervix cancer, but no repercussions for me because I was
       relying on females to have had the vaccine and thus “herd
       immunity”. <—-What I think everytime an anti-vaccine proponent
       makes that argument.
