2014 SXSW Interactive Session Spotlight: It's Not About Tech – Hack The
Bureaucracy

   Written by Megan Simpson | February 7, 2014
   InteractiveSessionsSession Spotlight

   At SXSW 2014, Richard Boly encourages geeks to hack the government

   Do you wonder why the healthcare.gov website was such a hairball? Do
   you fear that your insight into the workings of the federal government
   tend to lean toward a caricature of 6th grade civics or Ayn Rand? Do
   you wonder what motivates government employees, government appointees
   and elected officials? If you’ve asked yourself one or more of these
   questions, be sure to attend “It's Not About Tech: Hack The
   Bureaucracy” at SXSW Interactive this March. Washington D.C. native,
   Richard Boly will speak about navigating government bureaucracy in
   order to innovate. Connect with him on Twitter @beaurichly.

   SXSW: Can you tell us more about getting the government to adopt new
   technologies?
   Boly: Bringing geeks into government won’t make a difference if they
   can’t crack the code on bureaucracies (and the politicos and government
   workers who run them). A hyper focus on technical problem solving by
   newcomers to the government space will have limited success and may
   actually do harm, if not matched with empathetic skills and an
   understanding of the sometimes perverse incentives facing the millions
   of U.S. career government employees. Don’t lose heart! True innovators
   embrace constraints - technical, temporal, resource, etc. Working with
   and within governments brings its own set of constraints. Once you
   understand them, innovation and technological change becomes easier, if
   not easy. Identifying and engaging early with the keepers of the status
   quo works much better than a stealth approach. Bringing your tech ninja
   skills to government can be great, if you come with eyes wide open.
   This session will open your eyes.

   SXSW: Have you spoken about this before?
   Boly: Yes, I have spoken at several Washington DC conference on this
   subject. The response was favorable, but I believe a discussion format
   at SXSW will be even more fruitful.

   SXSW: Can you share a little bit about Jed Sundwall, who is scheduled
   to join you for this session?
   Boly: Jed has worked for and with city and federal agencies and runs a
   successful venture, Measured Voice, which was incubated at the Code for
   America bootcamp.

   SXSW: What are the best books or articles you’ve read in relation to
   your SXSW topic?
   Boly: The books which have most influenced my thinking on incentives in
   government is The Death of Common Sense: How Law Is Suffocating America
   by Philip K. Howard and Clash!: 8 Cultural Conflicts That Make Us Who
   We Are by Hazel Rose Markus and Alana Conner.

   SXSW: What is your favorite aspect of SXSW? What have your past
   experiences at the festival been like?
   Boly: Being surprised by the unexpected. This will be my third SXSW
   Interactive in the last four years. The trick is to squeeze the most
   out of the big sessions, while meeting as many new people by creating
   intimate spaces among the hoard. Easier said than done, but worth the
   effort.

   SXSW: Who or what inspires your creativity?
   Boly: George Stack. He died years ago, but as a disaffected youth, he
   was the neighborhood handyman/inventor. Today he would be a maker
   ninja. There was nothing he couldn't make or fix. As a teen during WWII
   in the shipyards, he redesigned the wiring of battleships, finding ways
   to save tons of copper wiring.
