You Don't Get to the 21st Century by Arresting Journalists

   July 30, 2014

   I was not shocked utterly last week that Washington Post Iran
   correspondent, and my friend, Jason Rezaian, his wife Yeganeh Salehi
   and two other journalists were arrested without charges or explanation.

   He knows that there is not one Iran, that forces looking to the 21st
   century battle — as such forces around the world today are battling —
   defenders of the status quo. I had assumed, perhaps naively, that they
   knew supporting people like these four was the surest sign that
   political leadership is comfortable enough in its own skin to welcome
   greater transparency.

   I was not shocked, but I am disgusted.

   American raised, always connected to his heritage in Iran, Jason is
   what is best in outstanding journalism. He combines the smart
   skepticism to dig further that is required in a great newsperson with a
   clear and beautiful writing style. And yet, unlike many cynical, even
   defeatist, reporters I know and have worked with — he has a wonderful
   sense of hope and potential. His love of Iran, its history, culture and
   people is infectious. His understanding of its potential in this new
   millennia is unmatched. He convinced me, as a businessman and
   fascinated by generational shifts world wide, that something truly
   different is rising there.

   I am perhaps one of less than 500 Americans to visit Iran in the last
   year. In May, I joined a dozen CEOs from the US, Canada and the UK to
   visit this extraordinary culture touring from Tehran south through
   Isfahan to Shiraz. Little of what we saw was what we expected. While
   signs of its police state were clear, we saw a vibrancy and excitement
   of a society eager to join the 21st century global economy.

   Hope in particular was universally expressed in the new leadership of
   President Rouhani and his team. They, it was said repeatedly to me,
   were uniquely committed to navigate fairly a strong sense of tradition
   and culture while opening the extraordinary and broad talent of this
   country to innovate and have better lives. Equally universal hope for a
   thaw in relationships with the United States was clearly less a "turn
   to the west," as an opportunity to take their own rightful place in the
   world. The region, Turkey, Dubai, Asia and Europe are all poised to
   lock arms with Iran as a perfect cultural and business connector
   east-west/north-south.

   I reported this trip overall in some detail in the Harvard Business
   Review and in my particular area of experience — tech startups around
   the world — I was stunned by the potential I saw in Iran's new
   generation, and described it in Pando Daily.

   What we in the West miss most in Iran and in many emerging growth
   markets is this: the new generation under 30 frames the world utterly
   different than their parents. Raised on technology, seeing daily what
   is happening around the globe, using tools to share, collaborate and
   create, they want to take hold of the future. Suspect of regimes who
   have cracked down on them in the past, they are in fact quite hopeful —
   desperately looking for evidence of leadership that is on their sides
   and they can support.

   We see everywhere — in Iran, the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and even
   here in the United States and Europe — top down institutions showing
   their disdain for one of the most historic and least understood
   phenomena in human history: that, bottom up, people have tools and
   connectedness to solve their own problems and capture and innovate new
   opportunities. Rather than embracing this power in their resource
   constrained and often ineffectual "policies," they fight for the status
   quo. They fight, of course, for their power in the only way they
   understand it.

   We sit on the cusp — for all the pain and uncertainty we see in the
   news daily — of an unleashing of societies, especially emerging
   societies, to create remarkable outcomes.

   For the institutions and leaders that embrace these changes, lead where
   they can, they can help coauthor results their current paths almost
   certainly will never achieve.

   Embracing the transparency, openness and innovation being unleashed is
   a prerequisite.

   Allowing the free flow of people, ideas and thought is a necessity.

   I pray the powers that are sparring now in Iran choose the future. And
   a good way to signal to all that they mean it is to release Jason and
   other journalists doing exactly what they should be embracing.
