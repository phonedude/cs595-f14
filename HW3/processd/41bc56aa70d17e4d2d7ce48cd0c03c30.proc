Read Andy Oram’s Article “Does Network Neutrality Really Matter?” Please.

   I don’t usually write a blog post just to say “go read this other
   person’s blog post”, but some cases are worth an exception. Andy Oram’s
   recent post at O’Reilly Radar

   Does net neutrality really matter?

   is a must-read if you think you know where you stand on network
   neutrality.

   The million comments received by the FCC (and one of them was mine)
   certainly indicated a healthy interest and watchfulness on the part of
   the public; with luck, the FCC will understand them that way. But the
   simplistic recommendation virtually all of us made in those comments,
   essentially that the FCC should grab the bluntest and most direct
   instrument at hand, Title II authority, and use it to regulate Internet
   traffic in a one-size-fits-all way, may not be the best outcome for the
   Internet. Andy Oram’s post explains why.

   I still think that wave of comments was, overall, a good thing. The
   FCC, and by extension Congress, are now very aware that if smaller
   players start to have real trouble getting good Internet connections
   (inbound or outbound), it will be an electoral issue. But just because
   the comments demonstrate vigilance doesn’t mean they’re actually making
   the best technical recommendation available. After reading Andy’s post,
   you’ll understand why. In particular, follow his link to Michael
   Powell’s comment about the “Mercedes Divide”.

   Once again, Andy Oram’s post:

       Using Title II as a source of authority is the wrong idea. It’s
       Title II as the basis for competition at the physical layer that
       you want. The incumbents have leaned on the FCC and the politicos
       to treat Title II only as a source of authority — as in, a legal
       basis for imposing a “good rule.” By their framing (and most of the
       people advocating Title II), it’s about applying a rule to ISP as a
       whole, meaning Internet information service *and* physical layer;
       and then “forbear” selectively on that bogus concept, so it’s not
       so horrible to do so. But all that’s needed is Title II on the
       physical layer. That’s why the Internet was neutral until
       2002-2005. And debating fast lanes and network management is
       misdirection. The Internet is about interoperation between networks
       — and that’s where “neutrality” arises. The problem the Internet
       solved was how to interoperate between autonomous networks. That
       is, we knew individual networks would do esoteric things within
       themselves; the problem was how to assure end users on independent
       networks would be able to interconnect across networks while
       supporting the broadest diversity of applications possible. That
       last requirement is what gave us neutrality. But it was sustained
       by having lots of networks providers who could readily enter the
       network at the physical layer. When you no longer have competitive
       access at the physical layer, all of a sudden you have a debate
       that’s about regulating traffic shaping inside individual
       intrAnets. Total confusion.

       Well said, thank you. That’s a great expansion of the point, made
       more briefly by Andy, that the real issue is lack of competition,
       not neutrality per se.
       There’s a larger question here of how legislatures and regulatory
       agencies can, in general, sustain the combination of technical
       expertise and political framing necessary to even define the
       public’s interest, let alone protect it. Internet traffic policy,
       at this point, might as well be astrophysics. The amount of
       training and experience required to even have an informed opinion
       makes public oversight difficult. We’re reduced to extremely
       general signals (“a million comments in favor of… THE INTERNET”)
       because that’s the granularity it which popular sentiment can be
       expressed.
