BREAKING: New wage-theft lawsuit filed against Hollywood giants as Techtopus
scandal grows
       By Mark Ames
       On September 8, 2014
       techtopusiimouse The Silicon Valley wage fixing story is expanding
       into Hollywood’s visual effects (VFX) industry. A new class action
       lawsuit on behalf of VFX workers just been filed in the Northern
       California District Court against the biggest names in the
       industry, including Walt Disney Animation, Dreamworks Animation,
       Sony Pictures, as well as the two original “Techtopus” conspirators
       — LucasFilm and Pixar.
       In all, the complaint names VFX nine defendants, including San
       Rafael’s Imagemovers Digital. The lawsuit is being lead by noted
       antitrust class action law firm Cohen Milstein — which recently
       settled a $450 million antitrust class action against Apple for
       fixing ebook prices.
       Brent Johnson of Cohen Milstein told PandoDaily:

     “Visual effects and animation workers are the lifeblood of many
     modern motion pictures. They take us to space, bring fairy tales to
     life, and give superheroes something to fight. In return, they
     should receive fair pay determined by competition, not Defendants’
     secret deals to suppress their wages and limit their employment
     opportunities. We plan to seek compensation for the wrongs done to
     the class.”
       As we reported earlier this year, the tentacles of the Techtopus
       wage-theft cartel spread far beyond Silicon Valley, ensnaring
       hundreds of thousands of employees across industries and oceans.
       The landmark class action lawsuit against Apple, Google, Intel and
       Adobe was confined originally to seven companies, three of which
       already settled — Intuit, and Disney subsidiaries Pixar and
       Lucasfilm.
       One arm of this wage-fixing cartel reached deep into the VFX
       industry. According to today’s class action complaint:

     Visual effects and animation companies have conspired to
     systematically suppress the wages and salaries of those who they
     claim to prize as their greatest assets—their own workers.
       The complaint (embedded below) suggests that the wage-fixing
       scandal in the VFX industry affects “thousands” of employees as
       each of the companies listed “employed hundreds or thousands of
       class members each year. The class is so numerous that individual
       joinder of all members is impracticable.”
       The complaint excludes claims against Pixar and Lucasfilm that were
       already settled in 2013. However, as the complaint notes, most tech
       workers in the special effects industry are not “salaried”
       employees, and last year’s settlement with Pixar and Lucasfilm
       involved only its salaried employees.
       Pixar head Ed Catmull boasted under oath in his deposition last
       year that he never gave contracts to his VFX employees:

     CATMULL: To be very clear, we did not — and I — we’ve been very
     clear about internally, we don’t have contracts, whereas most of the
     studios had contracts.
     Q: I’m sorry, what does that mean? Don’t have contracts?
     CATMULL: Well, most of the studios had contracts between the studio
     and the employees. Employment contracts. And I believe they were bad
     things.
       Earlier this summer, we reported on the role Dreamworks Animation —
       headed by top Obama Administration bundler, Jeffrey Katzenberg —
       appeared to have played in the illegal wage-fixing conspiracy.
       For example, in February 2004, Pixar’s then-president Ed Catmull
       emailed Steve Jobs:

     We don’t have a no raid arrangement with Sony. We have set up one
     with ILM [Lucasfilm] and Dreamworks which has worked quite well.
       According to today’s complaint, the wage-fixing agreement was
       worked out between Steve Jobs and Jeffrey Katzenberg:

     By no later than 2004 (and possibly much earlier), Steve Jobs and
     the CEO of DreamWorks Animation, Jeffrey Katzenberg, had personally
     discussed and formed similar “no raid” agreements between their
     companies. As Catmull explicitly acknowledged in an email: “we have
     an agreement with DreamWorks not to actively pursue each others
     employees.” Catmull acknowledged under oath that Jobs and Katzenberg
     discussed the subject and that the two companies weren’t “going
     after each other.”
       There’s a lot more to unpack from this complaint that I’ll get into
       soon, as well as the recent appeal filed by Google, Apple et al
       against District Court Judge Lucy Koh’s denial of that settlement.
       What makes this story so important is that this is the first time
       we know of when antitrust laws have been successfully used against
       an illegal wage-theft conspiracy. New ground is being broken in the
       suit — and workers are learning that the consequences of inequality
       and incestuous board room relationships effects everyone on the
       outside, from well-paid tech workers, to barely-secure VFX artists,
       down to the minimum wage workers who service the Valley and
       Hollywood studios.
       More soon…
