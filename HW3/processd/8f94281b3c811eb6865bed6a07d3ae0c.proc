If We Release a Small Fraction of Arctic Carbon, 'We're Fucked':
Climatologist

   This week, scientists made a disturbing discovery in the Arctic Ocean:
   They saw "vast methane plumes escaping from the seafloor," as the
   Stockholm University put it in a release disclosing the observations.
   The plume of methane—a potent greenhouse gas that traps heat more
   powerfully than carbon dioxide, the chief driver of climate
   change—was unsettling to the scientists.

   But it was even more unnerving to Dr. Jason Box, a widely published
   climatologist who had been following the expedition. As I was digging
   into the new development, I stumbled upon his tweet, which, coming from
   a scientist, was downright chilling:

     If even a small fraction of Arctic sea floor carbon is released to
     the atmosphere, we're f'd.

     — Jason Box (@climate_ice) July 29, 2014

   Box, who is currently a professor of glaciology at the Geological
   Survey of Denmark and Greenland, has been studying the Arctic for
   decades. His accolade-packed Wikipedia page notes that he's made some
   20 expeditions to the Arctic since 1994, and served as the lead author
   on the Greenland section of NOAA's State of the Climate report from
   2008-2012. He also runs the Dark Snow project and writes about the
   latest findings in the field at his blog, Meltfactor.

   In other words, Box knows the Arctic, and he knows climate change—and
   the methane plumes had him blitzed enough to bring out the F bombs.

   Now, the scientists in the Arctic didn't fully understand why the
   plumes were occurring. But they speculated that a warmer "tongue" of
   ocean current was destabilizing methane hydrates on the Arctic slope.

   I called the scientist at his office in Copenhagen, and he talked
   frankly and emphatically about the new threat, and about the specter
   of climate change in general. He also swore like a sailor, which I've
   often wondered how climatologists refrain from doing, given the urgency
   of the problem—it's certainly an entirely accurate way to communicate
   the climate plight.

   First of all, I asked Box if he stood by that tweet. He did. He'd
   revise it a bit, to include surface carbon—methane locked in the
   permafrost that's also beginning to leak out—because if we loose enough
   of either, we're in trouble.

   "Even if a small fraction of the Arctic carbon were released to the
   atmosphere, we're fucked," he told me. What alarmed him was that "the
   methane bubbles were reaching the surface. That was something new in my
   survey of methane bubbles," he said.

   The scientists' video of methane bubbles in the Arctic Ocean.

   "The conventional thought is that the bubbles would be dissolved before
   they reached the surface and that microorganisms would consume that
   methane, and that's normal," Box went on. But if the plumes are making
   it to the surface, that's a brand new source of heat-trapping gases
   that we need to worry about.

   The scientists on the expedition confirm that's what we're seeing, too:

   "We are 'sniffing' methane," Ulf Hedman, the science coordinator of the
   Swedish Polar Research Secretariat, wrote in a post highlighted by
   Climate Change SOS. "We see the bubbles on video from the camera
   mounted on the CTD or the Multicorer. All analysis tells the signs. We
   are in a Mega flare. We see it in the water column, we read it above
   the surface, and we follow it up high into the sky with radars and
   lasers. We see it mixed in the air and carried away with the winds.
   Methane in the air."

   "Methane is more than 20 times more potent than CO2 in trapping
   infrared as part of the natural greenhouse effect," Box said. "Methane
   getting to the surface—that's potent stuff."

   It's especially worrying because the Arctic is warming faster than
   nearly anywhere else on Earth. Now, along with melting sea ice and
   thawing permafrost, we have to add to our list of 'feedback
   loop' concerns that warming Arctic oceans may be releasing fonts of
   methane. That is, the warmer the ocean gets, the more methane gets
   spewed out of those stores on the continental shelf, and the warmer the
   ocean gets, ad infinitum.

I may escape a lot of this, but my daughter might not. She's 3 years old.

   "The Arctic is our most immediate carbon concern," Box continued. There
   is an immense amount of carbon stored there. "It's a giant number. But
   we should think in terms of, even if a small amount of that carbon
   comes out, that's a problem."

   Box, who hails from Colorado, relocated to Denmark in part to escape
   the impending impacts of climate change. "Droughts are going to be a
   problem for the interior states," he said. "I'm a bit of climate
   refugee." Because the Arctic methane plumes, of course, are just
   another worrying source of a global phenomenon that is rapidly
   approaching the brink of irreversibility.

   "We're on a trajectory to an unmanageable heating scenario, and we need
   to get off it," he said. "We're fucked at a certain point, right? It
   just becomes unmanageable. The climate dragon is being poked, and
   eventually the dragon becomes pissed off enough to trash the place."

   It was refreshing to hear a climatologist pull no punches, while still
   eloquently and accurately summarizing the science—even though an
   increasing number are becoming proactive, like the
   paleoclimatologist Dr. Michael Mann, and top climate scientist Dr.
   James Hansen, climate scientists are still learning how to engage the
   public in a manner that's forceful and compelling. Like Dr. Hansen, Box
   has a deeply personal reason to sound the alarm.

   "I may escape a lot of this," he said, "but my daughter might not.
   She's 3 years old." Climate change may not destabilize the globe in our
   lifetime, or even his daughter's—but the fact that feedback loops like
   methane release could rapidly accelerate the warming means that there's
   a chance rapid climate transformation—and the social and
   economic catastrophes that would likely accompany it—could strike
   sooner.

   "If you stand to lose everything, then even a low probability event is
   high-risk. That's why people fund armies—just in case they get invaded.
   We need to invest in decarbonizing our energy system." He paused, then
   added:

   "We've got to keep this fucking carbon in the ground."
