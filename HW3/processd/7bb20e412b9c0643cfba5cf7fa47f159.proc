The price is right

   Feb 20, ’14 3:26 PM
   Author asymco-admin Categories Industry, Theory

   One of the axioms of hardware business is that prices fall over time.
   The consumer price index for personal computers and peripheral
   equipment from 1998 to 2014 is shown below:

   CUUR0000SEEE01_Max_630_378

   The price index suggests that prices for computers should be 54% of
   2007 levels. Charles Arthur illustrated this on a global basis using a
   separate set of data.

     The data shows that the weighted average selling price (ASP) of a PC
     has fallen from $614.60 in the first quarter of 2010 to just $544.30
     in the third quarter of 2013, the most recent date for which data is
     available.

   The result is a chronically low margin for computer manufacturers. As
   Charles points out, the average profit for a PC is less than the price
   of a coffee at Starbucks. LG and Sony’s exits from the market are
   symptomatic of the crisis. This is not a new phenomenon. There has been
   a long series of mergers, acquisitions and exits by incumbents.

   Except of course for one incumbent.

   The Mac, aged 30, seems to soldier on. Phil Schiller noted that of its
   original competitors, Apple is the only PC maker to still be in the
   market. One could imagine that this existence is marginal, or that the
   Mac managed to survive by giving up on unit volumes or pricing.

   The following graph shows the revenue per unit for the Mac and its
   volumes.

   Screen Shot 2014-02-20 at 2.59.43 PM

   The Mac not only continues to preserve pricing but it also seems to
   grow volumes at a time of overall market decline. Going back to the
   consumer price index, the Mac in December 2007 was priced, on average,
   at $1539. In December 2014, the price was $1322, with $40 deferred.

   So rather than being 54% of December 2007 prices, the Mac is almost at
   90%.

   You’ll note that along with the Mac I also illustrate the pricing of
   Apple’s other devices. Even with the iPod, the pricing has remained
   stubbornly consistent for over 7 years. Whether the volumes are
   falling, rising rapidly or remaining flat, Apple’s product pricing
   remains predictably consistent.

   The point being that the violation of the axiomatic price erosion rule
   in PCs is not anomalous. It suggests something about the violation of
   the same rule in devices. It suggests that perhaps the company does not
   respond to the same market forces.

   But we already know that. Jony Ive told us as much:

     “We’re keenly aware that when we develop and make something and
     bring it to market that it really does speak to a set of values. And
     what preoccupies us is that sense of care, and what our products
     will not speak to is a schedule, what our products will not speak to
     is trying to respond to some corporate or competitive agenda. We’re
     very genuinely designing the best products that we can for people.”

   The result is plain to see: Caring about the product means that it can
   be priced at a point which consumers care to pay.

   Trouble is, judging by how Apple is valued, nobody believes that this
   is sustainable. Regardless of the evidence within Apple’s own history,
   it’s the exception, not the rule and the bet continues to be that they
   cannot continue to remain an exception.

   Is Apple going to continue to repeal the laws that govern its industry,
   as it has for decades, or will it, as the market expects, abide by
   them?

       the market. ”
       Other than Ive’s comment —that is surely right— Apple is (almost)
       the only company that integrated hard&soft… and volume.
       I can remember Amiga having its OS, Sun/Solaris, and other intents
       (like Be). But neither one had volume.
       I think that to do Ive’s comment a reality, Apple had to follow
       Alan Kay’s advice: “Those who loves software, own the hardware.”
       (My words from the top of my mind.)

       I sure hope they continue being the exception. Worried if the 5C
       was a sign of them trying to ‘abide by the laws of the industry.’
       What do you think?
          + StevenDrost
            Everyone is very down on the 5C, but I believe its optimizes
            their current and future strategy. They can’t sell phones made
            from the same materials, with the same features without
            cannibalizing their highend. The real test of the 5C will come
            in 18 months. Assuming that they keep it in production for 3
            years, it could be the 350$ phone that everyone predicted,
            just late.
          + stefnagel
            Failing in little ways averts failing in the big ways. Apple
            would be failing strategically, if it did not test out growth
            edges.
          + Walt French
            I think the 5C was an attempt to compete head-on with Nokia:
            high quality, good camera, but knockabout, plastic
            construction to be the SUV stablemate to the iPhone jewelbox.
            To my eyes, the implosion of that segment is one of the more
            interesting features of the recent smartphone market. Nokia
            dumped a bunch of 520′s into the market and either got the
            tail end of it, or simply trashed it.
            (If I’m wrong, and the 5C was actually meant to capture China,
            then Apple is a lot stupider than I think and it owns the
            resultant low sales more.)
               o Boltar
                 Seems pretty clear (especially I the face of rumors of
                 persistent complaints from contract manufacturers about
                 the difficulty of assembling the iPhone 5) that the 5C
                 was about a manufacturing redesign to cut fab costs.
                 Apple couldn’t have continued to make the 5 without
                 substantially smaller margins than with th 5C.
                 So I think it’s important to be specific in what you are
                 comparing the choice to build the 5C with: discontinuing
                 the 5 and offering only the 5S? Building a 5C with a
                 metal case identical to the 5S? Continuing to sell the 5
                 without design changes? Or creating a clearly
                 differentiated 2nd tier product?
               o Walt French
                 My belief was that the 5C was meant to be a
                 clearly-differentiated, but NOT 2nd-tier, product for
                 more active, younger and/or less formal-identifying
                 users.
                 I believe it was meant to broaden the range of people
                 Apple could appeal to strongly. I.e., it allowed Apple to
                 make the 5S even more precious/jewel-like, which some
                 love while others disdain…have a hard time relating to.
                 Yes, a lower price would be part of that mix, but if you
                 use my SUV analogy, you’ll note that many brands price
                 the SUVs above their better sedans.
                 Ideally, the 5C would’ve gone to users who didn’t
                 previously buy at the 5S level of price. But
                 realistically, Apple would’ve been happy for more users
                 to have switched to the 5C, and anticipated as much. In
                 any case, the assembly costs are a tiny fraction of the
                 sales prices and much less than the price difference
                 between the two models; fab costs must be quite secondary
                 to producing the product that its customers want to buy.
                 Which, unsurprisingly, is pretty much what Apple has
                 said, repeatedly.
               o Sacto_Joe
                 I tend to agree wih Boltar. Apple encountered a real
                 problem with production of the aluminum-cased iPhone. As
                 recently as last quarter we saw them run up against that
                 limitation. The 4 and 4S were far more capable of growing
                 production capacity. In effect, Apple got backed into a
                 corner with the aluminum housing.
                 I think Apple is encountering a similar problem with the
                 iPad: The aluminum enclosure is resisting scaling up,
                 production-wise, since iPads need to compete with iPhones
                 for machine time.
                 The plastic enclosure isn’t a bad idea, but it definitely
                 needs to drop down to a lower price tier to truly be
                 effective. Even there, it’s a question whether it isn’t
                 wiser to create yet a fourth tier and keep the 4S around.
                 I’d also create a second tier plastic iPad ASAP, maybe
                 even mid-fiscal year. That will allow aluminum iPhone
                 production to increase in the Fall.
                 Longer term, perhaps Apple can return to the 4/4S
                 approach, but with saphire front and back. Now THAT would
                 be a real gem!

            If you think apple’s phones as luxury goods you can understand
            the 5c fate.
            The old iPhone model is as luxury as the new one, it is only
            an older model the owner will change in due time, but the
            taste of the owner of an older model is the same as the owner
            of the new model, they only bought the iPhone in different
            times.
            The 5C is not the best model and you have bought is now that
            the 5S is available, so your taste for luxury is somewhat
            inferior. Buying a 5 today would not convey the same
            information about the owner than buying a 5C.
               o Sacto_Joe
                 The flaw in this reasoning is in thinking that Apple is
                 targeting the luxury market. Theyn aren’t, except
                 incidentally: They are targeting the quality market. Huge
                 difference.
                 The 5C is a high quality device, irregardless of the
                 purposefully created misperceptions being floated by
                 Apple’s enemies. And over time, it will be seen as what
                 it is; a lower priced yet still high quality entry device
                 into the Apple ecosystem. Next year, the 5SC will have
                 all the capability of the 5S at a substantially lower
                 price. I expect it will sell like crazy.
               o Space Gorilla
                 My teenage daughter had a choice between the 5S and the
                 5C, and chose the 5C. The 5C is more than good enough and
                 she likes the look and feel of it more, and doesn’t care
                 about the higher end features on the 5S.

       “The result is plain to see: Caring about the product means….”
       In part it means building products that ultimately polarizes
       consumers and Wall Street. It means a pattern of growth that
       doesn’t follow the same pattern of its peers.
       Apple’s refusal – overt or otherwise – to cow-tow is received by
       the market as dumb luck when the graph spikes upwards or
       anti-capitalistic when the same graph flattens out briefly (see
       demands to sell low-market products in every category to “fix” the
       all of Apple’s supposed problems). The sure sign of iDoom occurs
       when the graph turns downward for a quarter. The Macintosh is the
       poster child here, with its track record of out selling PCs in 30
       of 31 previous quarters.
       Meanwhile, Apple turns in a seemingly unattended masterclass
       quarter after quarter by shipping a increasing numbers of product
       driven by values wholly _different_ from its competition. Were
       Apple building cars or handbags (say Porsche or Hermes, for
       example) I assume the company would not be the target of so much
       skepticism. But my question after being an Apple customer since ’86
       remains, why does Apple piss people off so much?
          + Space Gorilla
            Exactly. I think Apple pisses off the tech industry generally
            because most in the industry believe Apple is ‘doing it
            wrong’. And yet Apple is succeeding. How!? How can this be
            happening!?! Apple was supposed to be gone by now!!!!! It’s
            very upsetting to be wrong and not understand why. This is why
            we get a lot of magical thinking when it comes to explanations
            of Apple’s success, such as luck, trickery, dumb customers,
            marketing, fashion trends, elitism, and so on. Anything but
            admit that Apple has earned its success.
     * http://www.isophist.com/ Emilio Orione
       Luxury objects follow the same price pattern of apple’s products,
       their price remain the same.
       Apple has consumerized luxury.
       I can not see how that could not be sustainable, luxury items have
       a long history and great time is needed to change a brand
       perception together with a lot of wrong products that I can’t see
       apple doing.
          + StevenDrost
            Maybe, but the counter point the that argument is that a
            Blackberry was seen as a luxury item at one point.
               o Walt French
                 At one point a BlackBerry was surely the best
                 communication tool for people who valued timely, secure
                 communications, such as Wall Street types. Certainly many
                 were acquired by wannabes who hoped to signal that they
                 were in that elite set, but mostly, they were the right
                 tool for the job.
                 Usually when we say “luxury good,” we mean something that
                 is inessential. That’s not the BB story.
               o handleym
                 Which is why, in MY opinion, the worrying signs around
                 Apple have nothing to do with what people usually natter
                 about.
                 They have to do with the persistent problems with iCloud
                 (which appear to have been fixed, but it’s difficult to
                 tell because so many developers were so burned) and
                 Apple’s weak bench in machine learning.
                 Apple can charge more because they are (more or less) the
                 best tool for the job. That changes if what the
                 competition is offering may not look as nice and may have
                 a clumsier UI, BUT it has contextual computing nailed,
                 can do real-time translation in your ear, can scan your
                 emails to remind you of things you should have done (or
                 should not have included in the mail), etc etc.
                 Maps was a harbinger. Apple managed to recover from that
                 (after some stumbling) but Maps is only the start. And
                 maps shows the point. No matter how much you love your
                 iPhone, if it didn’t have Maps (in any form — no app, not
                 even a clumsy web interface) would that make you switch
                 to Android? It probably would make me switch.
                 Contextual computing (in all its many forms) is the next
                 Maps. Now, Translate, Goggles, these are all fragments of
                 what we will expect from our future devices, and in all
                 of them Apple is weak to non-existent.
               o Walt French
                 Apple may be weak to non-existent on many services, but
                 of course many of them (today’s Exhibit A: WhatsApp) were
                 developed on Apple devices and Apple has learned how to
                 integrate them into their ecosystem rather nicely.
                 I also like your Maps example. Surely Apple, even in its
                 most full-of-BS moments, could not have thought that a
                 function that Nokia bought for a few billion, could be
                 duplicated with a couple dozen man-years and some
                 3rd-party data suppliers. More likely, in what was less
                 than their most glorious hour, they predicted pretty near
                 exactly what actually happened: users stayed with
                 iPhones’ weaker offering long enough for the worst of the
                 V1.0 kinks to get worked out. IOW, Maps is not the killer
                 app for many users, while other measures of quality,
                 privacy and support continue to favor Cupertino.
                 Meanwhile, Apple’s obvious show of power didn’t go
                 unnoticed in Mountain View; these days stock Android
                 appears to bump up against fewer of the Apple-claimed UX
                 features and Android’s rapid ascent worldwide has not
                 been matched by its market share in the wealthiest
                 markets where both Apple and Google derive the great bulk
                 of their income.
               o http://www.isophist.com/ Emilio Orione
                 Map was an operation made for developers more than end
                 users.
                 The end user map started weak and improved over time and
                 now is good enough to compete with other solutions.
                 if not for developers apple could have wait more to issue
                 a solution already good enough instead of rushing out the
                 first incomplete iteration.
                 But developers needed the possibility to insert maps in
                 their apps and with google maps they couldn’t do that
                 anymore.
                 Empowering developers it the secret for a first on iOS
                 ecosystem and the ecosystem give the advantage of Apple’s
                 devices against competitors.
          + Antti Vanhanen
            IMO Apple’s products are premium products, not luxury
            products.
               o Sacto_Joe
                 Yes. Apple focuses on the highest quality, not the
                 highest luxury. So many people miss this crucial
                 difference.
               o http://info-tran.com/ Info Dave
                 Some might say, the best value.
               o Sacto_Joe
                 Premium products, quality products, high value products.
                 I think we’re all talking about the same thing. But
                 luxury products? I think of a luxury product as being,
                 say, a mink-lined, gold-plated toilet. If Apple were
                 making toilets, they’d be made to last and to do lots of
                 useful things. If plating them gold or putting mink on
                 the toilet seat helped them do that, I suppose they
                 would. Otherwise not.
                 Case in point: The gold-colored iPhone. A true luxury
                 iPhone wouldn’t be colored gold, it’d be made out of
                 gold, or at least gold-plated.
               o http://www.isophist.com/ Emilio Orione
                 That’s not what luxury is about, it is a feeling more
                 than a price, furthermore the iPhone ASP is double of
                 samsung ASP, it does not have to be real gold to have an
                 higher price point from the competitors so to be a
                 luxury.
               o Kizedek
                 Well, my feeling is that Android (and Windows) users
                 appear to (believe they) have the luxuries of both time
                 and ideals. I can’t afford either.
                 My time is worth something: I can’t bother to manage the
                 computer, nor deal with getting the best out of it; or
                 imagine that I will want to make some kind of hobby of it
                 at the end of the day.
                 And I can’t be so idealistic that the mere idea of
                 choosing one poor product simply because there are
                 thousands of poor products to choose from on the same
                 “open” or “customizable” platform should be any kind of
                 incentive for me.
                 Have some jobs to be done, weigh the up-front cost with
                 time and TCO, and choose the best tool. Done. Quality +
                 productivity = high-value. The only “luxury” involved is
                 peace of mind.
                 “Luxuries”: Peace of mind (underrated) vs. Time
                 (non-existent) and Idealism (overrated).

                 As I have said above, luxury is not a matter of price, it
                 is a feeling. From dictionary Luxury: a state of great
                 confort and elegance.
                 Usually it is associated or come with high price, but it
                 is not mandatory, it is a feeling some objects,
                 experiences, have and some have not.
                 If the object is felt as a luxury price is maintained
                 over time much more easily.
               o Kizedek
                 OK. The post I commented on was one long sentence that
                 was unclear to me, particularly with the “furthermore”
                 clause.
               o Sacto_Joe
                 The issue isn’t whether or not some people see Apple
                 products as luxuries – some people see toilet paper as a
                 luxury. The issue is what is the market Apple is aiming
                 at? It’s not the luxury market; it’s the best computer
                 solution market. Apple wants to make computers for and
                 sell computers to people who want the best computer
                 solution they can afford.
               o charly
                 Apple has too often priorities style over substance for
                 that to be believable. How often didn’t they use to
                 little cooling because that would crimp their style or
                 made their software less easy to use because it made it
                 look cooler.
                 Apple is a luxury brand
               o sorry
                 “How often didn’t they use to little cooling because that
                 would crimp their style or made their software less easy
                 to use because it made it look cooler.”
                 I have no idea what this sentence could possibly be
                 trying to say. Sorry.
               o http://www.isophist.com/ Emilio Orione
                 But aiming at best they also succeed in having the
                 feeling of great experience and elegance usually
                 associated with luxury in products made for a big market
                 and not a niche, they have commoditized luxury and the
                 ASP of their product stay high over time like no others
                 (except luxury items of course).
               o http://www.isophist.com/ Emilio Orione
                 From the dictionary
                 Luxury: a state of great confort and elegance
                 Premium: an amount to be paid …
                 I don’t see Apple’s product as premium, that is an old
                 song about the apple’s cost, a markup put on less valued
                 products.
                 It is not so. The 27″ iMac cost less than competitor’s
                 equivalent solution, the iPad air is unmatched in price
                 by competitors, even without considering TCO, and on and
                 on.
                 Apple management of the supply chain can deliver quality
                 products at competitive price mostly unmatched by
                 competitors, more so if you consider TCO.
                 But Apple products are luxury items because the user
                 experience is the one associated with luxury, they are
                 elegant and comfortable and they convey the sense of
                 owning something peculiar apart from other products.
               o Glaurung-Quena
                 Premium vs luxury — actually it’s both, I think.
                 Obviously Apple has created an air of brand cachet, of
                 coolness about their products.
                 At the same time, they are very careful to make all their
                 products be premium machines with high end
                 specifications. For instance, aside from special
                 educational i3 imacs, they don’t make
                 any computers with celeron, pentium, or i3 processors.
                 IIRC, except for their smallest form factor machines, all
                 of their computers are equipped with at least quad core
                 processors. Likewise, they’ve
                 transitioned away from putting SATA ssd’s in their
                 machines in favor of
                 PCIe ssds.
                 I think a third strand to how they’ve kept the price of
                 their computers from collapsing the way the rest of the
                 industry has, is uniqueness — they don’t make generic
                 computers. Instead of beige desktops, they make NUC-style
                 nanocomputers, all-in-ones, and professional
                 workstations, all of which command a price premium
                 compared to regular tower desktops. The last few years
                 they’ve been doubling down on the uniqueness aspect —
                 their workstation used to *look* like a generic tower
                 desktop, now it doesn’t. Their laptops used to be unique
                 only if you did a comparison of specs, now they’ve
                 transitioned them to be all about ultraportability, with
                 your choice of extremely thin & light or slightly heavier
                 but much more powerful with an ultra-high resolution
                 display.
               o Jasper
                 Actually, very few Apple machines have high cores counts.
                 On the Mini, the Good is dual, Better is quad. On the
                 MacBooks, Airs and 13″ Pros are dual, 15″ are quads. On
                 the iMacs I think they’re all quad, not sure. iPads and
                 iPhones are all dual core machines to the competition’s
                 universally quad or even octa-core (marketing-eight, but
                 still) offerings, and even moved to dual core relatively
                 late.

            Another point is that the price of luxury isn’t that high. If
            it only costs $1000 to own a luxury item like an Apple
            computer, then that’s not much of a price considering what you
            get from it. The relative price of owning an Apple product has
            gone down as the basic price has remained fairly steady, in
            part because of inflation and in part because people are
            willing to stretch to $1000 dollars for what they perceive as
            value. And even if they can’t afford that stretch, they can
            now buy a first class iPad for that price. It isn’t that much
            of a luxury in users’ day to day lives. It’s a reasonable
            price for what they get and they know they are getting the
            best. So why settle for a cheaper, less capable non-luxury
            version?
               o Sacto_Joe
                 Yes. I bought my first Mac in 1984. The Mac plus a dot
                 matrix printer cost me more than $3,000, and that was
                 1984 dollars. I got exactly two programs for that price,
                 MacWrite and MacPaint. How many iPad Mini’s could I buy
                 for the same amount in 2014 dollars? And how vastly more
                 useful is an iPad Mini? And yet – that $3,000 was the
                 best bargain I’ve ever made.
               o Space Gorilla
                 I’m in the same boat, bought the first Mac that came out
                 in 1984 along with a printer. In Canada that was closer
                 to $5,000 as I remember it. Canadian dollar must have
                 been low in the 80s. But I used that Mac until 1992. I
                 still have it, sitting two feet away from me on my desk.
               o Kizedek
                 Same here. Kinda wish I had bought 2000 shares of Apple
                 instead. I think the shares have split three times since
                 then.

       John Huenefeld, who wrote the book on book publishing, gave our
       little company his best advice first: “Do a great book and charge

       anything else, rhetorically speaking?

            There is one small thing: doing great is really really hard.
            If you just look for greatness and copy it quickly, like
            samsung and google did, you can have a discrete chunk of money
            with a lot less effort.
            There will always be creators and copiers, I for one prefer to
            be a creator but money is the ultimate award not feeling.

       If Steve Jobs did manage to codify the culture that sustains
       Apple’s approach to product development, they will continue to have
       success.
       Some consumers are willing to pay more for a truly well designed,
       well made product. Apple is capturing this part of the markets they
       compete in. I don’t think that Apple’s culture would allow them to
       be effective competing only for market share based on price.

       A computer’s average selling price would be even lower if Macs were
       removed from the mix.
          + charly
            IIRC average selling price of PC’s is lower than the cheapest
            Mac so you are more than right
     * Henry
       I assume the first graph is for a constant-quality computer (e.g.,
       constant CPU). If so, then the curve for Mac would show a similar
       steeply decreasing pattern.
       It’s a great post regardless, but that first graph is a bit
       misleading.
          + Mark Jones
            I doubt the first graph is for a constant-quality computer. If
            it was, the curve would be much, much steeper. It’s much more
            likely to simply be total PC revenue divided by total PC units
            sold in the US.
               o Henry
                 Your explanation would imply that PC prices (per unit)
                 have fallen over 95% since 1998, and that PCs today cost
                 about $25. That obviously doesn’t make sense.
                 My understanding is BLS uses constant quality, and CPI
                 calculations are based on constant quality.
                 This would be easy enough to look up on the BLS website
                 for someone who cares enough to look it up.
               o Walt French
                 Pretty easy to visit, yes. But the actual description is
                 complicated.
                 So here’s a very crude SWAG: a 1998 IBM announcement has
                 a 233 MHz Pentium II “priced at just $1,099” and
                 featuring “16 MB of SDRAM, and a 2.5 GB hard drive.” That
                 machine would of course be unsalable today; today’s
                 top-of-the-line MacBookPro might have 16GB (1000X) of
                 memory and 1TB (400X) of much faster SSD storage, with
                 maybe 50X the CPU throughput. Call it maybe 80X overall
                 versus the nearly $4000 for the BTO being 4X the price,
                 and you get pretty close to a price index 5% (4X/80X) of
                 the 1998 cost for similar performance.
                 (Imperfect, in that the MacBook includes a first-class
                 display, which the IBM did not, the keyboard is NOT 50X
                 better, GPUs, yada yada.)
               o handleym
                 Henry is essentially correct. The first graph, while
                 interesting, detracts from the rest of the post by
                 confusing the issue.
                 It IS true that the price of computing (and related
                 issues like data storage,communication, even printing)
                 have fallen astonishingly, and continue to fall, but that
                 is an orthogonal issue to the fact that the PC market has
                 become commoditized.
                 If you’re going to link the two, I think you have to
                 spell out the link, because it’s not quite obvious.
                 Perhaps the fact that computing is not just so cheap, but
                 that most of us have all the compute we need is the link
                 — ten years ago many of us were willing to pay the extra
                 costs of the high end model (of any brand) because it
                 delivered value we needed; now most consumers don’t care
                 whether their laptop has a dual core i3 or a quad-core
                 AMD — either way they know it’s good enough, so just look
                 at the price.
                 The real story here is commodification, not the lower
                 price of digital items.
                 Airline tickets in the US, for example, are a commodity
                 and have been subject to the same dynamic.
                 Autos represent the path that might have been —
                 superficially a commodity, but the companies involved
                 have done enough around various more-or-less intangible
                 issues (branding, image, differentiation that may be
                 superficial but is not completely worthless).
                 PCs might have gone down this path (as a simple example
                 charging a little more for crapware free, sticker free
                 PC, or “we’re the one-and-only laptop company that sells
                 you a trackpad that isn’t complete crap”) but none of
                 them did. I’m not sure why. Maybe business sales were not
                 receptive to the idea? Maybe MS and Intel between them
                 had too much ability to force certain (in retrospect
                 stupid) ideas like “you only get sticker money if you put
                 the stickers on EVERY PC you ship”. Maybe the problem is
                 that, pretty much from the day the 386 shipped, the PC
                 vendors (like airlines, but not as mych like auto
                 manufacturers) really WERE just what we think of them as
                 today — engineering-free, IP-free assemblers with no
                 value-add whatsoever, undeserving of any profit because
                 they don’t do anything of real value? (That’s what
                 happens when you have someone else doing all the hard
                 parts…)
                 Relevance to today?
                 ARM, Qualcomm, Broadcomm and Google are doing all the
                 hard parts… HTC, Nokia, etc are doing very little that
                 provide value customers care about. Samsung has managed
                 to be king of this particular commodity, but with a very
                 tenuous grip, and with little evidence that THEY can
                 provide additional value customers are willing to pay
                 for. (Samsung does some parts of the hard stuff — eg the
                 IC manufacturing — internally, which gives them some
                 advantage, but until they have their own OS or their CPU
                 design they’re still basically in the commodity game.)
                 I see no reason why Acer selling a me-too tablet, or
                 Lenovo selling some weird Android+Windows hybrid is going
                 to change any of this dynamic. They’re all still selling
                 commodity products with NOTHING about them that makes a
                 customer willing to pay 10% more.
               o Walt French
                 As I note above, the BLS attempts to measure the cost of
                 consumer computers and peripherals in the index, to
                 report the relative cost of home computing over time, for
                 a fixed quality level.
                 They track maybe hundreds of attributes and attempt to
                 bridge them at three different quality levels, working
                 with models that change every few months (while old
                 models stay on sale at higher prices, obscuring actual
                 cuts). Yes, complicated. At least they don’t use the
                 “hedonic” approach that would drown in the mess of data.
                 Your notes about the industry are interesting. Maybe 5
                 years ago, many believed that Intel had the CPU wars won,
                 thanks to the billions of expense to fab at the next
                 smaller geometry. The huge volumes in smartphones, which
                 weren’t as performance sensitive, did the classic
                 disruption thing, and now Intel finds itself competing
                 with firms that have been able to finance their own
                 expertise with high volumes of cheap parts.
                 And I’ll pile on a gratuitous shot at Samsung: not only
                 do they need a differentiator; it needs to be perceived
                 as more attractive. With Android OS costs trending pretty
                 close to $0.00, we’re talking software features that
                 Samsung has pretty spectacularly failed at impressing
                 with.

                 Except for the extortion payments being made to Microsoft
                 to avoid a patent infringement lawsuit. :-)
               o Walt French
                 Oh, OK, the OS for a phone might be $10 per unit for a
                 few more years until the curtain drops on the patents’
                 17–20 year lives.
                 My impression is that the strongest patents that
                 Microsoft has asserted are already over a decade old.
                 Doesn’t look like a growth industry for Microsoft. Nor
                 would an alternative be a source of competitive
                 differentiation, since the MS patents are very
                 fundamental to OS’s.
                 Which was the point that the economic incentive to an
                 alternative is near zero. As Google says, they’ve leveled
                 the playing field, albeit leaving Apple some premium UX
                 features.
               o http://info-tran.com/ Info Dave
                 My impression is that this is nothing more than saber
                 rattling on the part of Microsoft, in a legal sense. So
                 far, Samsung is the only company that may gain by going
                 to war. And so far, Samsung has declined to rattle.
                 This was a desperate move on Microsoft’s part, that so
                 far, has paid off.
                 p.s. I agree with everything you said.
               o Walt French
                 Most patents are licensed but when there’s a sharp shift
                 in participants, it takes a while for the pecking order
                 to get r-established. So when the iPhone showed up on the
                 scene, we saw headlines about Nokia v Apple, etc.; those
                 have faded.
                 Google and the Android partnership companies remain in
                 the headlines, in part because those companies compete in
                 nations with strong Intellectual Property regimes (the US
                 and EU, especially), but also in weak-IP-rule countries
                 such as India and China. You can’t compete well if you
                 lack features in the strong nations (where most of the
                 ASP and profit is) and you can’t compete in the weak-IP
                 nations (where the volume is) if you’re paying $40 more
                 per handset for IP. These are existential issues so the
                 fight goes on.
                 Regards Microsoft, Motorola is the sole Android® partner
                 that has NOT seen the logic of settling with Microsoft;
                 others went the licensing route. Especially inasmuch as
                 Lenovo is a (the?) major Windows OEM, I imagine the Moto
                 settlement will come soon enough, too.
               o http://www.laugh-eat.com/ kyron

       Great post! Is making me rethink whether Apple needs to sell a more
       affordable version of the iPhone (a la Christensen). Apple seems to
       be making a deliberate choice to avoid the “loser’s game” of price
       driven competition, which often seems like the net outcome of
       following Christensen’s advice to the letter.
       It reminds me of the following quote from Benjamin Graham: “You can
       get in way more trouble with a good idea than a bad idea,
       because you forget the good idea has limits.” Apple’s first
       priority is making great products that consumers value. They can
       make these products affordable without following the low end herd
       and diving into blood red competitive waters. From a long term
       strategic standpoint, it makes little sense for Apple to copy the
       behavior of its competitors, as your post demonstrates.
       A company’s goal should be a unique strategy that other companies
       can’t match — herd-like behavior is contrary to the goal of a
       unique, hard to match strategy in which priorities, processes, and
       resources fit well together (a la Christensen and Michael Porter).
       If Apple is going to grow, then it’s going to be through new
       products like the “health maintenance” watch you mentioned in one
       of your recent podcasts. These kind of complementary products
       enhance Apple’s bundling strategy, and will drive sales growth in
       existing products like the iPhone (just like the iPhone has helped
       drive growth in Mac sales).
          + Sacto_Joe
            “If Apple is going to grow, then it’s going to be through new
            products…”
            The other point to recall is that Apple isn’t interested in
            growing itself for the sake of growth. I personally suspect
            that to be the real reason the market isn’t giving AAPL the
            valuation it deserves. If a company isn’t perceived to be
            interested in huge ROI’s, then it’s stock is punished.
            What’s interesting with Apple is that, because of its ability
            to make lateral, disruptive moves, it can in fact engender
            huge boosts in growth, thus continually surprising the market.
            But it must always be remembered that such growth spurts are
            in effect a secondary reaction, and never Apple’s primary
            focus.
               o Accent_Sweden
                 While I like and agree with much of what you say, I think
                 we have to accept that the growth spurt of the iPhone is
                 not a secondary reaction. Everything that grows off that
                 could be argued to be secondary reactions. The iPhone was
                 the gateway drug to most non-Apple users, before that the
                 iPod. The secondary reactions are seen in the additional
                 Macs, MacBook, AppleTVs and so on sold. The iPad is
                 somewhere in between. Established Apple customers jumped
                 on it but it is bringing even more new people onboard.
               o Sacto_Joe
                 Every new product becomes a “gateway” to the rest of
                 Apple’s products, I agree. But I think you’re missing my
                 point. None of these products was developed with the
                 original intent of acquiring growth or creating a growth
                 spurt. They were developed to please people, period.
                 “We’re very genuinely designing the best products that we
                 can for people.” That is simply not good enough for the
                 Market. They want growth. They view the “worth” of a
                 company in terms of worth to shareholders, and more
                 specifically worth to shareholders NOW.
               o http://ValuingDisruption.com/ Bill Esbenshade
                 Michael Porter has some great writings to the effect that
                 companies shouldn’t trade away a unique, highly
                 profitable strategic approach in the pursuit of growth,
                 since by doing so they give up the strategic advantages
                 that led to the company’s original and ongoing success.
                 Porter says this happens slowly, over time, leading to
                 more and more industry homogeneity and direct
                 competition. In this scenario, companies in an industry
                 end up competing based solely on operational
                 effectiveness, leading to price wars and declining
                 margins. The point is that companies should preserve
                 their unique strategies and pursue organic, sustainable
                 growth.
               o Sacto_Joe
                 “Yet Apple has a trailing PE of 13.” Apple has low growth
                 prospects as things presently stand, and this is a market
                 fixated with ROI. Here’s what I said on Braeburn Group
                 recently:
                 “Today’s Market is beguiled by huge ROI’s. If a stock
                 doesn’t appear to be able to provide it, the Market isn’t
                 interested…[but] the Market, when it becomes irrational,
                 loses the ability to separate wheat from chaff. Huge bets
                 are placed on the chaff, forcing it up out of all reason.
                 Meanwhile, boring old wheat languishes, because there’s
                 no perception of a [potential] large ROI there.
                 That’s all fine and dandy, until the chaff gets blown
                 away in the wind of reality, and only the wheat
                 remains…Between two and three months from now, we’re
                 going to see the wind of reality again make itself known,
                 with more chaff getting blown away. Those who have either
                 been nimble or have invested in wheat will be
                 vindicated.”
                 I should have added “or lucky”, because that’s the real
                 driver of today’s irrational market; the chance that
                 you’ll get lucky, beat the odds, and strike it rich….
          + Walt French
            “If Apple is going to grow, then it’s going to be through new
            products…”
            Bring ‘em on!
            But let’s first remember that Apple’s past success is all
            about not being the first kid on the block with a music player
            or computerphone or tablet; that success came from recognizing
            a set of customers with identifiable needs, and selling a
            product that those customers found good enough that they
            didn’t need to bother putting the pieces together to make a
            superior solution.
            The 5C, for instance, could have been such a product, a more
            knockabout stablemate for young/hip consumers in wealthy
            markets, to complement the 5S jewelry. Nobody seems to think
            the 5C was a new product, however… just a day-late,
            dollar-short variant on a 6-year-old line. I don’t see how it
            could ever have competed against the no-IP, 2G devices in
            India and other low-income, IP-lite nations, so doubt that it
            was ever so intended. More likely, in another year or two the
            C line, with perhaps another $100 or $200 savings against the
            top of the line, could look pretty good against whatever
            Samsung fields in the price range. It may yet be such a
            product.
            PS: in the next few months, Google is rumored to perform a
            substantial revamp to the low-level mechanism that Android
            uses to run programs, and while I expect there’ll be backward
            compatibility, the best performance and features could require
            notably different hardware and drivers that will tax the
            weaker OHA partners. Raising the bar on support could be
            helpful for its partners countering the open-source
            Android-like firms and could even change the relationship
            between fully-licensed Android® and the open-source. This
            could significantly shift the economics in countries that now
            find older-version Android phones good enough.
               o http://ValuingDisruption.com/ Bill Esbenshade
                 Thanks for response Walt! It made me think of one other
                 relevant point. While I do believe Apple can grow and
                 deepen its strategic advantage through new integrated
                 devices, Porter notes that the pursuit of global growth
                 is a great way for a company to continue growing in a
                 sustainable way without sacrificing a unique strategy.
                 Apple is pursuing this exact strategy, pushing its
                 devices and iTunes/App Store ecosystem all over the
                 world. And unlike Google, Facebook, etc., Apple is only
                 making acquisitions that enhance its integrated
                 hardware/software products (e.g., AuthenTec, the GT
                 Global sapphire deal, the recently announced TestFlight
                 deal, etc.). Apple is using acquisitions to deepen its
                 strategy of hard to match, integrated hardware/software
                 products.
                 Contrast these acquisitions with the almost incoherent,
                 defensive, and market share dominance based acquisitions
                 of Facebook and Google. If you don’t have a unique, hard
                 to match strategy, just buy up everything and go for
                 market share dominance (hoping you don’t end up in a
                 futile, whack a mole effort involving endless
                 acquisitions of small, overpriced, but potentially
                 threatening competitors).
          + http://www.asymco.com Horace Dediu
            The problem with a strategy that simply states that “low end
            is good” is that it does not account for the size of that
            market. I’m not sure that having on the order of a billion
            customers can qualify someone as being “high end” and thus
            doomed to disruption simply because those billion users are at
            the top of income brackets. Disruption theory is more than a
            simple dichotomy of “high” and “low”. It defines the vertical
            scale as the basis of competition, not simply on the basis of
            price or arbitrary performance.
               o http://ValuingDisruption.com/ Bill Esbenshade
                 Thanks for response Horace, and for the outstanding work!
                 It seems like where you are on that vertical scale
                 depends, to a large degree, on the distinctiveness of
                 your strategy. Apple’s at the high end because it has a
                 unique, hard to duplicate strategy that leads to highly
                 differentiated products. Android and AOSP phones are at
                 the low end because they don’t have a unique strategy, so
                 they’re subject to direct industry rivalry, price driven
                 competition, and/or exorbitant advertising expenses (a la
                 Michael Porter). It’s interesting that a notable
                 exception to this brutal price-cutting may be Xiaomi,
                 precisely because it does have a unique strategy that no
                 one else is following.

            “Apple seems to be making a deliberate choice to avoid the

            they are largely because of the lie that are subsidized

            Apple could sell every one of their products for 1/2 the price
            and every employee would be paid just as well. The company
            would be healthy and robust. Etc. But they don’t because they

                 They obviously couldn’t because their net margin is not
                 50%. Unless you mean until their cash ran out, in which
                 case they could easily give away every one of their
                 products, by the same argument.
               o bluger
                 Apple’s margin on both the iPad and iPhone is greater
                 than 50%. Their corporate margin drops as a result of
                 other less lucrative ventures, such as the desktop and
                 laptop lines — very profitable compared to say Dell, but
                 more traditional compared to the incredible profits of
                 the iPhone/iPad.
               o netmargin
                 You don’t really understand what gross margin is at all,

                 Ah the ol’ innuendo reply. So clever but completely
                 vacuous.
               o netmargin
                 They could not sell the current iPhones solely at half
                 price without losing money, because even if the gross
                 margin is > 50%, the net margin isn’t, even with all the
                 other businesses somehow spun off. And the gross margin
                 of the iPad, as irrelevant as it is, is not 50% at all.

                 also choose features such as a larger size.) This chart
                 plainly shows the quick decline in prices in the earlier
                 years (up to -35% per year early on!) and the
                 reaccelerating of declines since 2010, but still only in
                 the range of -7% – -10%. I got those numbers from the
                 data download option, but they are visible in the log
                 chart, which they are NOT in the linear chart.
                 BTW, the BLS page on the computer CPI shows how
                 heroically they struggle to find what consumers are
                 paying for a given level of quality, when quality is so
                 sharply improving. And it’s important to note that the
                 index displayed is for computers and peripherals that
                 consumers spend their dollars on; printers, CD readers
                 and the like all are all somehow included.
                 The linear scale chart appears (to me) to emphasize only
                 the single fact of computers’ price reductions over the
                 last 15 years, with the caveat I gave above. That’s
                 hardly news. The log scale shows the drop, plus makes
                 visible:
                 • over the range, prices have dropped to about 5% of
                 their early value
                 • rapid declines early; recent declines at only 1/3 the
                 earlier rate
                 • a pause around 2010, perhaps from reduced capex in the
                 2009 timeframe.
                 • specific declines are easier to pick off: in the last 7
                 years prices have dropped by about half; in the prior 5
                 years they’d dropped about the same amount.
                 Maybe the things you can see in the log chart aren’t
                 helpful, but I’d think anybody who cares about the chart
                 would want the extras I can see, and I invite responses
                 as to what facts are both important today and more
                 visible, in the linear chart.

                 The Manufacturers may finally be getting a break in price
                 drops because Moore’s Law is no longer ruling the roost.
                 The factor not included in the data is the lack of
                 increase in processor speeds since those are limited by
                 frequency. If you were graphing the quality of the
                 transistor per dollar, rather than the price per
                 “machine” you would have seen a very different story.
                 Customers are no longer buying machines that offer a
                 compelling improvement in processing speed. A 4 year old
                 computer today is now more analogous to a 4 year old TV
                 rather than a 4 year old computer from 1999. The power
                 envelope is the limiting factor not the geometry that
                 drove the earlier heyday of Moore’s Law. One result of
                 this is low powered devices were not limited by the same
                 problems and actually were able to ramp frequency while
                 computer’s could not. A cell phone now offers much of the
                 functionality of a $400 computer. Sales of traditional
                 computer’s will continue to drop because the product
                 turnover is dropping, and there is more competition from
                 other kinds of devices. Dropping demand for computer’s
                 definitely means there is less investment money to pay
                 for the next processor node.
                 What I am curious about is why has the obvious slow down
                 in increases of computer speeds been so ignored by the
                 press? There has been more technology innovation than in
                 the 90’s, but we have seen less growth in productivity.
                 Perhaps if we could name the problem, the solution would
                 get more attention. Two types of processors have
                 continued to improve while CPU’s of average PC’s have
                 stagnated. One is the graphics processor because of it’s
                 ability to harness more improvement from running multiple
                 cores, and the other is the low power computing devices.
                 Area’s economic productivity have followed in the wake of
                 each of these two exceptions. Petroleum exploration has
                 benefited from the ability to find oil that was not
                 practical to extract because this is processed with
                 multicore machines with large graphics processors. Cell
                 phones are another growth area with smart phones leading
                 the way towards new business innovation. Apple’s big bet
                 on ARM makes much more sense if we look at what happened
                 to the 5th generation PowerPC chip and how it failed to
                 match the growth in processor speeds that Intel was
                 producing.
               o Walt French
                 I don’t buy a couple of your points.
                 First, the tech press has been on the speed/power
                 tradeoff at least since maybe 2009, when it was obvious
                 that a huge market for smartphones existed, that
                 Chipzilla was ill-equipped to serve.
                 Second, you need to be careful about measuring a chip
                 purely by clock speed. Jobs that can exploit multiple
                 cores well (and of challenging uses, that’s about all of
                 ‘em) get big advantages from multi-core solutions, even
                 with clock-speed untouched. And within a given core,
                 architectural improvements mean some tasks that formerly
                 took 8 clock cycles might now process in 6, or a given
                 core can have more operations in flight in parallel.
                 Realistic workload metrics capture this.
                 What you ARE seeing is that consumer functions don’t need
                 the superchips to be able to work very well. I
                 occasionally note less-than-zippy response on this
                 4-year-old laptop, but realistically I doubt it costs me
                 a minute a day. Maybe when I get my whizbang analytical
                 method going against some test files, then I’ll spring
                 for a more capable device.
                 Oh, a PS: I refuted your assertion as if it meant a
                 steady increase in clock speed, but as I’m sure you know,
                 “Moore’s Law” says that “the number of transistors on
                 integrated circuits doubles approximately every two
                 years.” The R² of that rule (even in the more challenging
                 log-log form) is VERY high, at least on the 1971-2011
                 data at Wikipedia.
               o Marcus Mendez
                 Interesting, i will say this, apple’s bet on arm might
                 just be a waste of r&d dollars and big boost to bob
                 mansfield’s ego. Or put another way, apples bet on arm
                 doesn’t have to be so big. I mean, if apple were to buy a
                 foundry , arguable they kind of are, but the history is
                 they haven’t, then i get why you need your own cpu design
                 teams. But armh by default is a cpu designer. In other
                 words, why not use qualcom or generic arm design. If Armh
                 is commoditizing the cpu, why bother with that level of
                 design integration. It’s arguable it’s a differentiator.
                 The phones can’t last more than a day on battery power,
                 and the processing is done in the cloud. Speaking of
                 cloud, apple sucks here, and there getting taken to
                 school by google.
               o Walt French
                 @ptmmac:disqus wrote, “The factor not included in the
                 data is the lack of increase in processor speeds since
                 those are limited by frequency.”
                 This is just a terribly cramped understanding of
                 processors and also a misstatement of the BLS data shown
                 here.
                 I could not find detailed BLS methodology, but the agency
                 describes its attempts to measure “performance,” not
                 simply a single attribute such as speed. This would be
                 expected to (and, I think, does) account for the many
                 architectural feature enhancements in a CPU. For example,
                 bus speeds for communicating to memory, larger amounts of
                 on-die, high-speed cache memory, smarter handling of the
                 two different paths that can happen every time an IF
                 condition is tested, the number of simultaneous
                 instructions handled in each core, and many, many more.
                 (I think those are the most relevant.)
                 As an example, the current MacBookPro, with a 2.6GHz i7
                 CPU, delivers about 3X the throughput as this 4-year-old
                 MacBookPro, which has a 2.66GHz i7CPU (as measured by
                 GeekBench). You’ll see (roughly) similar performance in
                 desktop chips (a 17″ MBP, with a big battery, isn’t very
                 power-constrained), and in servers, which are likewise
                 very sensitive to time lags accessing memory, lags in
                 switching between processes etc.
                 The speed shown by this artificial benchmark has a
                 real-world impact. When I have many pages loaded in
                 Safari, my computer now can hang for a second or two when
                 switching between them. That’s new with Mavericks,
                 because the OS now compresses windows that are out of
                 sight, in order to keep more of them in memory. The
                 tradeoff allows me to keep MORE windows open, but the
                 performance suffers because the compress/expand logic
                 expects a faster CPU.
                 Of course, a personal computer is MUCH more than just the
                 CPU, and the index measures personal purchases that
                 include monitors, disk drives, networking gear and more.
                 Those other items have NOT increased performance at
                 30%/year, so today’s index is dropping at a slower rate.
                 Processor improvements are ALSO increasingly difficult to
                 come by; Intel has obviously been smart enough to go for
                 the lowest-hanging fruit in making their processors more
                 attractive at a given price and heat budget.
                 Most desktop machines don’t really need much CPU so if
                 you look at what people buy, it looks like Intel is
                 slowing down much more. But the BLS even attempts to
                 accommodate that, tracking budget, midrange and
                 hi-performance definitions of PCs.
                 As I originally noted, the price/performance declines
                 have slowed down — and my original point, that of showing
                 the index on a log scale, actually shows that
                 improvements have come a bit slower. (See the chart!) But
                 they have not hit a brick wall, as using just clock speed
                 falsely implies.
                 I think this answers your question: the easy-to-see clock
                 speed is fine for comparisons within a single
                 architecture, but wildly misleading across time; analysts
                 who follow the industry know this and steer journalists
                 from drawing bad conclusions. We should do the same.
               o insight
                 Oh, is that what “the chart” meant, when there’s several
                 in the article.
               o Walt French
                 Semilog charts are ideal for understanding rates of
                 change, almost imperative when there are are a couple of
                 orders of magnitude in play. They’re inferior for
                 understanding the absolute (rather than relative)
                 magnitudes of two or more items at selected points in
                 time, as the last two charts do.
                 A price index has no absolute value — the BLS arbitrarily
                 picks a date where the value is 100 and shows the
                 relative change from there, , so the absolute magnitude
                 is really without interest.

       Shared values are the foundation of loyalty. The Mac community
       proved resilient even in tough times and the community of Mac
       developers, although small, proved to be invaluable to iOS because
       of its shared values. “Community” gets talked about a lot with
       regard to products nowadays, but how many of those communities have
       shared values and how many are merely groups of customers? Having a
       product in common isn’t enough; that product has to embody values
       shared by the business and the customer.
       What I think is most important to see, though, is that other
       companies communicate their values with their customers too, it’s
       just that those values constitute a cold-hearted utilitarianism.
       They establish a contract with their customers: “we do x, y and z –
       it says it right here on the box – and if you can find someone else
       who does x, y and z for a cheaper price, go to them.” The
       relationship is fickle from the start, because it’s defined that
       way from the start. What sort of relationship does market research
       imply? Or focus groups? Or A/B testing? What sort of relationship
       do business and marketing books full of the psychology of
       manipulation imply?
       This is what Apple understands and Jony Ive articulates so well.
       Most analysts don’t understand it because they share the
       utilitarian values of a Microsoft or a Samsung. In fact, I wonder
       if this story is less the triumph of Apple and more the failure of
       business theory, because that whole edifice has been constructed on
       the wrong moral philosophy.

            As you so cogently point out, the rules only work for those
            that abide by them. Therefore, to answer Horace’s question,
            Apple prefers to ignore the rules, concentrate exclusively on
            the customer, and make a ton of money.
               o Johan Du Toit
                 Apple doesn’t ignore the rules, people are just looking
                 at the wrong rules and thus inferring the wrong
                 conclusions about Apple. Apple doesn’t sell a homogenous
                 product, and isn’t in the hardware business, it’s in the
                 tech ecosystem business.
               o http://www.laugh-eat.com/ kyron
                 nope. they built the ecosystem to sell more hardware. you

       The key thing is that Apple products continue to enable the user to
       do more with them with less work, and continue to pay for
       themselves in a short amount of time.
       If Apple had not brought CoreAudio and CoreMIDI to iOS and enabled
       real multitrack audio and music in GarageBand and thousands of 3rd
       party apps, then I might think my current iPhone was expensive. But
       instead, this $700 phone replaced over $1000 of dedicated music and
       audio gear, and the iPhone setup (with Apogee audio hardware) is
       faster and has much more storage and much longer battery life and
       is much smaller and lighter.
       The same happened with photo and video and art tools for many
       users.
       Samsung, on the other hand, has re-skinned a bunch of baby Java
       phone apps that are barely better than Web apps. I can’t make a
       $400 Sansung device pay for itself, let alone a $700 one.
     * Space Gorilla
       The Mac survived (and has thrived) by aligning with its customers
       needs and jobs-to-be-done. It’s a bit confusing why so many people
       don’t understand what Apple is doing. Make something great that
       your customers love and sell it for a profit. It ain’t rocket
       science.

       “Judging by how Apple is valued…”
       It seems that investors cannot get over the low valuation of AAPL
       recently when it could not be simpler. When Apple stock was
       shooting for the moon it had incredible year over year growth,
       things got frothy as they are wont to do in that situation. As soon
       as the market quite correctly sensed things were leveling off, as
       they must, the price dropped and has been range bound according to
       its growth prospects. Yes, the PE ratio is low but in line with the
       likes of, dare I say it, Microsoft, who the market perceives to
       have similar prospects. Apple fans seem to be having a lot of
       trouble coming to terms with the fact that the party is over until
       Apple can show that it can move the needle on growth. I have faith
       that they can do that but we’ll have to take a deep breath until we
       see the next shiny object. It’s a logical outcome and I think the
       manipulation angle is way overblown. It’s just the growth outlook
       people, no need to complicate things.

            “…the market quite correctly sensed…”
            Unless “the market” doesn’t quite know what senses are the
            correct ones to apply or listen to. “Leveling off” and “growth
            prospects” seem to relate to perceived marketshare prospects —
            as though once Android has hold of a piece, that’s it, game
            over for Apple. Nah.
            What “Apple fans seem to be having a lot of trouble coming to
            terms with” is not that “the party is over” — on the contrary,
            it is just beginning. Rather, what they have trouble coming to
            terms with is how others believe Mobile will play out anything
            like desktop. And since it is already a very different
            situation in so many ways, I think it is the pundits and
            Android fans who have trouble coming to terms with how
            different it all is this time round — where the values are,
            what the synergies are, etc..
            Facebook just paid 16B +3B stock for Whatsapp! So, Apple maps
            and Siri haven’t quite lived up to expectations yet? Does
            anyone realize what Apple could do with anything if it threw
            16B at it?
               o rational2
                 Apple has the money, so what’s stopping it from “doing

                 No idea. But I certainly don’t think they are out of
                 ideas or up against the wall, waiting for some epiphany
                 to drop out of the sky — which is what many seem to
                 believe. At the same time, they aren’t going to drop 12B
                 on a large acquisition and sell it for a loss the
                 following year.

                 For what it’s worth, this is exactly the argument people
                 used as Microsoft started to stall. Indeed, the same
                 argument was used when RIM had a fat bank account and
                 people started pointing out coming troubles.
                 “They have lots of money, therefore success is assured.”
                 Does anyone think Apple isn’t trying? That they aren’t
                 beating their heads trying to make a wearable or home
                 entertainment solution that will be the next trillion
                 dollar product? Of course they are. This plateau has been
                 obvious for years, and here we are, talking about it,
                 instead of talking about how Apple busted open yet
                 another market.
                 Apple might do great things, or they might not. But
                 having a big bank account in no way guarantees anything.

            many people (analysts included) don’t understand Apple. If you

            Macs were not so much luxury items as hardware+software UFOs.
            The fact that Apple are alone in that niche doesn’t help
            legitimatizing it either (is that a word ? It is in French but
            the English version looks weird).

            higher than that.
            Contrast this with Google, a company in a market which has had

            market, where prices are falling sharply to residual value,
            and once there stabilize.”
            During the last 16 years, PCs have been utterly driven by the
            Wintel consortium, both of which grew an already-huge market
            share. That’s the antithesis of commoditization (where all
            sellers offer an utterly undifferentiated product). Pretty
            clearly, the mother board’s support chips, memory chips, disk
            drives and other components also came from extremely
            competitive, but leapfrogging firms. Finally, the nameplate is
            not a commodity either, as customers latch onto brands for
            signals about quality and value, too.
            Net-net: no, consumers still actively choose brand and
            features in PCs.
            “Apple being a premium brand don’t participate in the race to
            the bottom, but what really surprises me is that no PC maker
            (Sony tried with Vaio line) was able to at least step in the
            range between the bottom feeders and Apple.”
            Half of selling PCs is selling thru what Jobs called
            “orifices” at Enterprises—the IT mavens (a phrase that had to
            have been calculated to insult). Especially in early years, a
            lot of home purchasers used PCs in their day jobs and worked
            with similar hardware at home. Sony, which at the checkbox
            level had undifferentiated products and higher prices, was
            disadvantaged.
            One of the early comments I heard from Cook was that Apple
            acted as a Systems Integrator with its products, whereas
            buying components off the shelf explicitly requires that
            expertise by the buyer, and even a lot of the “will this
            printer work with this version of Windows on this hardware”
            questions required expertise/access that most individuals
            don’t have—and that Sony, as a niche player, imposed more
            angst on their customers. I agree that the Sony hardware was
            always beautiful, but there were always the nagging questions
            about compatibility, availability of replacement parts, etc.
            Quality of a consumer product is a lot more than a well-built,
            attractive design.
               o obarthelemy
                 The funny thing, a lot of that angst applies to Apple
                 hardware too. Getting software, peripherals/drivers, and
                 hardware upgrades is a delicate proposition, when not

       This a silly argument. On average the market isn’t wrong, so unless
       apple creates/buys new categories then their margins will
       deteriorate . That said when the market is wrong, it can be by a
       lot. The market doesn’t know what it doesn’t know, so they can’t
       really price unseen innovation, but right now they don’t seem to be
       overly impressed with Cooke. Cooke and jobs were dynamite. Cooke
       and Ive are still to be determined, but so far we’ve seen a lot of
       petty politics and continued evolution of successful products( a
       few I own ). The reality to me are macs like iPhones are a niche
       and very profitable market.
       To me pc video cards are sort of similar. Nvda has been able to
       carve out a niche out of a market that most people don’t care
       about. Frankly , if there is one lesson apple has taught is that
       you don’t always need the most market share, just the most
       profitable. Further, consumers aren’t stupid at the High end and
       they won’t buy crap. On average apples products have higher costing
       components, artisan like craftsmanship, at a bargain price(
       relatively) that tempts most even if they can’t afford or justify
       it. Cooke gets this and the data you show is consequence not a
       predictor or cause .

            “On average the market isn’t wrong, so unless apple

            Why? Have their margins deteriorated so much on the Mac? They
            could still be a very profitable company from the Mac only.
               o Marcus Mendez
                 The market doesn’t care about current margins, but future
                 margins. But there isn’t one number right. This is not
                 something that gets proven by some thesis on stock
                 valuation. One big debate is really growth vs value, can
                 apple continue to grow the top line. Any way i think as a
                 user of apple products, which I am, and i think this is
                 particularly important given that at the end of the day,
                 we/ i am the target market, at what point do i believe
                 that i’ve got the ultimate phone. That maybe i don’t even
                 want a phone at all. What if someone else creates this
                 future or if the market just stagnates and all these
                 things are just commoditized pieces of glass and silicon.
                 Why will apple be able to keep their margins/sales in
                 such a future? This is the future that google is trying
                 to create and it is an eminent threat to apple as the
                 premium device (bauble ) maker in the world.

                 doing something others are not.
                 your hypotheticals are pointless. apple has shown that

                 competition.

                 it’s a Mac or an iThing, Apple keeps an existing device
                 the same price over the years, and add RAM or SSDs and
                 other new features to keep the price from falling. And
                 they enter new fields and have a record of huge hits to

                 Exactly. He is basing his reasoning on hypothesis without

                 past.
               o Alex
                 I have to tell you it’s really hard to read your comment
                 as its structure is kinda special.
                 Anyway, if what’s important is the future, there is no
                 indication that the Mac will deteriorate that much. It
                 hasn’t in the past few years, and there is nothing major
                 that’s coming that might change that. Wearables certainly
                 aren’t going to disrupt it.
                 So again, if you say that we don’t know what the future
                 holds, the most reasonable thing to expect is that
                 Apple’s margins won’t deteriorate, not the contrary,
                 unless you have evidence that it might.
               o Marcus Mendez
                 I hear your point. The question is this perhaps. Is the
                 iPhone the iPod? nothing last forever. The valuations
                 imply it is. Let me give you another example, I for one
                 got upset years ago that i paid for text separate than
                 data on my at&t phone plan. I thought about things like
                 ting.com and I eventually switched to tmobile, partly
                 because i was just tired of being had and partly because
                 tmobile was providing a credible alternative for my usage
                 habits. Mind you I had at&t since the first iPhone. This
                 business is worth billions to the major telcos, at least
                 in the US. Now it is interesting that with iMessage apple
                 attacked this high margin business from telecom companies
                 like at&t by providing a free alternative, but only if I
                 both users are on apple devices. Let’s also not forget
                 that the original plans on the iPhone supposedly had
                 envisaged a future without the wireless telecoms. Fast
                 forward to last week and FB buys whatsapp (texting for
                 free essentially ) for 16b and people can’t understand
                 the valuation. In other words, users didn’t really want
                 to pay for something they can get for essentially free or
                 that they were double paying for (text is data or the
                 world is data ). I argue that all technology evolves to
                 commodity more or less and the margins will erode. We’re
                 just not be able to tell right away where the substation
                 effect is going to come from. Another personal story is I
                 have close and young member of my family ( a millennial )
                 and texting is far more important than voice as a medium
                 of communication. In what’s app it seems fb bought a
                 telecom co for cheap. If your telecom wireless provider,
                 you ought to wonder at what point will people eventually
                 stop paying for text. It was the golden goose that they
                 milked for too long.

                 http://macperformanceguide.com. Lloyd chambers does a
                 pretty good job of pointing out crucial technical areas
                 where apple keeps dropping the ball. I am photographer

                 that i think i would like to manage and edit on the new
                 mac pro, which is exceptional hardware, barring the
                 storage limitation, but Lloyd has been making the case
                 for some time that apple is dropping the ball on osx. At
                 some point if the core is rotting the bottom line will
                 fall out.

                 I am confused as to what you are objecting to, but you’re
                 missing the my main point it seems. Yes, like the cliche
                 from sam savage’s book, ( the flaw of averages ), plans
                 made on average on average fail, i am not actually trying
                 to make a qualitative statement on apple based on an
                 average. And if i did, which average did I use for you to
                 disagree with? An average is a number by definition and I
                 gave no numbers…I did not say that apple is not
                 exceptional or that they are not profitable above the
                 norm, or that Cooke/Jobs have found a clever and obvious
                 way to make them insane amounts of profits partially thru
                 global wage arbitrage. What i am saying is that in
                 generally, I respect the market, and more times than not,
                 it is right. If they are right, what does it really say

                 products. I am also from the Munger side when it comes to

               o aardman
                 What do you mean by the market being right or wrong? How
                 do you even know that the market is right or wrong? Are
                 you saying that the average, because it is the average,
                 is necessarily right? You realize that the market can be
                 wrong all the time and yet on average it is right, don’t
                 you? And that presupposes we have some way of knowing
                 what is right. I think what you mean is the market gets
                 it right once it is able to look backwards, but that’s
                 not exactly the critical perspective, right? It’s looking
                 ahead where all the interesting action is.
          + the Ugly Truth
            huh?
            if the market isn’t wrong…why doesn’t the market know what it
            doesn’t know?

       Horace, you can’t label the “Mac Volume” with “millions of units”
       while having descriptor numbers on the y-axis like this. Right now
       that graph gives the number of macs in Q4/2013 as 50,000 millions
       of units. That would be 50,000,000,000 Macs.
       Even if you take the y-axis description in the European sense of
       the comma, it would still be 50 million Macs.
       If I’m not wrong you want to depict millions (as you described it).
       The correct way would be to label it “Mac Volume (hundreds of
       units)” since 100 times 50,000 is 5 million.
       Oh and as always: nothings you write here considers earnings. I
       mean it’s neat that a Mac is three times as expensive as a regular
       PC but that says nothing about the earnings per Unit. I mean we all
       THINK we know how much the Chinese makers of those cheap PCs make,
       but do we REALLY know? No we don’t. Our gut feelings tell us that
       Apple earns more per Mac than a maker of regular PCs but then again
       Apple’s share prices are dictated by gut feelings as well so… ah
       whatever…
       It’s just curious that you keep banging the “revenue” drum like
       crazy when in the end what counts is earnings. And you don’t talk
       about earnings. At all. All the time.
       Yet every time Amazon is criticized here and elsewhere, you chide
       them for not being profitable.
       But uh, look at those revenues! HUGE! REVENUES!
       But again, whatever. I mean 91 comments and not one noticed that
       labeling error. It’s as if all your readers care about is numbers.
       You kind of have to question the way people read your site if you
       ask me. To be honest to me it feels like watching people watch Fox
       News or something. They want something to be true and there are
       graphs so hey – awesome. My preconceived notion is affirmed so
       everything I just read is awesome.
       I mean the sheer fact alone that the “30 year old mac” was also
       there in 97 when the company nearly went bust… ah whatever.
       Everything’s awesome so Macs are awesome.
       Awesome.

                 what was the profit margin back then?

                 Couple of points
                 1) I think Horace read what I wrote and then deleted so
                 he knows it
                 2) if you’d read my blog you’d know your remarks
                 regarding that are moot
                 3) if you think that the price of a Mac then and now
                 doesn’t have anything to do with the topic then
                 *drumroll* THERE YOU GO. Exactly what I was getting at.
                 There’s no way anyone who’s reading Asymco is going to
                 spend any time actually thinking about critically
                 comments because
                 10 Horace is right
                 20 goto 10
                 That’s why I deleted my comment. You’re not going to even
                 try to think about my statement about the price of Macs
                 back then and now. How hard was that to get anyway? Macs
                 have been priced at a 2 to 2.5 ratio to regular PCs back
                 when Apple was close to going bust and they are priced
                 the same way today. How that is NOT pertaining to the
                 friggin blog post is beyond me.
                 The differene between then and now is not that the price
                 is actually right but that just like Breitling watches or
                 Porsche 911s, Apple Macs have ALWAYS been priced like
                 this and always will be priced like this because Apple is
                 selling a brand and that brand needs to have the feeling
                 of being something higher class. That’s not a criticism
                 of Apple but to me it’s a given. Saying that today the
                 “price is right” to me is… I don’t even know what it is…
                 it feels like looking at data and desperately trying to
                 find a narrative for a blog post and then hammering the
                 data into the right form so people can look at it and go
                 “Wow, he’s right”.
                 It’s like going to church or to a card reader in the way
                 that you already know what you want to here and lo and
                 behold here you get it. Exactly what you want – the
                 feeling that the product is priced right because look at
                 the data – people are buying in droves.
                 To me, the price ISN’T what the data reflects. That is my
                 whole point. To me, the data reflects the changes in the
                 company in that FINALLY after decades of putting mediocre
                 products for the price on the market, with OS X and
                 Laptops with an insane running time (battery life),
                 FINALLY the products fit the bill of these prices.
                 “Caring about the product” also isn’t a factor to me. I
                 just don’t see the data fitting ANYTHING of what Horace
                 wrote but hey, that’s just me actually thinking about the
                 topic at hand.
                 Oh and another angle would be that people are buying Macs
                 because they never would’ve thought about getting one if
                 not for their iOS devices but what do I know. Something
                 Gruber said three years ago.
                 But hey colorful graph is colorful. So data. Much
                 impress.

                 Apparently cheng read what I wrote in the first three
                 minutes it was online and chose to comment.
                 Most of it is now in the answers to cheng, the “5000
                 Million = 5,000,000,000″ bit is about the graph which has
                 the number of Macs as “millions of units”. With the
                 vertical axis being labeled “thousands of units” and the
                 graph showing the number of Macs sold being between 1,000
                 and 5,000 following graph labeling conventions this would
                 mean there were up to 5,000 “millions of units” sold and
                 5,000 millions is 5,000,000 * 5,000 and that’s
                 5,000,000,000
                 Anyway, don’t bother with this thread anymore, I said my
                 piece and it’s ok to ignore it now.

       Sigh. The premise of this article and these graphs is completely
       wrong. You state that hardware prices fall over time. This is a
       misinterpretation of the law of commoditisation. It is also a
       complete misinterpretation of Apple’s business model: Apple isn’t
       just a hardware manufacturer. The iOS and OSX ecosystems are
       Apple’s products, not hardware. Apple is the only company on earth
       that sells these clearly differentiated products while the rest
       sell hardware. They are thus alone in their market, commoditisation
       does not apply and your data is moot. Apple does not sell a
       homogenous product and thus they are more akin to a monopoly when
       it comes to market forces. Furthermore, looking at a graph about
       the averages in the hardware market while discussing Apple is
       misguided at best. We all know Apple doesn’t sell average products
       they sell premium products. Therefore if you DO insist on comparing
       them to this market, you should compare them to the premium segment
       of the market only. I don’t have the data on hand, but I’m sure if
       you compare them to only Alienware or only Samsung’s flagship
       devices the graphs will match up more closely. I really feel you
       should make sure you understand the fundamentals of market laws
       better if you plan on writing articles about market trends. These
       concepts are explained well in University level Economics classes
       worldwide.

                 I know exactly what monopoly means thank you. It
                 describes a company that is alone in it’s market, thus
                 has near full control over pricing. Do you know what it

            you have it backwards — apple’s ecosystem exists to enable
            selling more hardware. the hardware is not a side effect of
            the ecosystem.
               o Johan Du Toit
                 All the evidence in this post points to me having it
                 exactly right. The hardware is the gateway into the
                 ecosystem, the ecosystem is the product. Thus Apple is
                 not selling a commodity, thus explaining all the market
                 behaviour surrounding their products, thus proving that
                 Apple is not some magical force that causes everyone to
                 go nuts and all economic theories and rules to fly out
                 the window.

            True – it would be like trying to glean something by trying to
            draw comparisons between any luxury brand and trying to draw
            similarities with their “common folk” equivalents. For
            example, brands like Coach and Gucci swim in their own markets
            because they target a different segment of the buying public
            than their “common folk” counterparts. So trying to draw
            similarities consumer trends between them is comparing apples
            and oranges – they aren’t necessarily competing for the same
            consumers. And we know for example, that luxury brands are NOT
            following the same market trends as “common folk brands” as
            luxury brands are doing quite well because the wealthy are
            doing quite well, unlike the “common folk” space.
            So kyron you have it backwards – it’s not about Apple’s
            business strategy (ecosystem or hardware) its about the
            _product_ people are buying. And in the case of Apple, it IS
            the ecosystem that that Apple has produced that people are
            buying into. That is people aren’t buying just the hardware,
            they’re buying into the whole Apple ecosystem. And that’s a
            different type market than people who just buy a piece of PC
            hardware. And where the product and market is “the Apple
            ecosystem” that is distinct from PC hardware, then yes Apple
            is a monopolist in that market. If you want to buy into the
            Apple ecosystem as a product, there’s only one game in town
            and that’s Apple. If you want to buy in the PC market there
            are a number of players to choose from.

            commoditisation.”
            Well, of course, commoditization doesn’t just happen because
            of time; it is caused by producers seeing an opportunity to
            gain business by producing an undifferentiated commodity. But
            especially in a business with rapidly-changing tech,
            businesses have to learn how to produce the new
            state-of-the-art products, design them, and ramp up
            production. All that takes time, so commoditization happens
            over time.
            Or maybe I’m misinterpreting what you call the “law of
            commoditisation.” — Google dished up articles about
            commodities law and “how to keep your law practice from being
            commoditized” so please feel to express what this law
            represents if NOT the notion that disruptive changes are
            eventually suffused through an industry.
            So no wonder you’re exasperated that we don’t get it: you’ve
            skipped the point you think we should understand.
               o Johan Du Toit
                 I am referring to commoditisation. You can take the law
                 part out if it bothers you. Commoditisation almost always
                 happens over time and not instantly, yes, but I’m a bit
                 confused as to your point?
                 To put my point a bit more succinctly and without all the
                 snarkiness: 1) New markets tend to become commodity
                 markets over time, that does not mean Apple is competing
                 in this commoditised hardware market by default. 2) Apple
                 alone sells their ecosystem. The market behaviour proves
                 that customers believe this is a clearly differentiated
                 product alone in its own market 3) Thus all the market
                 behaviour around Apple products is completely normal and
                 not breaking any rules or universal laws, as Apple should
                 be analysed as a Monopolistic company not as a company
                 competing in a commoditised market.

       I’m a little disappointed with Mr. Dediu’s analysis here; he rarely
       makes glaring omissions of the sort he commits here. The Windows PC
       as a whole remains more profitable than the PC manufacturers’
       numbers belie. It’s just that the profits are siphoned off by
       Microsoft. Yes prices of Windows PCs have been on a steep downward
       trend but this is mostly from the vicious, cutthroat competition
       among the hardware manufacturers. What is the trend on the price of
       Windows itself?
       We should also note that Apple fends off downward price pressure by
       ramping up hardware specs. e.g. Instead of cutting prices, they’ll
       raise the RAM or storage, or shift from HDs to SSDs.

            But you’re actually missing the point WORSE by claiming the
            Microsoft tax leaves the profitability comparable.
            IF Microsoft gets $80 per OEM Windows license (and IIRC the
            number might be half that) and IF they’re still in the
            stratospheric 90%+ gross margin, then that’s $72 per device —
            tops.
            In contrast, we see the Mac at around $1250 ASP, with Horace’s
            estimate of 26% gross margin, yielding $325 per device.
            Microsoft may be capturing all the PC profitability, and at
            its huge 90%+ share of the desktop, that’s a huge business.
            But on a per-unit basis, the PC yields less than a quarter of
            the profitability.
            I’m not sure why you think it relevant that Macs regularly get
            spec upgrades. You simply can’t buy, because nobody bothers to
            build, a desktop machine with leading-edge specs from 2004. A
            simple glance at the weekend ads from Best Buy shows i5 or i7
            processors, multi-GB RAM, etc., that was too expensive a few
            years back, but that customers now find worth the modest extra
            expense.

                 The price of an average Windows PC is something like $600
                 so Windows gross profit alone is 13% of the price of a
                 PC. Add the higher gross profit of components and there
                 is not so much difference between gross profit of a Mac
                 and a PC
               o Walt French
                 Now I think you’re deeply into Apples & oranges. Gross
                 profit of components? To the extent that they are very
                 similar for a given level of quality, there should be no
                 reason to add those to one platform but not another.
                 The story still stands: 13% of a $600 PC is a quarter of
                 26% of a $1250 Mac. Add in the little gross margin at the
                 manufacturers, and it’s still a lopsided contrast.
               o charly
                 Nvidia makes more money on their chips sold to PC makes
                 than to Apple. Especially the mom&pop operations are much
                 more profitable for Nvidia than Apple.
                 ps. According to the Guardian article PC ASP was $544
                 though by looking at only the top 5
                 Mac ASP was $1200 but they include more often a screen

                 According to the article this post belongs to the average
                 price of a PC is even less at $544 though that is
                 probably due to it including Acer/Asus who’s PC’s are
                 mostly sold in the low end while not including the
                 boutique high end PC sells.

            “What is the trend on the price of Windows itself?” — What,
            like the 70% drop in OEM price they announced yesterday?

                 Remove the dvd, shift from HDD to SSD, be low on RAM and
                 go Atom add the end of XP and you will see a lot of
                 desktops (Or should i say minitops) around April/May
