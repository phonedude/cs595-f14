Gentrification's Price : S.F. Moves: Yuppies In, the Poor Out

   April 03, 1985|DAN MORAIN | Times Staff Writer

   SAN FRANCISCO — After living 35 years in the same North Beach
   apartment, Frances Brandolino and her husband discovered there was no
   longer room for them in this city.

   A group of lawyers bought the 17-unit Victorian building in which they
   had been living to convert it into offices. Unable to find a place they
   could afford in San Francisco, the Brandolinos ended up in the suburb
   of Brisbane, where the $500-a-month rent still is more than twice what
   it was in their rent-controlled North Beach apartment.

   It isn't that the family is poor. Frances Brandolino, 62, part owner of
   a small North Beach hamburger stand, and her husband, a printer, earn
   about $30,000 a year. But the family simply could not afford apartments
   that in North Beach go for "$900 or $1,000 a month," she said.

   Story Is Typical

   The Brandolinos' story is being repeated throughout San Francisco,
   where a decade-long building boom has transformed the city's skyline
   and its population. One example is the Brandolinos' old neighborhood,
   once a thriving Italian district, later an enclave for beatniks, now
   home to chic restaurants, high-rent apartments and increasing numbers
   of offices.

   In short, San Francisco has become perhaps the most gentrified large
   city in the nation. Districts that a decade ago were blue collar are
   now ghettos for young urban professionals, who have spawned a
   consumptive economy in which one highly successful new chain mass
   markets croissants, sort of a Yuppie version of Winchell's doughnut
   shops.

   The change has created a new vocabulary: Yuppification,
   croissantification, Manhattanization. City Planning Director Dean
   Macris calls it the "boutiquing of San Francisco."

   Whatever its name, its result is spiraling housing costs, clogged
   traffic, an exodus of middle-class and poor families and declining
   black and Latino populations. And the trend seems certain to continue
   despite a new effort by the city to limit growth, restrain housing
   costs and preserve neighborhoods.

   'Post-Industrial City'

   Some social scientists call San Francisco the "archetypical
   post-industrial city," one with an economy based not on steel plants or
   breweries, but on silicon chips, corporate headquarters, international
   trade, banking, law. And its residents reflect that.

   Several other big cities--Boston and Philadelphia, among them--are
   experiencing similar changes. But here, the difference is in degree.

   "It is clear to me that San Francisco has experienced each of these
   changes . . . earlier and to a greater extent than any other area in
   the country," said demographer Kevin McCarthy of the Santa Monica-based
   Rand Corp.

   Of the 13 largest cities in the nation in 1980, San Francisco (current
   population 706,900) had the largest percentage (22%) of residents
   between ages 25 and 34, the segment of the population most likely to
   have children. It also had the lowest percentage of children 13 and
   younger.

   Of those 13 largest cities, San Francisco was one of only two that
   showed a drop in black population between the 1970 and 1980 censuses.
   San Francisco's black population declined 10%, or about 10,000. San
   Antonio, the only other city in the top 13 to record a loss, showed a
   0.3% decline.

   During the same period, the number of Latinos in San Francisco also
   dropped by roughly 10%, or about 10,000, Latino leaders here say,
   although the census did not count that group separately in 1970.

   The number of Asians, now about a third of the population, is
   increasing rapidly. But for the most part, Asians and other minorities
   do not hold the high-paying office jobs.

   White Work Force

   A recent city report says that two-thirds of the downtown work force is
   white, and that whites hold three-fourths of the management and
   technical jobs. Those jobs have the highest salaries, with more than
   half paying at least $25,000, making San Francisco paychecks among the
   fattest of the largest cities.

   Growth proponents say the building boom merely reflects San Francisco's
   healthy economy. Bob Hayden of the Chamber of Commerce called the
   downtown high-rises "vertical factories." And those factories keep the
   city's unemployment rate to about 6%.

   Mayor Dianne Feinstein builds on that by pitching San Francisco to
   foreign investors, who finance much of the construction. So far this
   year, she has been to London and the Far East on trade missions.

   But while the city bustles, some researchers sound notes of caution,
   not only for San Francisco but for other cities that rely on service
   industries for employment. Several corporations--Bank of America,
   Pacific Bell--have moved much of their operations to suburbs, where
   land costs less and where work, done largely on computer, can be done
   just as easily.

   Vacancy Rate Grows

   A few years ago, there were no vacant offices here. Now, there is a 10%
   vacancy rate.
