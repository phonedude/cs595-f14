The secret of Minecraft

And its challenge to the rest of us
     __________________________________________________________________

   It’s almost inevitable: I encounter Minecraft somewhere online—it’s
   easy to do, because there’s a lot of Minecraft out there—and I end up
   convinced I’m doing the wrong thing with my life.

   Let me explain.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Briefly, for the uninitiated: Minecraft is a video game, first released
   in 2009 as a buggy prototype by a solo Swedish programmer named Markus
   Persson. The complete game was released in 2011, and in the years
   since, Minecraft has matured, expanded, and sold tens of millions of
   copies.

   Oh, and there’s a documentary.

   Also, T-shirts.

   I am obsessed with this game and what it has achieved. If you are a
   writer, a cartoonist, a filmmaker, a designer—really, anyone who
   aspires to engage human brains, particularly young ones—I think you
   should be, too.
     __________________________________________________________________

   In Minecraft, the player is dropped into a freshly-generated world
   composed of coarse blocks that represent dirt, trees, rock, water, and
   more:

   There are dangerous creatures lurking in this world, including but not
   limited to giant spiders and skeleton archers. But they only venture
   out at night, and they can be deterred by walls. The sun (a bright
   cube) sets fast, so your first task is always the same: Build a
   shelter.

   The genius of Minecraft is that the game does not specify how this is
   done.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The game’s core activity is the creation of new materials and objects
   through the arrangement of more basic substances in specific patterns
   on a “crafting table,” represented in the game as a matrix of cells.

   To me, these Minecraft “recipes” resemble nothing so much…

   [1*XGdecLgAp2itsvkWGM5YnQ.jpeg]

   …as arcane runes.

   To play the game, you need to know the runes, the recipes. Where do you
   learn them? Not in Minecraft. There is no senior alchemist to consult.

   No help menu.

   No manual.

   People often compare Minecraft to LEGO; both support open-ended
   creation (once you’ve mastered the crafting table, you can build nearly
   anything) and, of course, they share an essential blockiness. But I
   think this comparison is misleading, because a LEGO set always includes
   instructions, and Minecraft comes with none.

   Minecraft is a game about creation, yes. But it is just as much a game
   about secret knowledge.
     __________________________________________________________________

   It’s not that secret, of course. From that first buggy release onward,
   all the ins and outs of surviving and building in Minecraft have been
   documented by players, on wikis and YouTube, in ever-increasing and now
   mind-boggling detail. Honestly, I have no idea how you would play the
   game without first browsing one of those wikis or watching one of those
   videos. Trial and error? There would be a lot of errors.

   To play, you must seek information elsewhere.

   Was it a conscious decision? A strategic bit of design? I don’t know.
   Maybe Markus Persson always intended to create an in-game tutorial but
   never got around to it. If so: lucky him, and lucky us, because by
   requiring the secret knowledge to be stored, and sought, elsewhere, he
   laid the foundation for Minecraft’s true form.

   Minecraft-the-game, maintained in Sweden by Persson’s small studio, is
   just the seed, or maybe the soil. The true Minecraft (no italics, for
   we are speaking of something larger now) is the game plus the sprawling
   network of tutorials, wikis, galleries, videos—seriously, search for
   “minecraft” on YouTube and be amazed—mods, forum threads, and more. The
   true Minecraft is the oral tradition: secrets and rumors shared in chat
   rooms, across cafeteria tables, between block-faced players inside the
   game itself.

   The true Minecraft is the books.

   Scholastic publishes these concise, child-friendly guides to the game.
   Two of them are among the best-selling books of 2014 so far, on a short
   list with titles like The Fault in Our Stars and The Goldfinch. To me,
   they are the most salient symbol of the game’s success.

   Imagine yourself a child. Imagine yourself given one of these books:
   not merely a story of exploration and adventure, but a manual to such.
   [1*FkJK1Xumbwf1o5ys3vbBbw.jpeg]

   Imagine yourself acquiring the keys to a mutable world in which you can
   explore caves, fight spiders, build castles, ride pigs, blow up
   mountains, construct aqueducts to carry water to your summer palace…
   anything.

   Imagine yourself a child, in possession of the secret knowledge.
     __________________________________________________________________

   This wouldn’t be enough on its own. Obscure techniques have been a part
   of video games from the beginning; Nintendo Power surely had a dusting
   of secret knowledge. What’s different here is that Minecraft connects
   this lure to the objective not of beating the game, but making more of
   the game.

   “Game” doesn’t even do it justice. What we’re really talking about here
   is a generative, networked system laced throughout with secrets.

   Five years in, Minecraft (the system) has bloomed into something bigger
   and more beautiful than any game studio — whether a tiny one like
   Markus Persson’s or a huge one like EA — could ever produce on its own.
   The scale of it is staggering; overwhelming. As you explore the
   extended Minecraft-verse online, you start to get the same oceanic
   feeling that huge internet systems like YouTube and Twitter often
   inspire: the mingling of despair (“I’ll never see it all”) with delight
   (“People made this”) with dizzying anthropic awe (“So… many… people.”)

   Turns out you can do a lot with those blocks.
   [1*iUWXt0N6GF2NgjwcbnomTg.jpeg]
   WesterosCraft. OMG.

   We’re in a new century now, and its hallmark is humans doing things
   together, mostly on screens, at scales unimaginable in earlier times.

   In the 2010s and beyond, it is not the case that every cultural product
   ought to be a generative, networked system.

   It is, I believe, the case that all the really important ones will be.

   To ignore the creative power of all these brains—millions and millions
   of them, young and old—leaves too much on the table.

   I’m a writer, and don’t get me wrong: To publish a plain ol’ book that
   people actually want to read is still a solid achievement. But I think
   Markus Persson and his studio have staked out a new kind of
   achievement, a deeper kind: To make the system that calls forth the
   book, which is not just a story but a real magick manual that grants
   its reader (who consumes it avidly, endlessly, all day, at school, at
   night, under the covers, studying, studying) new and exciting powers in
   a vivid, malleable world.

   I’m not a huge Minecraft player myself—my shelter never grew beyond the
   rough-hewn Robinson Crusoe stage—but I look at those books and, I tell
   you: I am eight years old again. I feel afresh all the impulses that
   led me towards books and writing, toward the fantastic and
   science-fictional… except now, there is this other door.

   It’s made of blocks, I suppose.

   “A generative, networked system laced throughout with secrets.”

   When you write it that way, you realize it doesn’t have to be software.
   This is a stretch, but you could apply that description to the greater
   Star Wars universe—not just the movies, but all that followed: the
   books, the video games, the spit-spraying backyard lightsaber battles.
   And, based on all the fan fiction and wizard rock they inspired, I’d
   say the Harry Potter books managed to boot up a generative, networked
   system of some sort.

   But now, in the 2010s, Minecraft improves upon those examples, because
   it does not merely allow this co-creation but requires it. And so the
   burning question in my brain right now is this: What happens when we
   take the secret of Minecraft and apply it elsewhere, in new ways?

   My next book is going to be a plain ol’ book; a good one, I hope, but
   definitely not a generative, networked system, etc.

   My next next book, though… well, I don’t yet know what shape it will
   take. But I have my eye on Minecraft.
