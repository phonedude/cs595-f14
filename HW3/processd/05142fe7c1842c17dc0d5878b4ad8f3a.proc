Place for public-private partnerships in cyberspace

   Public private partnerships (PPPs) haven't been such a happy
   experiment. Using private money to build arterial roads just increases
   their cost because private capital requires much higher returns than
   government borrowing.

   But I've long wondered about a different kind of PPP that plays to the
   respective strengths of public and private sectors, rather than their
   weaknesses.

   The economic textbook says governments must build public goods because
   private endeavour can capture only a tiny

   fraction of their total value to society. But Google, Facebook, Twitter
   and Wikipedia are all privately provided public goods. What's going on?
   Advertisement

   These public goods generate far more social than private benefit, but
   there's still enough in it for the creators to make their creation
   worthwhile. Google probably generates more than $1 trillion worth of
   value, so advertising revenue of a tiny fraction of that still manages
   to generate a few lousy tens of billions. Meanwhile, the platform of
   Wikipedia was philanthropically created, which leverages the voluntary
   contributions of the expert and energetic few for the benefit of all.

   It's lucky these public goods didn't need government involvement,
   because building them required the insight, drive and steadfast purpose
   of some of the finest entrepreneurs alive. That pretty much rules
   government out of the job description.

   But what about all those potential public goods or platforms that
   languish undeveloped because there just aren't the incentives for
   private entrepreneurs to deliver them without government help? A
   public-private partnership might bring them into existence.

   I'd come to that conclusion by 2009 while participating in the
   Government 2.0 Taskforce, which explored the implications of ''Web
   2.0'', or social media for governments. But it wasn't until last year
   until I came upon a really compelling example. At the Health 2.0
   Conference in San Francisco I listened to Anne Wojcicki, the wife of
   Google co-founder Sergey Brin and the co-founder and CEO of 23andMe.

   23andMe sends customers a kit to swab their saliva to enable 23andMe to
   genetically profile them. 23andMe customers then use that profile to
   help manage their health throughout their lives. This kind of genetic
   information isn't the godsend that people once thought it might be.
   Genes express themselves in complex ways. But already the information
   can be helpful in identifying some disease susceptibilities.

   And 23andMe is becoming a powerful platform for research. Customers
   complete 23andMe questionnaires that identify specific health
   characteristics to be cross-referenced with their genomic profile and
   as its database grows, its diagnostic and research power grows.
   Scientists have used 23andMe's database to publish in scholarly
   journals replicating 180 genetic associations with medical conditions
   that had previously been documented in the medical literature - at a
   fraction of the cost and time of traditional research.

   23andMe and its like will help take us to personalised medicine where
   medicines are targeted to specific individuals based on what's optimal
   for their genetic predisposition. Meanwhile, other countries are
   getting interested. The UK's National Health Service has announced a
   program of full genetic sequencing for 10,000 Britons.

   But as futuristic as it all sounds, the private sector on its own is
   making heavy weather of it. With a bank balance swelled to $50-odd
   million from its latest capital raising, 23andMe is cutting its prices
   - from $299 to $99, down from $999 in 2008 - to increase its customer
   base from about 200,000 to 1 million. But there are 7 billion people
   alive today.

   Public-private partnerships could put us in the express lane to the
   future. Genetic profiles for patients have an immediate capital value
   to our health system. They can help target screening and improve safety
   - for instance by better vigilance against allergies or drug reactions.
   That's worth more than $99 a patient right now. But at scale, unit
   costs would fall well below that.

   So Medicare could ''bulk bill'' genetic profiling while the health
   system ''nudged'' people to take advantage of free profiling, while
   allowing those who wished to, to opt out. DIY kits could be bulk-mailed
   as they were recently as part of our bowel cancer-screening program.
   And at your next visit your doctor could ask if you wanted to be
   swabbed right there.

   The provider of the profiling could be 23andMe or another company(ies).
   They'd have to open their database to researchers, with the contents
   duly anonymised and subject to safeguards to protect customer privacy.
   But they could also provide value-added services to their customers.

   And as Australia's genomic database grew, so, too, would its power as a
   diagnostic and research asset. It's hard to think of a more powerful
   way to kick-start the personalised medicine revolution just coming into
   view. And hard to think of a better way to put Australian researchers,
   Australian companies, and the Australian health system at the forefront
   of that revolution.
