   Open data—machine-readable information, particularly government data,
   that’s made available to others—has generated a great deal of
   excitement around the world for its potential to empower citizens,
   change how government works, and improve the delivery of public
   services. It may also generate significant economic value, according to
   a new McKinsey report.^1 1.The research for this report was jointly
   conducted by McKinsey’s Business Technology Office, the McKinsey Global
   Institute, and the public sector practice, which incorporates the
   McKinsey Center for Government. Our research suggests that seven
   sectors alone could generate more than $3 trillion a year in additional
   value as a result of open data, which is already giving rise to
   hundreds of entrepreneurial businesses and helping established
   companies to segment markets, define new products and services, and
   improve the efficiency and effectiveness of operations.

The open-data opportunity

     * Download

   MGI’s Michael Chui discusses the economic potential of open data and
   how governments and businesses can unlock it.

   Although the open-data phenomenon is in its early days, we see a clear
   potential to unlock significant economic value by applying advanced
   analytics to both open and proprietary knowledge. Open data can become
   an instrument for breaking down information gaps across industries,
   allowing companies to share benchmarks and spread best practices that
   raise productivity. Blended with proprietary data sets, it can propel
   innovation and help organizations replace traditional and intuitive
   decision-making approaches with data-driven ones. Open-data analytics
   can also help uncover consumer preferences, allowing companies to
   improve new products and to uncover anomalies and needless variations.
   That can lead to leaner, more reliable processes.

   However, investments in technology and expertise are required to use
   the data effectively. And there is much work to be done by governments,
   companies, and consumers to craft policies that protect privacy and
   intellectual property, as well as establish standards to speed the flow
   of data that is not only open but also “liquid.” After all, consumers
   have serious privacy concerns, and companies are reluctant to share
   proprietary information—even when anonymity is assured—for fear of
   losing competitive advantage.

   Our research sought to quantify the potential value of open data by
   examining applications in seven fields of the global economy:
   education, transportation, consumer products, electricity, oil and gas,
   health care, and consumer finance (exhibit). For each of these, we
   identified ways that open data may create economic value, explored
   potential barriers to adoption, and considered which actions would be
   required for capturing value with open data. In fact, we found numerous
   ways it could drive growth and innovation across industries and
   sectors. In summary, the use of open data:
     * has a large potential economic value from its benefits, including
       increased efficiency, new products and services, and a consumer
       surplus (cost savings, convenience, better products)
     * enhances big data’s impact by creating transparency, exposing
       variability, and enabling experimentation; helping companies to
       segment populations and thus to customize actions directed at them;
       replacing or supporting human decision making; and spurring
       innovative business models, products, and services
     * creates multiple business opportunities, such as the potential to
       raise productivity, to improve new products and services, and to
       enable entirely novel lines of business for both established
       companies and entrants
     * benefits consumers even more than businesses, by creating price and
       product transparency as well as new channels to provide feedback
       that improves the quality of goods and services (including public
       ones)
     * entails business risks, including reputational issues related to
       the potential release of negative information; the potential
       consumer backlash from aggressive open-data use (for instance, in
       ads that target online consumers by following social-media
       activity); and the inadvertent release of confidential information,
       such as benchmarking data
     * requires governments to play a central role by developing and
       implementing policies to mitigate consumer and business concerns
       about the misuse of open data and to help set standards that will
       allow the potential economic and social benefits to materialize
     * faces barriers, including privacy concerns and the need for legal
       and regulatory frameworks

   The benefits of open data can be self-reinforcing: they will increase
   as individuals perceive the advantages and help to improve the accuracy
   and detail of the information available. However, this cycle can gather
   momentum only if private industry and public agencies cultivate a
   vibrant open-data ecosystem and implement policies to protect
   stakeholders. For companies, that means putting in place the
   technologies and talent to collect and analyze data. For individuals—as
   both consumers and citizens—it means being vigilant, savvy providers
   and users of open data.
